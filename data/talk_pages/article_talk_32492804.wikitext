Please refrain from introducing inappropriate pages, such as [[:Minh MyMagicalFriend Bui]], to Wikipedia. Doing so is not in accordance with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]]. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Minh MyMagicalFriend Bui|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-vandalism-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Cntras|Cntras]] ([[User talk:Cntras|talk]]) 05:10, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
