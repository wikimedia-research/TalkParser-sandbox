Has anyone carried out research into the name Sibbald and how this area came to be known as Sibbald? Is it from the Scottish surname Sibbald? [[User:183.177.120.28|183.177.120.28]] ([[User talk:183.177.120.28|talk]]) 03:07, 27 November 2011 (UTC) 

:From ''Alberta Place Names'' by Larry Donovan &amp; Tom Monto (2006, Dragon Hill Publishing Ltd.)...
::&quot;There are different stories of how this hamlet received its name. Perhaps it was named after John Sibbald, a railway engineer, or possibly after Frank Sibbald, an early rancher in the area.&quot;
