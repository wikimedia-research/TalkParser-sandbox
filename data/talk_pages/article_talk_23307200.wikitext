==Disambiguation link notification for April 8==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Kent State shootings]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Chris Butler]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Kent_State_shootings|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Kent_State_shootings|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 14:04, 8 April 2013 (UTC)
