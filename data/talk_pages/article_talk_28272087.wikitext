The external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.  I removed the following link(s): http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-The-Turf/108414375881238&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bfacebook\.com) --&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.
