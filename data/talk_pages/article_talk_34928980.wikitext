[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG makes very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|mistakes]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been considered as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|959729}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
