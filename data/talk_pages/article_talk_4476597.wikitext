== Referencing of NSBHS notable alumni list ==

I have not yet received a reply to my email to the school requesting an alumni list. And as you have pointed out you cannot reference something unless it is publicly available, i.e. something someone can go to the library to have a look at. Reference value of a secretive list is equivalent to the reference value of my imagination.

Having looked for everyone on the list in ''Who's Who in Australia'' 1943, 1965 and 1985 and referencing them if they appear, and having looked in ''Monash Biographical Dictionary of 20th Century Australia''. I suggest the following: 1. Look in later Who's Who, one from the mid 90's and one from between 2000 and 2006, 2. Search the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' which is more comprehensive (and authoritative) than Who's Who and covers only deceased persons, 3. Place a 14 day ultimatum on all 'notable' Old Boys to be deleted who haven't by then had either a Wikipedia article or stub on them or a reference.

This last part will be controversial and seems like something an administrator should do and also facilitate a discussion for purposes of consensus, as the change is sort of equivilent to merging or deleting an article. But I do not know anything about Wiki policy regarding such matters. What are you thoughts? [[User:Grumpyyoungman01|Grumpyyoungman01]] 11:50, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[Mathura Krish]] ==

The article has been created again. This time there is a list of movies the person is supposed to have worked in. However, none of those movie pages on www.imdb.com has that name! Google search gives 2 results, both having nothing to do with anything written in the article. [[User:deeptrivia|deeptrivia]] ([[User talk:deeptrivia|talk]]) 12:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Interesting... ==

... I never knew that about Geoff Bullock, but figures from what I've seen/heard of HillSong. Feel sorry for Geoff Bullock (not sure if you realise this, but he is a very significant figure in Australian christian circles). Anyway, I agree: large slabs of text quoted are not really welcome, but the pasted quote (if it can be verified) IMO should be summarised and cited. - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 12:59, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion of Baba Yetu article ==

Baba Yetu is the title song to the computer game Civilization IV. Many people who play the game notice that it is an excellent song, but wonder as to what its saying, since it is sung in Swahili. The Baba Yetu page explained that the lyrics are based on 'The Lords Prayer' and showed both the english translation and the Swahili lyrics.

At the worst this page should have been moved to the Civilization IV page, but I don't understand why it would have been deleted. I would at least like a copy of the article if it cannot be undeleted, although i would like to 'challenge' its deletion if at all possible.

[[User:Sahuagin|Sahuagin]] 20:54, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
: It was deleted because it was reposted content that was deleted previously by concensus: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baba yetu]]. [[User:Enochlau|enochlau]] ([[User talk:Enochlau|talk]]) 10:19, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

:: why was it deleted if are there 6 votes to keep vs. 2 votes to delete at that link? could i at least have the article's text to copy to a different article, such as the Civilization IV article? like a few of the Keep votes say, many people wonder about the song, and look it up here, and learn about it, which is supposed to be the function of an encyclopedia.

== Page Deletion ==

24 Feb 2006 Why did you delete the page on Ralph McGehee the CIA critic? What does &quot;nn bio&quot; mean?

There are probably more articles belonging to this category. FYI, similar categories include, to name a few,  [[:category:national symbols of Canada]], [[:category:Scottish cultural icons]] and [[:category:Greek cultural icons]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:Instantnood|Insta]][[User_talk:Instantnood|ntnood]] 19:41, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
