I made some fixes to your edit on this article. You made some good corrections to errors, but in a couple of places made changes that did not agree with the referenced sources. If you think the sources were incorrect or biased, the best approach is to find other sources and add information from them to the article, with a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; pointer to them like the others in the article. A key principle of Wikipedia (and some of the content on this page flagged with {{fact}} does not meet it) is that all content should be backed up by reliable independent sources. I hope you will continue to contribute. [[User:Aymatth2|Aymatth2]] ([[User talk:Aymatth2|talk]]) 02:37, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Nigeria high commission in ghana]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;
A tag has been placed on [[:Nigeria high commission in ghana]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is a very short article providing no content to the reader. Please note that external links, &quot;See also&quot; section, book reference, category tag, template tag, interwiki link, rephrasing of the title, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article don't count as content. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. You may wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]].

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. If you plan to expand the article, you can request that [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] wait a while for you to add contextual material.  To do this, affix the template '''&lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt;''' to the page and state your intention on the article's [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Empty-warn --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background:#CC1010;color:#FFA0A0&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Blanchardb'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#A62428&quot;&gt;[[User:Blanchardb|Me]]•[[User Talk:Blanchardb|MyEars]]•[[Special:Contributions/Blanchardb|MyMouth]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;- timed 16:40, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

*I fixed the article, and the Speedy Deletion was declined. The key thing is to provide information with '''sources'''. [[User:Aymatth2|Aymatth2]] ([[User talk:Aymatth2|talk]]) 21:51, 15 February 2010 (UTC)
