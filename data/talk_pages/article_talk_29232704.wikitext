Varför ska det stå en hyllningstext om djurgårdens enda &quot;storhetstid&quot; direkt i början av artikeln? Detta framgår ju av avsnittet &quot;history&quot; och bör placeras där. Som det var innan var det en skrytinledning som är subjektiv och helt irrelevant.

[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. The &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djurg%c3%a5rdens_IF_Fotboll?diff=391276128 recent edit]&lt;/span&gt; you made to [[:Djurgårdens IF Fotboll]] has been reverted, as it appears to have removed content from the page without explanation. Use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for testing; if you believe the edit was constructive, please ensure that you provide an informative [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. You may also wish to read the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|introduction to editing]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-huggledelete1 --&gt; [[User:Diannaa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:teal;&quot;&gt;Diannaa&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Diannaa|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

[[File:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to blank out or remove portions of page content, templates or other materials from Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Djurgårdens IF Fotboll]], you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-delete3 --&gt; [[User:Tooga|Tooga]] - &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Tooga|BØRK!]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:18, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

{{unblock reviewed|1=I made constructive changes, but the user didn't listen. The article is appearantly biased, please block the user who requested to block me instead. |decline=I see you repeatedly removing a section of an article, with no explanation except a string of letters that make no sense in English.  Since you wouldn't stop or discuss your desired change, a block was necessary.  In the future, if you know others disagree with you, stop and discuss rather than trying to force a desired change into the encyclopedia by repeated reversion.
