[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalize]] Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Quetta]], you will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism3 --&gt; See [[Wikipedia:Editing policy]] for the rules.

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Shoaib.gif]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Shoaib.gif]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikipedia]] because of [[Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikipedia are [[open content]], [[public domain]], and [[fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.

==License tagging for Image:SHOAIB.GIF==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:SHOAIB.GIF]].  Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.  Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image.  This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
*[[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
*[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]].  If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 08:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== Adnan Aamir ==

Thank you for experimenting with Wikipedia by creating the page [[:Adnan Aamir]]. Your test worked, and has been or will soon be removed. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia.&lt;!-- Template:Testarticle-n (first level warning) --&gt;  See [[WP:BIO]].

== Shoaib images ==

Hello Primeboy,

Please don't upload commercial images to Wikipedia because we can't use them, even if they make the articles look better. Especially don't lie about the licence conditions (for example, tagging it as created by you) &amp;mdash; doing that can get you banned from editing.

Of course, we welcome other contributions from you.

Thanks,

[[User:Stephen Turner|Stephen Turner]] ([[User talk:Stephen Turner|Talk]]) 17:44, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Please do not recreate deleted articles ==

You have recently recreated or reposted material which previously was deleted in accordance with Wikipedia's [[WP:DP|deletion policies]]{{ #if: Adnan Aamir | &amp;nbsp;at [[:Adnan Aamir]]}}. Please do not recreate this article without prior approval from an [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrator]] or '''you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]]''' from editing. We ask that you respect [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|what Wikipedia is not]]. If you disagree with the article's deletion, you may seek an independent review [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Recreated --&gt; --[[user:ybbor|Ybbor]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User Talk:Ybbor|T]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Sarparah Qaumi Ittehad]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Sarparah Qaumi Ittehad]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G1|section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for any other experiments you would like to do. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Sarparah Qaumi Ittehad|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Sarparah Qaumi Ittehad|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nonsense-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Wifione|''&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue; text-shadow:silver 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em&quot;&gt;▒ Wirεłεşş ▒ Fidεłitұ ▒ Ćłâşş ▒ Θnε ▒&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Wifione|&lt;sub style=&quot;font-size: 60%&quot;&gt;―Œ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup style=&quot;margin-left:-3ex&quot;&gt; ♣Łεâvε Ξ мεşşâgε♣&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:42, 28 January 2010 (UTC)
