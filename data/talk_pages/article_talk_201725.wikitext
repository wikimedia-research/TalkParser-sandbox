{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:University of Toronto Mississauga/CCT110: The Rhetoric of Digital and Interactive Media Environments (S2014) | term = 2014 Q1 }} 
Hello, my name is Sara Ammari, I'm a student at University of Toronto and I will be adding to this page as part of my assignment.

==Improvement needed==
This article reads like a college essay (explainable  by notes above :-)). However it needs to be improved. I've added a note to the top and tried to break it into sections, but I don't know when I can get to working on it myself.
