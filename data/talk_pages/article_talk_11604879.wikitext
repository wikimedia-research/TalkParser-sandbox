[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:ImagineCover.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:ImagineCover.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;[[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 08:48, 5 June 2007 (UTC)


==Tricky Dicky==
The implication that the term &quot;Tricky Dicky&quot; for Nixon came from this song is misleading. The popular form of that nickname was &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;, and this precedes Lennon's song by about 21 years - back to the 1950 US Senate campaign in California (see http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mitchell-tricky.html?_r=1). Lennon's use of the term no doubt was influenced by this. It is possible this song contributed to its increased use in the early 1970s, but the Watergate scandal would no doubt have brought the use of this term back even without this song.

:There's little doubt Lennon wasn't just influenced by the nickname, but directly referencing Nixon. In 1971 everyone knew that Tricky Dicky meant Nixon. The nickname was used almost weekly on [[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.]] Jon Weiner used &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; as the title for his book on the Nixon/FBI campaign against Lennon.

==Pearl Jam 2003==
I made some changes to the reference to Pearl Jam's 2003 performances of the song. Pearl Jam started using the song in soundchecks in April 2003 on the US tour, shortly after the invasion of Iraq. It was a very political tour that featured Vedder using masks of Bush and occasionally Bill Gates, a lot of stage patter about free speech, and numerous references to &quot;the truth,&quot; as contrasted to the &quot;lies, lies, lies, lies&quot; condemned by the band in &quot;Bushleaguer.&quot; Vedder inserted some modified words that made &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; a direct comment on the war and Bush.

The previous editor's paraphrase of Vedder's comment about NYC/9/11 after the song was unreferenced, and so I substituted a more detailed and I believe more accurate quote taken directly from a fan site that tracks every concert. Without hearing Vedder's between-song patter, hard to say whether it related to &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot;. Note that it doesn't appear Vedder used the phrase &quot;9/11&quot; directly but by allusion.[[User:Popsup|Popsup]] ([[User talk:Popsup|talk]]) 22:16, 1 January 2013 (UTC)
