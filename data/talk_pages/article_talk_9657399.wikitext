== Naming Cleanup ==
Time to clean up this page some. Propose changing the name to SIMULIA, and setting up redirects. Perhaps even an outright merge with the [[Abaqus]] page? I'm not sure the SIMULIA needs  page, being just a brand. Abaqus (the product) certainly does, however. - [[User:EndingPop|EndingPop]] ([[User talk:EndingPop|talk]]) 16:41, 18 June 2008 (UTC)
