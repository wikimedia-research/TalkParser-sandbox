Writing an article for Wikipedia is harder than many people realize. Even professional writers find that the format and style needed for a good encyclopedia article are different than what might be appropriate for other venues. You could:
* '''Get someone else to do it'''—If your only goal is to make sure that an article is added to Wikipedia, you can [[WP:RA|request that someone write an article on the subject]].
* '''Start by editing other articles'''—If you are interested in becoming an editor at Wikipedia, our experience demonstrates that it is better to start by improving existing articles, which will help you get a sense of how this place works, and then you will be ready to write your first article from scratch. A good place to visit is [[WP:BL|the Wikipedia backlog]], where there are literally hundreds of thousands of articles needing help from editors. Find an article in a subject area you know, and add a source, or a reference, or simply help write it better.
* '''Go ahead and try'''—If you do decide to write an article immediately, please read [[WP:COI|our policy on conflicts of interest]], then read [[WP:FIRST|our guide to writing your first article]], which will repeat some of the good advice above. Then please use the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard 2.0|Article wizard]], which will help you through the steps. I urge you to accept the option to save your first draft in your [[Wikipedia:User page#How to create a user subpage|user subpage]], which will reduce the chance your work will be deleted before it is ready.
