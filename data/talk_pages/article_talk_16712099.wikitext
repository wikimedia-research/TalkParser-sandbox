== New concept? ==

Hi PLW,

Please explain your concept. What exactly is the benefit. How is adding blank images useful? [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 12:58, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
:I may have missed out on an edit summary but I did ask you here as to the benefit. As regards the concept, you have not bothered to explain it to me here as yet. I did see your changes to the other two posts and your edit summaries. Maybe what is obvious to you is not obvious to me. I'm not quite sure what you intend. So I asked here. Since my aim is not to get into a revert war, please explain what is your idea and why this is a good idea. If I'm convinced, I'll back you on it. [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 13:19, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::Well, now I understand what you are trying to do. I'm not convinced that this juxtaposition of images is meaningful but I will give you the benefit of my doubt. If you notice I immediately posted my query about your &quot;new concept&quot; on your talk page. Instead of giving my query in the edit summary, I did it on your talk page. As far as doing constructive things is concerned, it would have helped if you had explained in the talk page of the first article about your new concept itself what you did and why. It's not at all obvious. [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 13:37, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

== Renderings ==
:''This discussion has been put into context retrospectively, for archival purposes, hence Papa's conversation starter is here rather than on J Milburn's talk page, where it was posted originally.'' &lt;small&gt;(starter: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJ_Milburn&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=357052991&amp;oldid=356916001], ensuing correspondence: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJ_Milburn&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=357074679&amp;oldid=357052991] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJ_Milburn&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=357076799&amp;oldid=357076775] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:J_Milburn&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=357076799])&lt;/small&gt;


''[Addressing J Milburn]''  I'm a bit worried about your comment here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_picture_candidates%2FRQ-170_Sentinel&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=356953679&amp;oldid=356862993]. Do you mean to suggest that a labelled rendering would not be a diagram? Or not featurable? Thanks for clarifying. [[User:Papa Lima Whiskey|&lt;font color=&quot;#ba0000&quot;&gt;Papa Lima Whiskey&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Papa Lima Whiskey|talk]]) 19:43, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
:I'm obviously not making myself clear- all I am meaning to say is that a user-made illustration of this sort is not suitable to be used in place of a photo. Would we be featuring a user-made sketch of a building? No, but a floor-plan or something akin drawn by a Wikipedian would potentially be a suitable FP. Equally, a map would be suitable, a landscape painting not. See what I'm saying? [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 19:50, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::I still don't think I can agree with you. It seems that your problem (if we were to put it like that) is that you feel a 3D rendering is not as verifiable as a photograph or a diagram. But especially the parallel with a diagram shows the strength of a 3D modelling approach, because 3D models are unambiguously parameterised in their native file format. What that means is that while simple SVG diagrams that use a 3D perspective (or [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|user drawings]]) can easily be wrong, such errors are much more readily discoverable in a ''proper'' 3D model because the original file explicitly has the measurements - perspective in a simple SVG is usually guesswork unless the author has gone the particularly roundabout way of constructing the diagram using perspective lines rather than going for a 3D model for a start. As I said, since simple 3D raytracings can be readily converted to SVG (and SVG back to raster images), I see no rational basis for the rejection of rendered or raytraced images. In fact, we've promoted a limited number in the past although somewhat restricted to articles about 3D modelling. And I still think [[:File:RQ-170 Sentinel impression 3-view.png|this]] is no worse a starting point than a lot of diagrams that we eventually saw being promoted ([[Wikipedia:Featured_picture_candidates/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On|this one]] [[Wikipedia:Featured_picture_candidates/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On_2|took a bit longer]] and [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/File:Desargues_theorem.svg|so]] did [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/Anscombe's quartet|these]]). So I don't see how any of this is putting us at a disadvantage - if anything, having a spatial model is a plus! [[User:Papa Lima Whiskey|&lt;font color=&quot;#ba0000&quot;&gt;Papa Lima Whiskey&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Papa Lima Whiskey|talk]]) 21:34, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
:::I really think we're talking at cross-purposes here. We should strive to illustrate articles with photographs- obviously, however, as you say, in physics and mathematics articles, diagrams and renderings are more useful. Take the recent mosquito image- a diagram like that is highly useful; however, the [[:File:Culex sp..jpg|lead image]] still should be, and still is, a photograph. We should not aim to replace photographs with drawn pictures. [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 21:42, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::::Well, I don't think anyone is suggesting replacing a photograph because there isn't one. [[User:Papa Lima Whiskey|&lt;font color=&quot;#ba0000&quot;&gt;Papa Lima Whiskey&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Papa Lima Whiskey|talk]]) 21:46, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
:::::No, and my original point was that we should not be promoting user-made &quot;pseudo-photographs&quot;- instead, we should wait for photographs (or better photographs) to arrive. [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 21:51, 19 April 2010 (UTC)
::::::And no amount of armchair philosophising is going to produce the photograph. I predict it will be years before we get one that is suitably licensed, never mind the quality concerns. To me, this is purely a question of resolving whatever content concerns there may be about the computer rendering, not of barring certain kinds of media because of what to me still seems to amount to &quot;frankly, I don't like it&quot;. So my reply to your initial question, &quot;see what I'm saying?&quot; is, yes I can read the words but the meaning doesn't reveal itself.

:::::::Would you be happy to accept my painting of a certain landscape then, if I was a good enough painter? My sketch of a certain bird, if I was a good enough sketcher? [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 22:15, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

== Let's see... ==

How can I reply to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_picture_candidates%2Fdelist%2FCaribou_from_Wagon_Trails.jpg&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=357931061&amp;oldid=357850023 this] appropriately? I frankly have no idea what you're talking about. You have been raving about how I am opposed to the image appearing in the lead section, which, as I have explained, I am not. At the same time, this is completely consistent with me feeling that the EV is not high enough for the image to be featurable. If I have misunderstood, feel free to re-explain, but your sarcasm and the fact you're ignoring my comments just makes you look like an idiot.

Thanks for going through all the work on that one: If it helps,  find that spending a couple minutes preparing the list of everything I want to promote, with the creator and what it is, means I can just copy-paste the list and tweak the formatting at the various pages.

==Signpost==
Hey, PLW,

There's some boilerplate for this request, and I'll paste it below, but I prefer to be a bit more personal: I've gotten involved with helping out with the Signpost's new Features and admins section, which includes commentary and any interesting little bits that came up in the reviews for each of the content categories.

It also has a choice of the week, and that wanders amongst the regular contributors to FPC. There's about a dozen names that come to mind when I think about Featured pictures - I'll spare you a list, you've been there for years as well, and could come up with it just as easily. So, coming to the point: Would you like to be the person who selects their favourite Featured picture this week, to highlight in the signpost?  

''Boilerplate info follows''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Signpost's'' &quot;Features and admins&quot; page now includes a &quot;Choice of the week&quot; for featured articles, featured lists and featured pictures. Each week, ''The Signpost'' invites a different delegate, reviewer or nominator from each process to select what they think is the best, or their favourite, item, and to give their reasons. These reasons can be technical (e.g., related to the Criteria) or subjective, or both.

I wonder whether you'd be willing to judge the best featured [article/list/picture] in next week’s edition. If you agree, promotions from Monday 19 to Saturday 24 July will be eligible (only six days this week because the publication deadline has come forward). They will be listed [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2010-07-26/Features_and_admins|here]] by Saturday UTC, and we would need your text by Sunday UTC. Examples from previous weeks are accessible by clicking on &quot;← PREVIOUS ''Features and admins''&quot; at the bottom. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I realise the timing is a bit specific; obviously, it's because, well, too far in advance and we don't really know what will pass, too late and it's not really news. =)

If you can't do it this week, but want to do it later, just let me know when would be good. [[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:18, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

== Speedy closes, again ==

Do you not consider it a little... odd that you've just taken the liberty of speedy closing two nominations, neither of which actually meet any of the proposed guidelines? I completely agree with both closures, but I really, ''really'' can't see how this is consistent with the arguments you've expressed on the FPC talk page... [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 19:18, 21 July 2010 (UTC)
:Completely consistent, and they weren't speedy closes. One was withdrawn, and the other had its image file deleted. What else do you propose to do with them?

I just got the impression that you didn't... [[User:J Milburn|J Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 23:58, 21 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Speedy closes are those that invoke the speedy mechanism, i.e. where someone votes &quot;speedy close&quot;. This did not happen and was not necessary, these were entirely procedural closes.

:::::::Deleted files, withdrawn noms. Everything else that I can think of is less clear-cut: noms with licensing problems could be suspended if someone volunteers to attempt to acquire a more appropriate license; I believe everything that you've referred to as &quot;copyvio&quot; falls into this category. If nobody volunteers, these would also be closed &quot;procedurally&quot;, if it needs a name. I don't think we've said what the grace period for this would be, but I'm guessing somewhere between 24 and 48 hrs unless the nominator asks for immediate closure.

Well, it's certainly a ''[[Sepioteuthis]]'' and of the three commonly recognised species, ''S. lessoniana'' is the only one whose range covers [[Komodo National Park]] (see ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/ac479e/ac479e18.pdf for example).

:Regardless of my own actions (which I stand by...) you cannot just make up your own rules, ''especially'' when the nomination, if following the rules, will close the way you don't want it to. I explained why I did not notify Fir- he's not away, he's ''retired'', he's said he's not here any more. There was nothing under-hand about what I did, and I resent the insinuation.

::When someone retires from Wikipedia, they really can't expect to be notified.

I'm certainly not the only person (Muhammad, Adam) who has been more than a little surprised at the demand to notify people who no longer edit.

I see that you have decided to ask for a second opinion on the deletion of [[Senostoma]]. You are, of course, perfectly welcome to do this. However, tagging it for speedy deletion as &quot;an article that contains no content whatsoever&quot; when that was not the case until you removed its content, is not the way to go about it.

== FPC question ==

Hi Papa Lima Whiskey, I'm 0.25 vote short of support for my [[Wikipedia:Featured_picture_candidates#Carambola|Carambola]] composition, and the voting is closing soon. It has some strong support but not enough people are voting. I'm wondering if you could help put one of those boxes at the top to draw attention to more potential voters? I don't mind if it fails due to many people opposing, but it would be a shame to fail just because there are simple not enough votes. If it fails, can I submit it again at a later stage? What are the rules for that? As you are aware, I'm quite new at FPC. Thanks. – [[User:SMasters|S Masters]] ([[User talk:SMasters|talk]]) 01:09, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

::Deleted.

::Yes, I'd be happy to work on the articles, though I'm not sure there is much information available that I can access.  I will look and see what I can do, afraid it might not be much, :)

::Identifying all of Nick's images that are FP-worthy and placed in developed articles would take some effort, and then there is the placing and the article writing to do for the others.  I suppose several of us who have an interest in his work have probably been checking and considering the same files and duplicating efforts without realising it.  I noticed your fruits table, btw, it's a good idea; perhaps something similar could be put together for Nick's material—identifying what he's done that is eligible in terms of size, article placement, and quality, and then inviting nominators to pick from the list.  But who would do the table?  :)  Too much work for one, he's been quite prolific.  Better ideas?

&lt;big&gt;'''Dispute Resolution – ''Survey Invite'''''&lt;/big&gt;
----
Hello {{BASEPAGENAME}}. I am currently conducting a study on the dispute resolution processes on the English Wikipedia, in the hope that the results will help improve these processes in the future. Whether you have used dispute resolution a little or a lot, now we need to know about your experience. The survey takes around five minutes, and the information you provide will not be shared with third parties other than to assist in analyzing the results of the survey. No personally identifiable information will be released.
 
'''Please click [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBlN2RPQzljTFgySWg1bGFPZkVJcWc6MQ HERE] to participate.'''&lt;br&gt;
Many thanks in advance for your comments and thoughts.
----
&lt;small&gt;You are receiving this invitation because you have had some activity in dispute resolution over the past year. For more information, please see the associated [[meta:Research:Wikipedia Dispute Resolution|research page]]. &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:Steven Zhang|&lt;font color=&quot;#078330&quot;&gt;Steven&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Steven Zhang|&lt;font color=&quot;#2875b0&quot;&gt;Zhang&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[WP:DRP|&lt;font color=&quot;#d67f0f&quot;&gt;DR goes to Wikimania!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 01:21, 6 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
