== [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for deletion]] nomination of [[:Wormwood (The Acacia Strain album)]] ==

&lt;div class=&quot;floatleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot;&gt;[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|42px]]&lt;/div&gt;I have nominated [[Wormwood (The Acacia Strain album)]], an article that you created, for [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion]]. I do not think that this article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and have explained why at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wormwood (The Acacia Strain album)]]. Your opinions on the matter are welcome at that same discussion page; also, you are welcome to edit the article to address these concerns. Thank you for your time.{{-}}Please contact me if you're unsure why you received this message. &lt;!-- Template:AFDWarning --&gt; —[[User:Koavf|Justin (koavf)]]❤[[User talk:Koavf|T]]☮[[Special:Contributions/Koavf|C]]☺[[Special:Emailuser/Koavf|M]]☯ 15:11, 3 August 2010 (UTC)
