== Citation problems ==
Hey Anurag, I am having some problems with citation. If you can please search &quot;for wg14/n693&quot; on Google and click on the first link that appears, you will notice that it is .pdf format file. It is an &quot;Editorial Review Draft&quot;. How do I cite this: as a book or as a journal or how exactly to cite this reference. My topic is [[tgmath.h]]. You can see the section &quot;Type-generic Macros&quot; to see why I want to cite this. Also, as this is a .pdf format file, please tell me which address to provide in the citation tab.&lt;br /&gt;

Just read your mail regarding writing on sandbox. Does this mean people(our students) who write/edit responsibly on Wikipedia should refrain from writing on Mainspace and should write on Sandbox only? Please clarify.&lt;br /&gt; [[User:Jobin RV|Jobin]] ([[User talk:Jobin RV|talk]]) 19:21, 13 October 2011 (UTC)

== What can you do about copyvio? ==

Please take a look at [[Wikipedia talk:India Education Program/Courses/Fall 2011/Computer Organization and Advanced Microprocessing]] and give us an indication what you can do as the ambassador to fix the problem.
