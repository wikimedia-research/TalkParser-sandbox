'''Welcome'''

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]]{{#if:{{{art|}}}|, especially what you did for [[{{{art}}}]]|}}. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are a few good links for newcomers:

* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

Here are some other hints and tips:

* I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits of having a username]].  (If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you instead.)
* When using [[Wikipedia:talk pages|talk pages]], please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~&amp;#126;~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Where to ask a question]], ask me on {{#if:{{{1|}}}|[[user talk:{{{1}}}|my talk page]]|my Talk page}}, or type '''&lt;nowiki&gt; {{helpme}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]].&lt;!-- Template:welcome-anon --&gt; [[User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea|Mermaid from the Baltic Sea]] 23:33, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
