I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/122.221.255.186|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;—the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John%20Bennet%20%28preacher%29&amp;diff=630062507 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:John Bennet (preacher)]]— because it didn’t appear constructive to me.
