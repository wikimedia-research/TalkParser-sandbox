== Welcome to Wikipedia!  ==

Hello and welcome, Kathchown! I see you share an interest in Annerley with me (I grew up there and attended Junction Park State School). I hope you will keep on contributing to Wikipedia! I know it can be a bit hard to get started with Wikipedia sometimes, so, if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask me. You can either write to me here on your talk page (I'll watch it) or on [[User talk:Kerry Raymond|my talk page]] or email me on kerry.raymond@wikimedia.org.au [[User:Kerry Raymond|Kerry]] ([[User talk:Kerry Raymond|talk]]) 12:51, 11 December 2013 (UTC)
