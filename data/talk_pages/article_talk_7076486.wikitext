== Domo artigat≈ç gozaimasu ^_^ ==

It's nice to know that my edits have not gone unnoticed. :) I think I plan on working on fixing up (and making stubs for) a variety of visual novel articles in the future. It is certainly an aspect that doesn't get much focus. Actually, I'm happy to work on any article, but I don't like working on them when I don't have all of the knowledge of the series. Which is where working on some of ''Shuffle!'''s related articles gets to be a problem. I haven't played ''[[Tick! Tack!]]'' or ''[[Really? Really!]]'' so I need something else to focus on for now. On a related note, I see you've been working on ''[[Xenogears]]''. Have you played the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' games too? I ask because I just bought the ''Xenogears I &amp; II'' DS version and I'm wondering how they are. Completely different from the PS2 game of course, but still would like to hear opinions on the series itself. So anways, now I'm stuck again without a real article to focus on. Dunno what to do... --[[User:SeizureDog|SeizureDog]] 08:06, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

Of course it won't go unnoticed, not on a KC member's sight! ;) Unfortunately, I haven't played the Xenosaga series, I only took the captions from the [[EPSXE]] cuz my PS1 has been dead for about 3 years and my PCs not that great to fully utilize the GFXs of Xenosaga. You're saying you haven't played Tick Tack and Really? Really? ? Then where'd you get some captions of it? I just wanna know... Oh, and I'll be uploading more of the captions from Xenogears I have to the Xeno sections when I have the time. [[User:Pathbinder|Pathbinder]] 11:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned fair use image (Image:Anime-poster.jpg)==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Anime-poster.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, the image is currently [[WP:O|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see [[Wikipedia:Fair use#Policy|our fair use policy]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box.

==License tagging for Image:Easter egg.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Easter egg.jpg]]. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
* [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
* [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]]. If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 12:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Xenogears ==

Sorry to intrude. I noticed you uploaded [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Weltall-id_ygdrassil.jpg this screencap]. I'm curious -- have you seen End of Evangelion, and if so, have you noted the similarities (and I use the term lightly) between Eva 02 throwing the destroyer and Id throwing the Yggdrasil? Just curious about your thoughts on this, as the [[Xenogears]] article at one time stated (without citation) that the creators of the game vehemently denied taking inspiration from Eva. While many similarities in the game exist, this to me was a direct attempt to duplicate, to the greatest possible degree, that scene from Eva. Since you took a screencap of this, I'm assuming you remember this part of the game as vividly as I do, so I'd love to get your thoughts on this. Best regards. -[[User:Etafly|Etafly]] ([[User talk:Etafly|talk]]) 02:19, 29 December 2007 (UTC)
