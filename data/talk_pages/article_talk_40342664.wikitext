Hello, I am the uploader and an employee of Saint Michael's College, I can confirm that this is our photograph. What do I need to do to get this problem fixed? Thanks. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:MikeDKnight|MikeDKnight]] ([[User talk:MikeDKnight|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/MikeDKnight|contribs]]) 12:34, 26 August 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Excellent. If you can license the image, we can keep it. It would be best to authenticate your ownership and copyright on [[Wikimedia Commons]] (unless you wish to restrict its use to the English Wikipedia). Follow the instructions [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OTRS here]. I have marked the image as OTRS-pending which might stop the en.wiki copy from being deleted.
