A tag has been placed on [[CLSR]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is a very short article that does not provide sufficient context to identify its subject. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. 

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. If you plan to expand the article, you can request that [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] wait a while for you to add contextual material.  To do this, affix the template '''{{tlx|hang on}}''' to the article and state your intention on the article's [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Empty-warn --&gt; [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] ([[User talk:ArglebargleIV|talk]]) 14:22, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
