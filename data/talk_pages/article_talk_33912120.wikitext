== Your submission at [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]] ==
[[File:Citaton-needed-vertical.svg|150px|right|link=Wikipedia:Citing sources]]

I noticed your submission in [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]], '''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/The Yangon Directory]]'''.  Thanks! It will be reviewed by a volunteer soon.

Before it can be added to Wikipedia, your submission should have references.  All articles on Wikipedia should have inline, numbered references after facts, showing the 'reliable source' (a newspaper, book, etc.) where the information can be checked, so that all information is [[WP:V|verifiable]].
[[File:Citing_sources_tutorial,_part_1.ogv|right|thumb|Here's a video tutorial - hit play, then right-click for &quot;full screen&quot;.]]

Here's an example of how to add references:
&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot; style=&quot;background:#def; border:1px solid #468; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em auto; background-color:#EBFFEB;&quot;&gt;Chzz is 98 years old.&amp;lt;ref&gt; &quot;The book of Chzz&quot;, Aardvark Books, 2009. &amp;lt;/ref&gt;

He likes tea.&amp;lt;ref&gt; Smith, John. &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://foonews.com/Article42 Interview with Chzz]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Foo News, 1 April 2010. Retrieved 2011-05-22.  &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;== References ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That makes the references automatically display as small numbers&lt;sup&gt;[{{colour|blue|1}}]&lt;/sup&gt; which will link to the details in the section titled == References == at the end.  You can [[User:ChzzBot IV/Example page with references|see that example in action here]].

Please add references to your submission, which will be reviewed as soon as possible. See also, [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]]. If you need any help, just put {{tn|helpme}} at the end of ''this'' page, followed by a question or get into our live help chat chanel at {{IRC|wikipedia-en-help}}.
