In the section &quot;Members&quot; the band members' years of birth are not mentioned.

e.g. &quot;Adam James Pitts born on 24 December in Brighton&quot; etc.

Is there a reason for this?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.98.194.214|2.98.194.214]] ([[User talk:2.98.194.214|talk]]) 01:19, 10 November 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
