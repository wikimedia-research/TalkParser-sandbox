[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Ricchar]], did not appear to be constructive and has been reverted. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- {{Uw-vandalism1|Ricchar}} --&gt;

I have deleted [[Ricchar]] as vandalism.  If you can write an article about him that is based on the truth and the references then it could be acceptable.
