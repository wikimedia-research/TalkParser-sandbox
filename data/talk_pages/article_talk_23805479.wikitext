Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help.

== Masis Voskanyan ==

Please introduce a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] so we can [[WP:V|verify]] the information you are adding about this [[WP:BLP|living person]]. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 11:31, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

[https://translate.google.am/#hy/en/%D5%A8 This one] if it's good enough. Also check out the ('''Не''') [[Armenian alphabet]]. My god it's like keep telling yourself that the sky is red, when it's blue. It's hard for me to find English sources about that. I'll keep searching though. I could provide you with billions of Armenian grammar sources, but I don't think it would help you. --Narek75archives 11:54, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:Well seeing as we have had [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masis_Voskanyan&amp;diff=606001431&amp;oldid=601807213 two possible spellings] we need a source to confirm which the correct one is. Any Armenian-language sources about this person, we can use the spelling from that. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 12:21, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

Wow I actually did find one. Here please: [http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/masis-voskanian/profil/spieler_74542.html Masis Voskanian]. [[User:Narek75|Narek75]]
:Transfermarkt is not a reliable source. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 12:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

Go watch other language Wikis. I'M DONE !
