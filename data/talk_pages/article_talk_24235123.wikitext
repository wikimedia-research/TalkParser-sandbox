==Pointless==
This is pointless. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:76.19.82.104|76.19.82.104]] ([[User talk:76.19.82.104|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/76.19.82.104|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

I second that; this list needs pruning! [[User:Punkmorten|Punkmorten]] ([[User talk:Punkmorten|talk]]) 21:17, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

==Under Construction==

Hello, this is [[User:Nezzadar|Nezzadar]]. Right now, I am working on cleaning up this list, and have made some progress. When I am done, there will be no need for this page and I will ask for it to be deleted. 

===The Plan===

1. Seperate &quot;Faculty&quot; section off, create a new page for faculty, transpose the names, create a link to the new page from this page and the Northeastrn Univesity page.
:::'''Done''' ''See [[Notable Northeastern University Faculty]]''
2. Massive clean up of the new Faculty page.
:::'''Done'''
3. Massive clean up of the alumni list, which is all that remains on the page &quot;List of Northeastern University People&quot;
:::'''Good Enough for Now'''
4. Create a new page for alumni, transpose the names, create a link to the new page from this page and the Northeasten University page.
:::'''Done''' ''I'm glad that I remembered the [[WP:MOVE]] function. Makes it easy.''
5. Remove all links to this page, sub in a link to the appropriate new page, then delete old page.
:::'''Done''' ''List of Northeastern University people is pending deletion.''

===Helping===

I do not own this page, however I would greatly appreciate it if you would notify me of any major changes you make, you can do it here if you want. This is mainly so I can keep track of what has been and what needs to be done. I generally won't touch your changes, but if I do, it will be to create a visual consistency (capitalize the first letter after the dash, etc)

I believe in good faith editing, and do not fact check the names. So far I have checked a few people to get information for their summeries, and have found my faith not misplaced. Please do not add in phony names. 

===Thank You===

== Talk Section ==
*Redirects are left intentionally behind after a move and in this case here not subject to speedy deletion per CSd R3. In general we also do not use 'notable' in the titles, because it is understood that only notable people are listed. So this list has too many redlinks and is now named differently than others in [[:Category:Lists of people by university in the United States]].--[[User:Tikiwont|Tikiwont]] ([[User talk:Tikiwont|talk]]) 23:37, 5 September 2009 (UTC)
: So I've moved it to [[List of Northeastern University alumni]] to comply with our general naming convention with no caps for alumni.--[[User:Tikiwont|Tikiwont]] ([[User talk:Tikiwont|talk]]) 06:11, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

== Redlinks ==

A list article like this should only have people who have articles of their own per [[WP:REDDEAL]] (last bullet in the section). All of the redlinks should be deleted; I'll do it in a few days unless someone has a reason I shouldn't. --[[User:JaGa|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;Ja&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;Ga&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]][[User_talk:JaGa|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 04:02, 23 January 2011 (UTC)
