== Mary Reed Bobbitt (1960) With Dearest Love to All The Life and Letters of Lady Jebb ==

Lady Jebb was not cremated in Erie. The woman from the Erie Cemetery Association indicated they did not have a crematorium in Erie until the 1950s. Her body was transported to Buffalo (as documented in one of her obituaries) to be cremated there; her ashes were interred in Cambridge.
