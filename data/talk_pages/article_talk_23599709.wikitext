==List of eurypterids==
Your work on the [[List of eurypterids]] has been a ''fantastic'' addition. If you were a registered member I'd have given you a barnstar. Another way you could help us would be to add the species information you added to the list to the articles on individual genera. I got the first quarter or so of them done, but lost track of what genera I had added your species data to and then got discouraged and gave up. Thank you very much for contributing! And some members want to ban IPs from editing! Thank God they haven't gotten their way. [[User:Abyssal|Abyssal]] ([[User talk:Abyssal|talk]]) 03:04, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
