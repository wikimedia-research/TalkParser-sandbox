== Raising on a shield ==

I've found a citation in the ''International Journal of the Classical Tradition'' an article called &quot;Raising on a Shield: Origin and Afterlife of a Coronation Ceremony&quot; by Hans Teitler.  The abstract states:  &quot;This article deals with 'raising on a shield' both as a historical phenomenon and as subject of artistic representation. Originally Germanic, the ritual is for the first time attested in Tacitus, in a passage about Brinno, the chief of the Cananefates who cooperated with &quot;Claudius&quot; Civilis during the Batavian revolt. ''Next comes Julian, nicknamed the Apostate, who, raised on a shield by his Gallic and Germanic soldiers, was the first Roman emperor to undergo this ritual, witness Ammianus Marcellinus and Libanius. After Julian, the 'raising on a shield' soon became part and parcel of the Byzantine coronation ceremony'' (literary sources and illustrations in mediaeval manuscripts testify to its existence), but the ritual is also attested for Ostrogoths and Franks--the depiction of the raising on a shield of Frankish kings by Gregory of Tours would seem to be the ultimate source of inspiration for French medallists and cartoonists. Tacitus' Brinno is more than once raised on a shield by Dutch painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth century.&quot;
Seems relevant to the article to me.  [[User:L Hamm|L Hamm]] 21:42, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

==It's not all religion==
The article seems a little unbalanced at the moment with a large percentage being given over to Julian vs. Christianity and much less to all the other events of his life. Could someone who knows about this stuff add some more detail about his rise to power, rule in Gaul, the defeat of Constantius, his reforms, opinions, etc. --[[User:Spondoolicks|Spondoolicks]] 16:18, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
:You are so right! The article reads as a pagan catachismus, while we are talking about a military politician.Where's the military? Where is the politics? [[User:Johanthon|johanthon]] 10:34, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

==Page name is POV==

&quot;Christian sources commonly refer to him as Julian the Apostate...&quot; It says so in the article and it is as plain as that; ''Christian'' sources name him so. Arguments that &quot;he is known that way&quot; simply beg the question. Has anyone actually surveyed history texts in many world languages, for example? I have read the archived discussion and nothing I see there refutes the notion that the title is POV. It may be old POV, but it is still POV, regardless. [[User:Whogue|Whogue]] 00:54, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
:So what? Every historical account has a bias and thus reflects some POV. This is hardly an excuse to stop using historical accounts nor is it a point against using historical labels such as 'apostate'. Christianity is our European heritage - even if we don't like it. We can't escape the christian heritage and we should not try it, because the christian bias is informative in its own way, especially for this article.
:Please, remember this is an encyclopedia and people need to find articles easily. The most common name for this article is 'Julian the apostate'. Nobody, not even specialists, will try to look it up under his real name. I hope there is no need to explain that Wikipedia is not a place for pagan (or atheïst) revisionism. And the poll above here is clear. [[User:Johanthon|johanthon]] 10:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC) (an uncurable atheïst).
::I didn't realize that ''Christian'' POV is acceptable, or that Wikipedia is meant to be used primarily by Christians. All I see is a good case for a redirect at &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; pointing here. Take a look at [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/NumisWiki/view.asp?key=Julian%20II the Numiswiki entry for Julian II]: &quot;Julianus II, Julianus (Flavius Claudius) [Julian II], usually called Julian the Apostate,...&quot; This is from the 1889 &quot;Dictionary of Roman Coins, which nicely puts to bed the notion that &quot;specialists&quot; expect to find the entry under &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; or that indexing him under &quot;Julian II&quot; is somehow &quot;pagan revisionism&quot;; the Numiswiki editors point out that the authour of the Julian II article &quot;... is very much biased against anything not Christian.&quot; Thyou were repeatedly wrone Japanese Wikipedia article is titled &quot;ユリアヌス&quot; (Julianus) - the Russian Wikipedia article is &quot;Флавий Юлиан&quot; (Flavius Julius). In short, there is no real reason to persist with a POV name when simply using his real name is commonly done and is the norm even in other language Wikipedias.

::Pointing at other projects' and languages' policies is a total red herring.  Our own policy is to use ''the most common name in English''.  There is no question but that the most common name in English is &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot;.

:::Just a note: the original title of this section was &quot;Page name is POV&quot;, as Whogue wrote it; shouldn't it be left that way? Codex Sinaiticus is absolutely right about policy: see [[WP:NAME]]. The ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' lists our man as '''Julian''' 'the Apostate' '''(Iulianus''' ('''RE''' 26), '''Flavius Claudius),''' confirming that many experts do expect to find him under this name, as the titles of the articles &amp; books listed under &quot;secondary sources&quot; confirms. I really wish that people would stop focusing on this supposed &quot;POV&quot; issue, which I find to be very trivial, and concentrate on improving the content of the article. [[User:Akhilleus|--Akhilleus]] ([[User talk:Akhilleus|talk]]) 16:36, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
I just looked in my university catalogue: &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; like &quot;Philip the Arab&quot;  are only found as book titles. The Library of Congress subject heading is: 
 Julian, Emperor of Rome, 331-363, 
 Philip, the Arabian, Emperor of Rome, 244-249

The Wiki one hope aspires to be content neutral. And speaking as a person of European Jewish origin, I find the reference to Christian majoritism offensive. I am not PC, I am, have been, always will be a minority. And as the 3rd Reich proved, words have tremendous power. I ask the editors to follow a neutral policy.

:Previous discussion included a poll on moving to &quot;Julian&quot;. A careful read of the comments shows that many &quot;oppose&quot; voters felt that &quot;Julian&quot; was not specific enough. Indeed, He was &quot;Julian II&quot; not &quot;Julian&quot; so the proposed move would not have been accurate. After reading the comments on the previous polls it is clear that many were not happy with the present name, but the proposed alternative was not acceptable either. Several good alternatives were proposed. Let's take a look at them. The fellow had a name (Flavius Claudius Julianus) and a simple designation exists in the line of emperors (Julian II) and I simply think we should use one of those as the title. &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; can redirect here. Otherwise I don't see why we don't move &quot;Richard M. Nixon&quot; to &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;; after all, that's what most people called him.

::Thanks for moving my sig. But as for the article title, it doesn't matter whether editors are happy with the name or not.

In contrast, Richard Nixon is not usually known as &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;--it's a common nickname, yes, but not nearly as common a way to refer to him as &quot;Richard Nixon&quot; or &quot;Richard M.

:::I agree that the question is whether &quot;the subject of this article is most commonly known as &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; in expert sources&quot;, and there are are some examples of that, but there are counter examples as well. Gibbon doesn't use &quot;J the A&quot;, for example, and the numismatics text I cited don't either. My examples from other wikis were just meant to show that we can't claim he is ''universally'' known as &quot;J the A&quot; and those other wikis were at hand, so to speak. The coin in the article shows him as &quot;Fl Cl Julianus&quot;, and that is the way coin people know him. I guess I'm just not willing to give &quot;J the A&quot; a slam dunk as &quot;universal&quot;, or even &quot;most common by experts&quot;. Further study is needed, and I hope we can take a close look at the comments in the archived discussion.

::Whogue, numismatics are a very rare minority, even amongst historians. They use labels related to their coins. Those coins are produced by Julian himself and obviously he didn't call himself 'apostate'. The majority of people will not be interested in his coins, but in his policy. This is related to the struggle between pagans and christians. The current tittle is very helpfull to point at just that, and it helps the more clever people in understanding how christian propaganda really worked. This is informative in its own right and that is what an Encyclopedia is about: finding information easily under well known informative labels.
::BTW Julian was never called Julian in late antiques. He was called Iulianus. The J in his name comes from Christian-Carolingian churchscript. How come you don't protest against that?

:::As others have pointed out, there is a lot more to Julian II than that particular issue. The current &quot;tittle&quot; may be &quot;helpfull&quot;, but if you want an article about any kind of propaganda then it should be that, an article.

:My two cents:
:* In the ''text'' of any article a person should be refered to in a formal, respectful way and generally introduced by their formal title. This article does that but I have seen some others that refer to Julian as &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; which is inappropriate unless it is done in an &quot;a.k.a.&quot; sort of description.
:* IMHO article titles do no have to be quite so formal and in fact it is acceptable to use a title that reflects how a person or thing is commonly known (i.e. commonly known today, not necessarily during their lifetime or some other period in history). The title may reflect one thing that a person or thing is most known for even it if oversimplifies them. However, in an encyclopedic context a title should not be misleading or deliberately slanderous. If the the most common name for someone is reflects unreasonable POV by some group then a more neutral name should be selected even if it is less common.
:* Ideally Wikipedia should have a uniform policy on titling historical articles. In particular it would be nice to have a uniform policy for titles for historical leaders like this. I'm not aware that such a policy has ever been proposed. Is there a forum where this would be appropriate to discuss?
:This particular one is debatable but, as common as the &quot;Apostate&quot; monicker is, I still tend to think it is too loaded with POV to be an appropriate as a title. If, for example, &quot;Hilter the Crazy&quot; had become popular I would still argue that this is too loaded to be used even if I happen to agree with the characterization. In the abscence of a standard I'd say the title &quot;Julian II&quot; is appropriate if less recognized.
:--[[User:Mcorazao|Mcorazao]] 20:17, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

Just a quick comment. It is not true that he was called IULIANUS - though this ludicrous spelling pops up even in published works. He spelt his name IVLIANVS. Vocalised I as well V were later added. Unless you are prepared talk about Ivlivs Caesar and Avgvstvs you should write the name Julianus (or Julian).

Neither is he Julian II - this is just a numismatic moniker that means he was the second Julian whose coins are sorted under that name. Julian I is the obscure usurper Julian of Pannonia, not Didius Julianus, who briefly was a &quot;proper&quot; Roman emperor but is referred to under his full name. Julian is Julian I.

I am an admirer of Julian but don't object to his nickname. It is common, and he did defect from Christianity. Whether in a bad way or not is up to the beholder. Caligula is found under that name, even though it means &quot;Little boot&quot; and is by no means worthy of an emperor. [[User:Sponsianus|Sponsianus]] 21:51, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

I think this has a pretty easy answer, we need just ask ourselves &quot;Would Julian like to be known as Julian the Apostate?&quot; I think the answer would be no, and I don't think there will be any argument. Sponsianus says his proper name is Julian_I, and name which is not already taken. Julian_the_Apostate should redirect there. No, I do not know how to do this move myself. [[User:JoshNarins|JoshNarins]] ([[User talk:JoshNarins|talk]]) 17:34, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

I agree with what Sponsianus wrote above. Julian ''was'' an [[Apostasy|apostate]] of Christianity — far from being offended, he would have gladly embraced the epithet.

Many of these arguments about not offending poor old dead Julian seem reasonable, until one remembers the nicknames that many medieval kings had: [[Charles the Bald]], [[Charles the Fat]], [[Joanna of Castile|Juana the Mad]]... I don't see anyone complaining about these. Is it because the potential &quot;offended&quot; happen to be Christian? [[User:FilipeS|FilipeS]] ([[User talk:FilipeS|talk]]) 22:22, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

: In those cases that is what they were known at the time, Charles the Bald knew himself as Charles the Bald. Julian did not know himself, nor was he called, Julian the Apostate at the time. Christians aren't offended by calling him Apostate, it is what they call him. He did not call himself that, and no one at the time called him that. Certainly [[Ivan_IV_of_Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] should be a good example. His wikipedia entry comes under Ivan IV of Russia. Julian was Julian I of the Roman Empire, and it is only through the Christian lens that anyone can call him Apostate. Actually, from what I read of him in Ammanius Marcellinus and other sources, he was a really good guy who happened to prefer philosophy to Christianity.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JoshNarins|JoshNarins]] ([[User talk:JoshNarins|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JoshNarins|contribs]]) 21:02, 23 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

This argument seems to have drifted away from the relevant policy, [[WP:NAME]], which tells us that page titles should be whatever the subject is most commonly called in English. &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; is the most common way of referring to this person in English, so that's the page title. If you want to change the page name, please demonstrate that another name is more common. Now, let me repeat something I've said before on this page: I really wish that people would stop focusing on this supposed &quot;POV&quot; issue, which I find to be very trivial, and concentrate on improving the content of the article. [[User:Akhilleus|--Akhilleus]] ([[User talk:Akhilleus|talk]]) 21:36, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

: I do not find it trivial at all. I take offense when a great person is commonly known by a bad name. It is, without a doubt, a name with violates NPOV and is common. Ivan the Terrible is the common name for Ivan IV of Russia, but the wiki article is Ivan IV. No one is going to try to tell me that Ivan the Terrible isn't the more well known name. You are being insulting by calling it a &quot;supposed&quot; POV issue, since it certainly does respect POV with respect to the person himself, and to non-Christians over the world (which are the majority, even if not the majority of English speakers). I can not demonstrate that another name is more common. What is the common name for homosexuals in America today? I won't sully this thread by mentioning it, by you can bet your bottom dollar (ooh, bad pun) that the wikipedia article isn't named that. Sometimes ?maybe even most of the time? common wisdom is wrong. Julian is &lt;b&gt;only an apostate if you are a Christian&lt;/b&gt;, he is a leader, both the Constantine before and the Constantius after were psychotics by comparison (not for their position on the Christian faith, mind you, just in general). Perhaps I think you are forgetting that what is &quot;popular&quot; is usually defined by the people who have the loudest voice, who can pay for the most press, the victors who get to write history? It is popularly believed in America that the US spends 25% of its budget on foreign aid, and that ghosts exist.

It says the statue is a 18th-century copy of a Roman original from 120-130 CE representing a priest of Sarapis. Proffered arguments are: the character wears a beard, a sacerdotal crown and a pallium; rendition of eyes and hair place the statue in the Hadrian era.

OK, I've scanned the archives as well as this discussion, and haven't seen this (obvious?) point noted:

The article on [[Jesus]] isn't titled, &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;; &quot;Jesus, Son of God&quot;; or &quot;Jesus, Lord and Savior&quot;; even though He is commonly known by these (and other titles) among Christians. If the article on Jesus isn't titled by the way Christians refer to Him, why is the article on Julian titled by the way Christians refer to him?

For that matter, I notice that the article on [[Jimmy Wales]] isn't titled &quot;Jimbo&quot;, even though he's known that way among Wikipedians. Strange. [[User:Unimaginative Username|Unimaginative Username]] 01:11, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

== Julian's religious status POV ==
It's odd that the article states &quot;Julian's religious status is a matter of considerable dispute.&quot; And then proceeds to state that &quot;He did not practice normative civic Roman cult of the earlier empire, but a kind of esoteric approach to classical philosophy sometimes identified as theurgy and also neoplatonism.&quot; You see, THAT is part of the dispute - so it should not be stated as a fact! The most thorough modern biography of Julian is Rowland Smith's &quot;Julian's Gods&quot; - and much of that book is devoted to taking issue with those who have portrayed Julian's religiosity as being &quot;at odds with the assumptions and practices of 'mainstream' Graeco-Roman polytheism.&quot; (p. xiv). Obviously that paragraph requires rewording to not only state THAT a disagreement exists, but WHAT the disagreement consists of. [[User:Durruti36|Durruti36]] 21:44, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

:Why don't you try to find a new phrase? &quot;Be bold.&quot; You have a point on the dispute-thing. Allthoug I would like to point out that the current phrase might constitute another problem, for &quot;civic Roman cult&quot; (like for example the cult of the god Silvanus), is something completely different than the 'Religion of State', with rites for Jove, Janus, Mars .....

::Bowersock's &quot;biography&quot; is essentially an extended exercise in character assassination. Bowersock is a great historian and an excellent writer - but he's got a serious fixation on &quot;bringing down&quot; Julian - which, apparently, he has had ever since Gore Vidal's novel came out 45 years ago. For a much different, and far more balanced, approach check out Rowland Smith's &quot;Julian's Gods&quot;, reviewed here: http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1997/97.03.22.html .

==The War against the Persians==
The article states that Julian's aim for the War was to retake cities lost by Constantius. I think an important point is missed by failing to add that Julian's goal was actually a much higher one, namely to attack Ctesiphon and (according to some authors) replace Shapur with another king. I don't currently have acces to the sources about the Shapur-replacement but I think that Ctesiphon as the goal for his war should be added, rather than saying that he merely wanted to retake lands lost by his predecessor. That implies that he either
*ended up there by mistake
*or took Ctesiphon to be land lost by Constantius

Whoever inappropriately added &quot;this is garbled&quot; at the end of the quote, please explain why. Apart from a few typos (which are now corrected), and the omission of two sentences in the middle of the phrase, the quote is not distorted. I omitted the aforementioned phrases because I *think* they don't add to author's analysis while they would make the quoted text excessively long. Perhaps I'm wrong. Judge by yourself from the full text below (the sentences I omitted are shown as bold) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They expected a man who was both removed from them by the awesome spectacle of imperial power, and would validate their interests and desires by sharing them from his Olympian height. '''The ascetic was supposed to be detached from the world, to derive his power in the temporal world from the fact of this separation. The emperor derived his legitimacy from his ability to exercise power at the heart of the temporal construct of power relationships.''' He was supposed to be interested in what interested his people, and he was supposed to be dignified. He was not supposed to leap up and show his appreciation for a panegyric that it was delivered, as Julian had done on January 3, when Libanius was speaking, and ignore the chariot races&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ye gods, folks, this issue has been discussed to death, and there's never been any consensus to move this page from the title &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot;. [[Ivan the Terrible]] isn't a great comparison, because there's a whole set of guidelines about how to refer to European rulers. In the absence of such guidelines for Roman Emperors, we stick with the basic policy--the most common name in English. That's Julian the Apostate, and there's plenty of evidence cited for this already--including the form of the entry in the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', which is a perfectly respectable source to follow.

*'''Oppose'''. Our policy on article names, [[WP:NAME]], tells us to use the most commonly used name in English. For this subject, &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; is a much more common name than &quot;Flavius Claudius Iulianus&quot;. A simple Google Scholar search demonstrates this: [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=julian+the+apostate Julian the Apostate] gets approximately 4,420 results, [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=flavius+claudius+iulianus Flavius Claudius Iulianus] gets 141. Of course, this is because our man's full name would usually be transliterated Flavius Claudius '''Julianus'''; this gets [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=flavius+claudius+julianus&amp;btnG=Search 568 results]. These searches of scholarly literature demonstrate what should already be evident from the format of the entry in the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' (a standard reference work dealing with the classical world): '''Julian''' 'the Apostate' '''(Iulianus''' ('''RE''' 26), '''Flavius Claudius)'''. In classical scholarship, Julian the Apostate is the most common way of referring to this emperor.
::And, I make this point every time this discussion comes up, so let me say it again: the [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy does not mean &quot;Wikipedia articles shouldn't offend me.&quot; It means that Wikipedia articles are supposed to represent all significant published points of view, in proportion the the prominence of each. For historical subjects, the best sources to turn to are academic literature published in the appropriate field--in this case, ancient history and classical studies. As the Google Scholar searches demonstrate, scholars in those fields use the name &quot;Julian the Apostate.&quot; [[User:Akhilleus|--Akhilleus]] ([[User talk:Akhilleus|talk]]) 04:17, 30 January 2008 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. While I understand that [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ancient Romans)]] exists, I think it's a poor system that needs to be changed and that this case is a prime example why. I have no idea why we're not using simply ''Flavius Claudius Iulianus'' since it's his name. Even ''Julian II'' would be better rather than this obviously problematic article title. We should have some sort of convention in place that simply uses the emperor's name and not some sort of skewed angle where we simply go with the less-than-favorable Christian description as article title just because it's not as well known and, obviously, the legacy regarding this emperor is going to be less than shiny considering the outcome of the Christianization of the Roman Emperor. Other examples of European rulers, such as [[Ivan IV of Russia]] (Most commonly known as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; in English) have equaled similar conventions. I think observing [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)]] would be far more appropriate as it would even technically place this under its scope. [[User:Bloodofox|:bloodofox:]] ([[User talk:Bloodofox|talk]]) 06:24, 30 January 2008 (UTC)
::[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)]] says &quot;''Most general rule overall:'' use the '''most common form of the name used in English''' if none of the rules below cover a specific problem.&quot; Furthermore, the convention says that it applies to rulers ''after'' the fall of the Roman Empire. But there is one interesting part of the convention that could help with this situation: &quot;If a monarch or prince is overwhelmingly known, in English, by a cognomen, it may be used, and there is then no need to disambiguate by adding Country. Examples: [[Alfred the Great]], [[Charlemagne]], [[Louis the Pious]], [[Henry the Lion]], [[Skanderbeg]], etc...&quot;.
::The complaints about the &quot;problematic article title&quot; are overblown. What is &quot;Christian&quot; about the ''Oxford Classical Dictionary''?

== Another vote for a move to his actual name, with a redirect ==
I'm sorry I missed the above move vote. But check out [[Template:Roman_Emperors]], where &quot;the Apostate&quot; is the only descriptor. Even &quot;Constantine the Great&quot; is reasonably listed as [[Constantine I]]. &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; is bias, plain and simple. Even if some Classical Dictionaries still cling to the slant, I think Wikipedia should rise above it, through a policy of naming people (if not their actual names), a compromise between what they where most commonly known as in their era vs. a non-biased simplification, i.e. [[Julian II]].

== Boccaccio Illustration ==

This is not relevant to Julian. Although the illustration is certainly labelled (in the original) as being of &quot;Julyan&quot;, none of the classical sources that I'm aware of state that Julian's corpse was flayed or exhibited in such a way. However, the corpse of Valerian (emperor 253-260) was so treated. According to the sources, it was flayed and the skin dyed vermillion and displayed at a Persian temple. The illustration thus seems to depict Valerian, not Julian (regardless of its description, obviously not Boccacchio's own as it's in old English) and should be removed to the article on Valerian.

Yes, but as there is a Christian tradition - admittedly tenuous but there nonetheless - that Julian was killed by Mercurius. Keeping that illustration in the article is somewhat justified. There is no tradition - Christian or otherwise - in any source that Julian was skinned. The picture is just labelled incorrectly and refers to Valerian: I've given the reasons above. To keep it in merely perpetuates a labelling error.

To reiterate: The manuscript is wrong. Valerian was flayed. Julian was not. Nor is there any variant tradition that he was. Pretty though it is, the illustration is merely a mislabelled Valerian. Nothing more. To retain it in an **encyclopaedia** article on Julian gives the impression that either A) Julian suffered this fate (he did not), or B) That there is a tradition that Julian suffered this fate (there is none). The error of one ignorant English translator of Boccaccio is not to be perpetuated - indeed, perpetuated without question - in an educational article.

First. I fail to see how by any stretch of the imagination a medieval English translation of a 14th century Italian document can be considered a primary historical source for events that occured a millenium beforehand and a thousand miles away. What exactly is your definition of a primary historical source? Nor indeed should the errors of individual translators be repected or perpetuated. That is not the way an encyclopaedia article is written.
Second. Alternatives: 1) Why do you believe that this illustration depicts Emperor Julian anyway and not some other Julian? 2) It may depict the remains of Basil of Ancyra, flayed by Julian in 362. If this is so the whole label (not all of which is visible) may read something like &quot;Julyan killed Basil&quot; or &quot;Basil, martyred by Julyan&quot;. Either way there's nothing to support your conclusion that the illustration is of Emperor Julian apart from your own calculations.

Ignore the second point. All the manuscript text says is &quot;the skyn of Julyan&quot;.

:You say &quot;''I fail to see how by any stretch of the imagination a medieval English translation of a 14th century Italian document can be considered a primary historical source for events that occured a millenium beforehand and a thousand miles away.''&quot;, but I never said anything like that.

To quote your own words: &quot;The manuscript is a primary source and should be respected&quot;. Do you even know what a primary source is? NONE of the illustrations you allude to are historiographic primary sources for Julian's life. I quote wikipedias own definition: &quot;In historiography, it is a document, recording or other source of information that was created at roughly the time being studied, by an authoritative source, usually one with direct personal knowledge of the events being described.&quot; Hence my rebuttal that by no stretch of the imagination can an illustration produced in the Middles Ages be considered a primary source for events that occured 1000 years before.
I've addressed the reason for retaining the Mercurius illustration. When it was produced there is a pre-exiting Christian tradition - wrong though it was/is - that Julian was killed in battle not by Persians but by Mercurius. Thus there is validity in keeping this picture as it illustrates this tradition. The Mercurius tradition is addressed in the picture's legend. There is no tradition - Christian or otherwise - that Julian was flayed. The Boccaccio piece thus illustrates nothing more than the fact that a single person - Boccaccio or a translator or a transcriber - got their Roman emperors mixed up. It's the same reason why the famous Louvre statue - long thought to be Julian but now reidentified as a Hadrianic priest - no longer appears on this page. Though identified as Julian, it isn't him. 
Nor does the Boccacchio illustration add anything to what's in the text, where no reference is made to Julian being flayed (that would be because he wasn't). No does the legend warn that the picture is wrong. As it stands anyone coming to this article looking for information on Julian will read how he was killed in battle against the Persians, look at the illustration of &quot;the skyn of Julyan&quot;, and naturally assume that this was the ultimate fate suffered by his corpse. Leading people to make such incorrect assumptions with misleading illustrations is not the job of any encyclopaedia article.

:&quot;Do you even know what a primary source is?&quot; Yes, I know
:&quot;NONE of the illustrations you allude to are historiographic primary sources for Julian's life.&quot; Never said that.
:&quot;no stretch of the imagination can an illustration produced in the Middles Ages be considered a primary source for events that occured 1000 years before.&quot; I completely agree with you.
:&quot;Thus there is validity in keeping this picture (the Mercurius' one) as it illustrates this tradition. [...] It's the same reason why the famous Louvre statue - long thought to be Julian but now reidentified as a Hadrianic priest - no longer appears on this page. Though identified as Julian, it isn't him.&quot; There is a work of fiction contained in a 14th century manuscript that claims that is Julian; we might know he was not skinned at all, but it is true that (at least) a manuscript drawer of the 14th century believed it. The example of the priest staute is completely out of argument: the sculptor knew it was a priest, ''we'' made a mistake; on the other side, ''the 14th century drawer'' made a mistake, as ''the icon painter'' did the mistake, as ''Edward Armitage'' did the &quot;mistake&quot; (that is not a picture of Julian). Yet you do not apply the same principle to all the images, why? I think it would be better to explain Julian was not skinned in the text of the image, as it would be nice to say that Mercurius' story is a myth, but I think removing the image on the basis of its &quot;inerent error&quot; is wrong.--[[User:Sjappé|Sjappé]] ([[User talk:Sjappé|talk]]) 20:13, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

First. You stated that the manuscript was a primary source. That's why I quoted your own words.
Second. No I do not apply the same criteria to all the images. Armitage's painting does not veer from the historiographic sources; it's inclusion is thus valid. The Mercurius illustration does not veer from the Christian tradition; it's inclusion is thus valid. The Boccaccio illustration is at variance with everything we know about Julian's death and it should not be included, especially when there is no indication in the article that Boccaccio has made an error in mixing up his Roman emperors. 
Third. By you own arguement **anything** is liable to be included in **any** wikipedia article by just saying &quot;well, so-and-so represented so-and-so thus, therefore we should include it&quot;. I ask you: What exactly would be wrong with me inserting a crayon drawing of Julian being killed while crossing the road? By your own argument I mistakenly understand Julian's death is just as valid as how Boccacio mistakenly understood him: &quot;well, it's how one 21st century person believed it to be&quot;. By saying it's 14th century won't cut it either: this far after the event, a 1700 year remove is just as bad as a 1000 year one.
Fourth: How do you know this is Julian the Apostate?
The concensus still isn't with you. [[Special:Contributions/82.44.82.167|82.44.82.167]] ([[User talk:82.44.82.167|talk]]) 23:16, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
:#I never said it was a primary source for Julian's life. This is your misunderstanding.
:#Boccaccio illustration is the original contribution of (''at least'') a 14th century drawer. And, in this, is not different from Armitage's painting nor from the icon.
:#Wrong interpretation. The manuscript is a 14th century depiction of what a 14th century drawer (at least) thought about Julian. If the crayon drawing of Julian being killed while crossing the road would be enciclopedic if drawn by Michelangelo, for example, as it would be his (wrong) POV of Julian, as we show the (wrong) POV by Armitage and the wrong POV by the icon drawer.
:#The identification was made by those who own the manuscript and published the image, the British Library (did you even read the image description, before pontificating?)
:We got a single opinion, can you be satisfied with that? --[[User:Sjappé|Sjappé]] ([[User talk:Sjappé|talk]]) 11:28, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

First. 8 May 2008, 2038h: &quot;Even if it were wrong, the manuscript is a primary source and should be respected.&quot; Please explain how I've misinterpreted your statement. Being a translation, it's not even a primary source for Boccaccio.
Second. Again you fail to understand the difference between modern interpretations which keep to a historical source (Armitage) or traditional sources (Mercurius). Boccaccio's keeps to neither. It is not interpretation - there is nothing in the sources to indicated he was flayed. Nor is following a pre-existing tradition. If there was an antique source or tradition that Julian was flayed there would be no arguement. There isn't. Boccaccio, or a follower simply mistook Julian for Valerian (Boccaccio also wrote on Valerian's death. This would explain the mix-up of emperors by an English illustrator). The illustration CANNOT be an interpretation - as there is nothing to interpret from. It is thus invention or error. Repeatedly falling back on the same argument that the image is 14th century doesn't cut it. Antiquity does not equate with validity. Nor are all sources to be given equal validity. That's not how history is done. Would a medieval image of Diocletian crossing the Rubicon be fit to have in an encyclopaedia? Of course not, it would be an obvious (though interesting) mistake by one source. Are the Roman plays of Shakespeare and Jonson valid historical documents for the events surrounding Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Sejanus? No, because though based on classical sources they include elements that are complete fiction. However, if the image must stay by all means transfer it to the Valerian site (as long as you explain the mistaken legend).

To answer your question &quot;Would a medieval image of Diocletian crossing the Rubicon be fit to have in an encyclopaedia?&quot; Of course ''yes'', it would be nice and informative to know that a medioeval picture drawer, for some reason, made this mistake, but believed (this is the point) that that was Julian. To take another example, it is good to remove the priest statue tought to be Julian, it would be much better to put it back and actually write that it was tought to be Julian but now it is considered to be a priest.
:&quot;However, if the image must stay by all means transfer it to the Valerian site (as long as you explain the mistaken legend).&quot; No! The manuscript included that picture to show Julian, not Diocletian, so this is the correct place.

I'm afraid you'll never make a historian. Uncritically assigning equal weight to all evidence is a schoolboy error. Upon seeing a picture labelled as Diocletian crossing the Rubicon, Alexander the Great fighting at Thermopylae, or Antony winning the Battle of Actium, most sensible observers would see them as curious blunders of the historically inept. Nothing more. You'd consider them some viable variant of the truth, despite the overwhelming evidence of more reliable sources and the lack of supporting sources. They'd become important documents for nothing more than the fact that **one** person depicted them in that way. The conclusion that an unintentioned mistake had been made would not enter your mind. Thus the error of a lone illustrator is let to pass without criticism. Indeed, it becomes a &quot;primary source&quot; for how Julian was perceived in medieval England (see below). If you wish I'll be happy to edit the legend of the &quot;Julian&quot; illustration to reflect this. 
Or, seeing that the score is still 2-1 in favour of getting rid of it, so it may have to go regardless...
As an aside, the illustration comes from a manuscript of John Lydgate's &quot;The Fall of Princes&quot; (15th century), which itself is an English translation of Boccaccio's &quot;De Casibus Virorum Illustribus&quot; from a century earlier. It's current legend as &quot;The Fall of Princes&quot; by Boccaccio is thus wrong anyway.

: Imho, the image should go but your edit of the legend is an acceptable compromise. Though I would prefer it a a bit shorter, e.g. &quot;Illustration from John Lydgate's translation of ''De Casibus Virorum Illustribus'' (by Giovanni Boccaccio) depicting &quot;the skyn of Julyan&quot;. The illustrator may have confused the fate of Julian's body with that of emperor Valerian&quot;. [[User:Dipa1965|Dipa1965]] ([[User talk:Dipa1965|talk]]) 19:13, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Eastern&quot; Roman Emperor ==

Julian was the emperor of a united empire. To the person who keeps reverting the page to read &quot;Eastern Roman Emperor&quot;, please stop.[[Special:Contributions/82.44.82.167|82.44.82.167]] ([[User talk:82.44.82.167|talk]]) 16:40, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
:&quot;Eastern Roman Emperor&quot; is a common term when refering to the ruler of the Roman Empire after 330.(for more info see [[Byzantine Empire]]) [[User:AdrianCo|AdrianCo]] ([[User talk:AdrianCo|talk]]) 11:20, 12 March 2008 (UTC)
:: I think that a reference to another wikipedia article isn't a very strong argument. Roman Empire was entirely unified in the days of the Constantinian dynasty (with an exception for the first years of Constantius reign) so 'Easter Roman emperor' sounds a little absurd in that case. Add to this that Julian's career started in the West. The location of the capital isn't that important, since from Dicletian's days it was already away of Rome. What do the rest of you think?

My stand is clear and I agree with the above contributor. During the period 324-364 (i.e. from the final victory of Constantine I to the accession of Valens and Valentinian I - which, incidentally, marks the actual commencement of what might be called the &quot;Eastern Roman Empire&quot; (not 330)), while Caesares may have held &quot;west&quot;/&quot;east&quot; appointments, Augusti did not. Augusti were, as with the vast majority of the period 27 BC-286, in sole charge. The current reading implies that Julian, as Augustus, ruled over ONLY the eastern half of the empire. Who ruled over the west? errr, Julian! Indeed, Julian was proclaimed in the west. Of course, feel free to edit to make the introduction read &quot;Western Roman Emperor 361-363, and Eastern Roman Emperor 361-363&quot;, but I think it's far more sensible to call him just &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; because that's what he was! 8o) [[Special:Contributions/82.44.82.167|82.44.82.167]] ([[User talk:82.44.82.167|talk]]) 20:09, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

: I don't disagree with Adrian; he was a Byzantine emperor and a Roman Emperor. [[User:Tourskin|Tourskin]] ([[User talk:Tourskin|talk]]) 04:55, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

Your condescension (&quot;for anyone that does not know that it exists...&quot;) does you no credit, especially considering the fact that your talking to a Roman History PhD candidate. Cheers! Calling Julian &quot;also Byzantine emperor&quot; is as inaccurate as calling him an &quot;Eastern Roman Emperor&quot;. Granted, Constantine I re-founded Byzantium as capital in the east, but the division of the governence of the empire (by Augusti) into east and west did not occur until a year after Julian's death. Julian could not have been the emperor of an empire that did not exist during his lifetime.

Well, my humble opinion is that we don't need another edit war (it's really going to be like that) just for a minor matter of semantics. Can we agree that &quot;Byzantine&quot; is an rather outdated and misleading term, particularly when we are talking about the unified Late Roman Empire? Is it SO important that the capital had been moved away of Rome? Is Diocletian a Byzantine emperor because he was based at Nicomedia? (not to mention other &quot;Byzantine&quot; qualities of his, like the autocratic behaviour, usage of precious clothing and paraphernalia etc) Does Byzantine betrays something important for the personality and the policies of Julian? There are already quite a few scholars who are unhappy with the term &quot;Byzantine&quot; even for later periods (e.g. J. Haldon in his ''Byzantine Wars'' uses it only in the title, while in the body he always prefers &quot;Roman&quot; or &quot;Eastern Roman&quot;). Let's concentrate on improving the body of the article. [[User:Dipa1965|Dipa1965]] ([[User talk:Dipa1965|talk]]) 18:03, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

Perhaps you have all moved on but I think Julian II is more appropriate then &quot;the apostate.&quot; Numbering of monarchs/emperors is commonplace, as is referring to them by nickname(those that have a well known one) but &quot;the apostate&quot; is full of religous sentiment and has a pejorative connotation. I understand early Christian sources used this term, and its worth noting in the article, but I think Julian II would be more appropraite in this instance.

==&quot;The Destruction of the Pagan Temples&quot; link==
It is entirely out of context (because it referes to Theodosius reign) and I would have removed it but the whole article is still a mess so such a minor editing wouldn't help much. Not to mention another annoyance: after the recent anonymous editing of the birth date, we have 331 in the lead and 330 in the body of the article!
