== Genome ==

I am moving some text about the genome here. I don't think that it should be included in the general article about the tammar wallaby.

The tammar wallaby's genome consists of 3.6 [[wikt:gigabase|gigabases]] and has a short genetic map length of 1172 [[centimorgan]]s.&lt;ref name=genome&gt;{{cite web|author=Marshall Graves, J. A; Wakefield, M. J.; Renfree, M. B.; Cooper, D. W.; Speed, T.; Lindblad-Toh, K.; Lander, E. S.; Wilson, R. K.|year=2003|title=Proposal to sequence the genome of the model marsupial ''Macropus eugenii'' (Tammar Wallaby)|publisher=[[National Human Genome Research Institute]]|url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/WallabySEQ.pdf|pages=1–3|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tammar Wallaby.jpg|thumb|right|Tammars are easy to keep in captivity.]]

This picture in the &quot;Genome&quot; section seems to show a wallaby eating something on the side of a tree. It does not illustrate the point made in the caption &quot;Tammars are easy to keep in captivity.&quot; [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:16, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

:I replaced it with the &lt;s&gt;Budapest&lt;s&gt; Buffalo zoo image. [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 03:58, 26 May 2012 (UTC)

== Species ==

From &quot;Taxonomy and classification&quot;, subsection &quot;Subspecies&quot;: &quot;''All the island tammars were once thought to be of one species.''&quot; Aren't they still thought to be one species? [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:14, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

The tammar wallaby is also native to new Zealand? The map in the infobox only shows Australia. [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:17, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

:The island tammars are not considered one species. With regards to the map, I can't find one with New Zealand, I think the natural range is more imporant but one is free to create a map with both the natural and introduced ranges. [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 01:08, 3 June 2012 (UTC)
:: Ah, sorry, I misunderstood the meaning of the sentence about the island tammars. How about changing it to &quot;The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population.&quot; [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 08:16, 3 June 2012 (UTC)

== Phylogeny ==

I have drawn a diagram of the of the phylogeny of marsupials based on the  figure in Renfree MB, Papenfuss AT, Deakin JE, et al. This might be useful. [[:File:Phylogeny of marsupials.png]] [[User:GrahamColm|Graham Colm]] ([[User talk:GrahamColm|talk]]) 17:53, 7 June 2012 (UTC)

:Thanks, however I have one question. The source they cite for this tree actually gives [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2375000/figure/F2/ three trees] for ''Macropus'' phylogeny. Is is a problem? [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 18:33, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
:Also, I would prefer a tree focused only on the ''Macropus'' genus. [[User:LittleJerry|LittleJerry]] ([[User talk:LittleJerry|talk]]) 18:36, 7 June 2012 (UTC)

::The authors argue that the third tree is the closer approximation. Here is an edited version of my drawing, which shows the ''Macropodidae'' branch only. [[:File:Phylogeny of Macropodidae.png]] [[User:GrahamColm|Graham Colm]] ([[User talk:GrahamColm|talk]]) 20:44, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
::: In the middle of the diagram, it is a little confusing as to which line corresponds to each species. Perhaps if you can bring the text slightly lower down and closer to the lines, that would be helpful. [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:03, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
:::I have tweaked it; you might have to flush your cache to see the difference. [[User:GrahamColm|Graham Colm]] ([[User talk:GrahamColm|talk]]) 22:21, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
:::: Okay, it's a little better. Isn't it possible to bring the text right on top of the lines? [[User:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;'''Axl'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;#3CB371&quot;&gt;¤&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Axl|&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:51, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
