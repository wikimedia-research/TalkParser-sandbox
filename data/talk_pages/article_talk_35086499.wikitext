[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia, one or more of the [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] you added to the page [[:Wikipedia:Requested templates]] do not comply with our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines for external links]] and have been removed. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used as a platform for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion, and doing so is contrary to the goals of this project. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the [[Wikipedia talk:Requested templates|article's talk page]] before reinserting it. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia.
