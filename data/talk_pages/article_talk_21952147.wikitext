It's unnecessary a space between Xinhua and Lu. Its name is Xinhualu correctly. —[[User:Dj nix|Dj nix]] ([[User talk:Dj nix|talk]]) 14:22, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. Do you have any evidence to support this? Xinhua Lu Stadium [http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1T4HPEA_en-GBGB255GB255&amp;q=%22Xinhua+Lu+Stadium%22+-wikipedia&amp;meta=] and Xinhualu Stadium [http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4HPEA_en-GBGB255GB255&amp;q=%22Xinhualu+Stadium%22] get a fairly even number of ghits.

*At first, Do you understand any chinese languages? Anyway see the sites as [http://bbs.winning11cn.com/viewthread.php?tid=546321] and [http://bbs.nankai.edu.cn/cgi-bin/bbs/bbstcon?board=SportsGame&amp;file=M.1190693411.A]. If you write the alphabet from chinese characters, Then It's unnecessary a space between ''Xinhua'' and ''Lu'' normally. Or ''Lu'' means ''Road''. So Its name is Xinhua Road Stadium as [http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/44320654.html]
**No, I don't understand Chinese languages, which is why you need to be more clear with your request. I'm not sure what those links are meant to prove, as (and I said this above) there are plenty of other sites which use &quot;Xinhua Lu&quot; ([http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/asia/china/wuhan_xinhua.shtml], [http://www.fussballtempel.net/afc/CHN.html]).

***Well, I know that some sites use &quot;Xinhua Lu&quot;. But They JUST use that. Do you able to prove that they have the trustworthy information? It's not the proof that they just use that. Anyway [http://www.gamingaccess.com/functions/showimage.php?image_download=http://www.socceraccess.net/download/images/11197-whmk4.jpg# This] is a screenshot of Pro Evolution Soccer 6 and [http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp?player=10007698 Here] is the official site of the Davis Cup (tennis). -[[User:Dj nix|Dj nix]] ([[User talk:Dj nix|talk]]) 17:21, 13 April 2008 (UTC)
*this is just a small problem, england stadium space between name and road ([[en:White Hart Lane]] /[[en:Portman Road]]), so my opinion is space it :) is ok to use Xinhua Lu. - [[User talk:galaxyharrylion|galaxyharrylion]]  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|comment]] was added at 05:31, 14 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
**Yeah, I know that this is a small problem. It's a mistake of neither &quot;Xinhua Lu&quot; nor &quot;Xinhualu&quot;. But I don't understand why somebody just OPPOSES it. I know that some english stadium space between name and road. So I had proposed that made this to the '''''Xinhua Road Stadium''''' in english before. Well I don't care that &quot;Xinhua Lu&quot; or &quot;Xinhualu&quot;. [[User:Dj nix|Dj nix]] ([[User talk:Dj nix|talk]]) 10:53, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Official pinyin guidelines state that general names of places (City, River, Province, etc.) are separated from the proper names when romanised: &quot;汉语地名中的专名和通名分写，每一分写部分的第一个字母大写&quot;; e.g. &quot;Beijing Shi&quot; not &quot;Beijingshi&quot;, &quot;Hebei Sheng&quot; not &quot;Hebeisheng&quot;, etc. [[User:CaliforniaAliBaba|cab]] ([[User talk:CaliforniaAliBaba|talk]]) 05:45, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
**You meant ''names of places'' (地名), ''cities, provinces and towns.'' Alright you said it's '''''&quot;OFFICIAL&quot;'''''. Some chinese governments' official sites written as &quot;Xinhualu&quot;, for example  [http://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node70862/node70868/node70908/node70912/userobject1ai73651.html this] and [http://hebei.mofcom.gov.cn/column/print.shtml?/sjqiyeml/200507/20050700188979 this]. So why do you say it's wrong? I can't get it. Whichsoever... [[User:Dj nix|Dj nix]] ([[User talk:Dj nix|talk]]) 10:53, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

The official name in english of this stadium is '''''Xinhua Road Sports Center'''''. [http://www.koelnmesse.com.sg/isfe-china/index.htm International Sports Facilities Expo (ISFE) China] called it so. See [http://www.koelnmesse.com.sg/isfe-china/ISFE07_Invited-Attendees.pdf the list of the official names in english of stadiums in China]. No one must meant the complaint any longer though I'll move this to '''''Xinhua Road Sports Center'''''. And &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Don't interfere so as not to know PLEASE'''&lt;/span&gt;. [[User:Dj nix|Dj nix]] ([[User talk:Dj nix|talk]]) 09:20, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
