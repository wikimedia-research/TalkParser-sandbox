Hey, how about a page for GEANT program - Detector Description and Simulation Tool
And probably a diasmbig. page needed...

The GEANT program describes the passage of elementary particles through the matter. Originally designed for the High Energy Physics experiments, it has today found applications also outside this domain in the areas of medical and biological sciencies, radioprotection and astronautics.
