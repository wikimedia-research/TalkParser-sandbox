[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Mark Schierbecker|Mark Schierbecker]]. I wanted to let you know that I removed one or more external links you added&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Smartbook]], because they seemed to be inappropriate for an encyclopedia.

[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please stop adding inappropriate [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Rajinikanth]]. It is considered [[Wikipedia:Spam|spamming]], and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#ADVERTISING|Wikipedia is not a vehicle for advertising or promotion]], so any further spamming will be regarded as [[WP:Vandalism|vandalism]]. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, additions of links to Wikipedia will not alter search engine rankings. If you continue spamming, you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia.

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=Stop icon]] You may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]] without further warning''' the next time you [[WP:vandalism|vandalize]] Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Siva Kumar]]. Persistent [[WP:Spam|spammers]] may have their websites [[Wikipedia:Spam blacklist|blacklisted]], preventing anyone from linking to them from all [[foundation:Our projects|Wikimedia sites]] as well as potentially being penalized by search engines.[[Category:User talk pages with Uw-spam4 notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam4 --&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;[[User:JJMC89|JJMC89]]&amp;thinsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:JJMC89|T]]'''·'''[[Special:EmailUser/JJMC89|E]]'''·'''[[Special:Contributions/JJMC89|C]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:37, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Smart iBook Education Website]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about an organization or company, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please read more about [[Wikipedia:Notability|what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Smart iBook Education Website|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Compassionate727|Compassionate727]] ([[User talk:Compassionate727|talk]]) 18:59, 17 August 2015 (UTC)
