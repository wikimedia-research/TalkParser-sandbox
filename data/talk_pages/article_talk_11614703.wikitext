== removing POV tag with no active discussion per [[Template:POV]] ==

I've removed an old neutrality tag from this page that appears to have no active discussion per the instructions at [[Template:POV]]:
::This template is not meant to be a permanent resident on any article. Remove this template whenever:
::#There is consensus on the talkpage or the NPOV Noticeboard that the issue has been resolved
::#It is not clear what the neutrality issue is, and no satisfactory explanation has been given
::#In the absence of any discussion, or if the discussion has become dormant.

Since there's no evidence of ongoing discussion, I'm removing the tag for now. If discussion is continuing and I've failed to see it, however, please feel free to restore the template and continue to address the issues. Thanks to everybody working on this one! -- [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 01:13, 30 June 2013 (UTC)
