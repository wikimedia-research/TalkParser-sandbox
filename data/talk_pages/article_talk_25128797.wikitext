== Problem Domain ==

A discussion on the C++ problem domain could benefit this article. C++ is a general purpose language that can be applied to most programming problems, but often times other languages are considered more appropriate. I think this has some overlap with &quot;Adoption and reception&quot;. The following questions could be answered with citations:

*What is the original problem domain of C++? (answered in part already)
*Where has C++ been used in the past (and why)?
*Where is C++ used today (and why)?
*For what problems do experts recommend using C++?
*etc.

This article could be a can of worms for opinions and original research. Some camps declare it a dead language, others declare its better than almost any language thats' out there. So we must be extra careful to approach this with neutrality. The views of industry and research papers should be presented with citation, and we should avoid weasel words in the main article such as, &quot;Most/Few web applications are programmed in C++[1].....&quot; and &quot;The use of C++ is believed to be increasing/declining.[2]&quot; even if they are accompanied by citations. Instead i would prefer active voice citations such as &quot;Reliable source X stated that X% of web applications are programmed in C++.&quot; or &quot;Reliable Source Y states use of C++ is increasing/declining.&quot; In this way, we can at least limit our unconscious bias to the citations we find, rather than how we present them.[[User:Gsonnenf|Gsonnenf]] ([[User talk:Gsonnenf|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 02:06, 4 April 2009 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Attempt to resolve the Hello, World! debate ==

To accomodate both sides, both of which are correct, I updated the hello world sample in a table format with both versions side-by-side along with a note about the differences. I think it presents both versions, do not clutter, and contributes information while not confusing the issue.

Oh, it is not a question of references (which should be obvious since I even mentioned the specific section in the Standard, it is a question of providing a good overview and an immediately digestible illustration of something that apparently causes confusion to both newbies and seasoned verterans. Face it, if the section is changed two times per week, as the scare comments suggest, then there is a problem with the section. Not necessarily anything wrong, but a problem nonetheless. For sake of discussion, this is the update to the section I suggested (here placed inside a border not intended for the article):
&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:0.5em;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Use this and you (1) retain the Standard example, (2) illustrate a subtle aspect of the Standard that cause confusion, (3) avoid confusion, and (4) avoid edit warring. I get the feeling there is turf protection and pride somewhere in this, which of course is silly. Information and education is more important.

:But then we'll be revisiting the dreary discussions of whether &lt;ostream&gt; should be included, whether std::endl is even &quot;recommended&quot; at all (we don't want suggest that &quot;\n&quot; is synonymous with std::endl because excessive flushing can be a problem), and whether we should return 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS (one could argue that 0 is platform-specific and hence inappropriate).

:Despite its source, I have to agree that the Stroustrup version's missing return statement is bewildering. Our first example of a C++ program should be a ''typical'' one that does not point out exceptional cases. Newbies are prone to overgeneralization of new concepts, and this compounds the issue. I don't care so much about other details (0 or EXIT_SUCCESS, \n or std::endl), but pedagogy demands a return statement. [[User:Dcoetzee|Dcoetzee]] 20:29, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

== Hello World \n ==

In C and C++, \n is an escape character for the newline character in strings. However, if written to a text stream (as cout), it also represents an actual newline. It's one of the tasks of the input/output library to recognize this character and do whatever is necessary in the host OS to cause a new line. If Visual Studio gets this wrong, its not conforming. I would be surprised about the first, but not about the second. I don't have a strong opinion on the whole &quot;Hello World&quot; thing yet. But a version with neither '\n' or std::endl is  plain broken. --[[User:Stephan Schulz|Stephan Schulz]] ([[User talk:Stephan Schulz|talk]]) 07:09, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

:I thought the \n translation was strictly related to files. In any case, it doesn't work for me (doesn't represent a newline on the console), and it would surprise me if the worlds' most used version of C++ wasn't standards-compliant. Whose to say a Hello World should have a newline anyway? Honestly, though, I think it should. I just wish SheffieldSteel &amp; XercesNine would stop trying to own this article, and allow the rest of us to put a 'std:endl' where it should be.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wikipendant|Wikipendant]] ([[User talk:Wikipendant|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikipendant|contribs]]) 07:23, 12 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

A logical, honest debate can actually yield a much higher quality block of code than one that was cited from some random document 20 years ago.

::::There are about 400 billion different ways to write a hello world program, but only one of them has the very special distinction of being authored by the inventor of the language and published in the principle reference for the language. It has nothing to do with me or the other editors here &quot;owning&quot; the article (personally, it's not my favorite version of hello world either), it has to do with this being a very contentious topic (for some ungodly reason) and in cases like that it's best to stick to the version that has ''rock-solid sourcing''. That's all. Now can we drop it now and move on? Is this really so important? :-) [[User:ATren|ATren]] ([[User talk:ATren|talk]]) 05:23, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

:::::There are 400 billion ways to write a sentence, too. That doesn't mean that all are equally correct. I didn't realize this was such a contentious topic (I'm new), but at the same time, the management of this article is frustrating. Going back hundreds of diffs, there seems to be hundreds of editors all clamoring for the &quot;standard&quot; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; approach. That seems like consensus to me. The only reason it doesn't stay that way is because most editors don't realize that there's a talk page, or that this topic is so controversial for some reason. The hello world stays the way it is because it is correct in the eyes of the few, persistent editors (ATren, Xerxesnine, and SheffieldSteel), and in fact doesn't represent the opinion of the community at large. Just going back through the diffs irrefutably validates this fact. The workflow seems to be: 
1. A new editor stumbles across the page.
2. The editor notices the obviously strange hello world, and changes it. 
3. ATren, SheffieldSteel, or Xerxesnine instantly reverts it. 
4. The new editor, oblivious to the reversion, goes on his way. 
This seems to happen over and over and over again. Anybody not trying to prove a point, or own the article, would've noticed the pattern by now. I don't mean to drag this discussion out of the grave, but I wasn't there for it, and it seems like enough people want to see a &quot;more correct&quot; version of hello world on wikipedia that it is still an issue. I don't want to be argumentative, but the matter-of-fact way that the reverts are handled, and the obnoxious warnings all over the hello world section seem pretentious and reeks of ownership problems. I can only imagine how frustrating this has been to the untold number of people who try to improve this article, only to have it instantly reverted by this small set of editors with an opinion on the hello world and the article on their watchlist. There's a better hello world - you know it, I know it, and hundreds of other people who have edited the article in the past know it. Is there a reason we're not using it? Citing a 20 year old example from the birth of C++ isn't sufficient, regardless of pedigree, and in fact showcases a weird artifact of the language (the newline escape-character overload) that will be confusing for a long time after learning the language. I'm sorry if I seem combative, but this is just an unbelievably frustrating introduction to the Wikipedia community, in which the community itself seems to actively resist the improvement of an article because of a handful of influential, active editors opinions.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wikipendant|Wikipendant]] ([[User talk:Wikipendant|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wikipendant|contribs]]) 17:21, 13 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Conesnus should be achieved by contributors no? What do you mean better ? Why do you see flushing a buffer before its flushed anyways as better than current version? Your deffinition of better seems kindof strange too me. Also cant see how you see outputing &quot;\n&quot; as an artifact, surely in C++ you use endl whenever you can?

:OK, there's the three editors Wikipendant mentioned, plus this IP, plus Stephen Schulz, plus the depated Yamla, and I think there may be a few others all in support of this consensus. That's half a dozen users against one editor here and a few passerbys over the last 6 months. I think that can safely be considered a solid consensus for such a mild issue, but you do have recourse if you like: if you really believe you have a case, then you should bring it to dispute resolution by filing a [[WP:RFC]] to solicit wider input. Personally, I wouldn't do it (remember, as I said before I don't even like this version, but it works and it's well-sourced so I accept it) but it's there if you want it.

::Don't speak for Stephen Shulz, or Yamla - Let them speak for themselves if they must! Stephen was against my edit, which to be honest, I didn't even agree with fully. And as for the anon IP's comments, endl isn't going to flush the buffer twice. The compiler will take care of that. The reason \n is confusing is because it's an overloaded escape character. MacOs &amp; Windows don't actually use '\n' to signify a new line: People familiar with programming know this. However, C++ weirdly changes this for certain stream operations, and doesn't change it for other functions related to I/O. Confusing, no? This could potentially cause seriously strange behavior that a newbie to C++ wouldn't understand - mora than this, he shouldn't HAVE to understand it. Almost ever hello world example for c++ uses cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello World&quot; &lt;&lt; endl, and with good reason: It's easily readable, and not subject to the confusion '\n' causes.

::::Compiler wont take care of things its forbidden to take care of, anyways we dont discuss compilers here but C++ language, and according to it your HW version would flush std::cout twice once in std::endl (which is not much more than '\n' + std::flush), and another time at destructor of ios_base::Init object which purpouse is just to do that - flush builtin streams at program termination. Also, '\n' is no more confusing than std::endl, as the later uses the former, plus whats so confusing? Could you point out?.

And I'l also repeat that the cited version is not MY preferred version either, but it is sourced to an impeccably reliable source so it should stand. Now please don't revert again without further discussion here. [[User:ATren|ATren]] ([[User talk:ATren|talk]]) 14:16, 24 August 2008 (UTC)

I argue this issue to be silly on grounds of triviality. A non-C++ programmer does not need to understand the HW example, it is merely to show what the code looks like. Other examples, which may demonstrate to the coder specific features, are what need to be clear and readable. An experienced C++ programmer will not use it as a reference of how to code because s/he will have learned how to code already. We do not need to demonstrate good practices because it is trivial and is not an apropiete reference. I think a version that demonstrates TYPICAL C++ CODE would be most apropriete here, as the goal of putting a HW example in (seemingly) every programming language article is simply to show what the language looks like, and in a comparible way. The argument in my opinion should be on whether the given example is typical code. I can't really answer that.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:SplinterOfChaos|SplinterOfChaos]] ([[User talk:SplinterOfChaos|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/SplinterOfChaos|contribs]]) 23:01, 25 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

BTW: There must be hundreds of examples of published Hello Worlds out there. As mentioned, no other programming-language article is forced to cite a published source on Hello World, so doesn't that mean we are being inconsistent with Wikipedia? And what does verifiability ''mean'' here? That it compiles? Well, it's obvious it will. What makes Bjarne's HW more verifiable than the homeless guy's down the street?

Reading this discussion, I have to point out that the '\n' escape character is handled by C++, and not the &quot;operating system&quot;, as 83.25.78.242 has stated. It also is overloaded, in the sense that the '\n' character's meaning changes from streaming to file operations, sometimes representing the newline character, other times representing the operating system's newline, depending on context. It is therefore confusing, and I vote it to be replaced with the more sensible std::endl, or follow the more readable standard of &quot;using namespace std;&quot;, therefore allowing the code to be less confusing. The std:: prefix is ugly and can be confusing to a new user of C++, as can the fact that we rely on an escape character whose meaning shifts under context.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/168.105.121.38|168.105.121.38]] ([[User talk:168.105.121.38|talk]]) 23:17, 1 September 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Overloading has a well defined meaning in scope of C++ language. Usage of std::endl is no less confusing than usage of '\n' - the former uses the later, and does some other things as well - being more compilcated id say endl may be more confusing than '\n' (also note that '\n' is pretty universal among languages, whereas std::endl is not). '\n' is just a character constnat, what happens when outputed to a file stream (in whatever mode) or console is implementation specific (language spec doesnt mention what happens there, maybe theres something in C lang spec that gets inherited, but i dont have a copy of C draft/spec handy) and thus depends on underlying operating system. Prefixes being ugly is just your personal opinin, also why would 'using namespace std;' be more readable than explicit qualification of names? - and for new to C++ it may cause even more confusion as it introduces 2 new keywords.

===Basis for discussion===
If editors here can agree on any one version as being the absolute best example of hello.cpp, I will not object to changing the article to include that version. The flipside, however, is that I will revert any change to the article that does ''not'' reflect consensus. &lt;font color=&quot;006622&quot;&gt;[[User:SheffieldSteel|S&lt;small&gt;HEFFIELD&lt;/small&gt;S&lt;small&gt;TEEL&lt;/small&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User_talk:SheffieldSteel|TALK]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:10, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

The issues that have been raised are as follows:-
:# (A) include &lt;iostream&gt; (B) include &lt;istream&gt; ''and'' &lt;ostream&gt; ''separately''
:# (A) '\n' (B) std::endl
:# (A) std:: ''where necessary'' (B) using namespace std;

What about ''using std::cout;'' and ''using std::endl;'' before the ''cout'' line? Anyway, my vote is for what's typically seen in real-life code (which is what I think a Hello World in any language should be an example of). #include &lt;istream&gt; is rarely seen in the code I've looked at, so I vote for &lt;iostream&gt;. I've seen ''using std::whatever;'' in code where that thing is used a lot, but rarely else where, so seeing as cout and endl are only used once, I vote for using std:: where necessary.

:That works with most, but not all compilers (Tru64 is an exception) [[User:Tedickey|Tedickey]] ([[User talk:Tedickey|talk]]) 09:58, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

::The using keyword is standard; any compiler that does not support it is non-standard conforming. Do we really need to worry about them? I'm inclined to believe that only the standard can define what the language is, so those compilers are can be omitted in this discussion.Posted by: [[User:SplinterOfChaos|SoC]] ([[User talk:SplinterOfChaos|talk]]) -- Posted at:: 04:45, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:::Agree, provided that editors remember to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the term ''standard'', rather than provide nonfactual discussion [[User:Tedickey|Tedickey]] ([[User talk:Tedickey|talk]]) 09:53, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:The argument for &quot;real-life code&quot; misses the point of the hello world example, which is to provide a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; programming example.  The std::endl, return statement, and using namespace declaration all unnecessarily add to the complexity of the code. &quot;Hello World&quot; examples are generally intended to be as understandable as possible to beginners and non-programmers with as little explanation as possible.  They do not exist to show best or common practice. [[User:Krelborne|Krelborne]] ([[User talk:Krelborne|talk]]) 14:36, 17 September 2008 (UTC)
