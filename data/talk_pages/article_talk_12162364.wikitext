i broke my scaphoid and it SUCKS! it won't heal! --17:20, 20 July 2007 66.203.184.15

When I broke mine 23 years ago, my doc told me it's the slowest healing bone in the body. I was casted to above my elbow for 8 weeks and casted on the forearm for another 6 weeks. --[[Special:Contributions/24.6.228.145|24.6.228.145]] ([[User talk:24.6.228.145|talk]]) 03:04, 29 April 2011 (UTC)

==σφηνῳδής==
Why does it have the word &quot;sphenoid&quot; in Greek letters (σφηνῳδής)? Is this the correct Classic Greek term for the scaphoid bone? Or a blunder when something like σκαφοειδές is meant? [[User:Pliny|Pliny]] ([[User talk:Pliny|talk]]) 11:14, 20 December 2012 (UTC)

:I think that there is a mistake. The right name for this bone in ancient Greek is [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dskafoeidh%2Fs σκαφοειδές]. I'm correcting it. [[User:Pompilos|Pompilos]] ([[User talk:Pompilos|talk]]) 15:01, 18 October 2013 (UTC)
