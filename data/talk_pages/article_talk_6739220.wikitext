== Mario as a last name ==

Hey; the surname 'Mario' attributed to Mario and Luigi only appears in the television series and movies based on the characters, and the last name was not ever officially endorsed by Nintendo.  As the article's focus is the character from Nintendo games, they are referred to as simply 'Mario' and 'Luigi'. See the second to last paragraph of [[Mario#Conception and creation]]. ~ [[User:PseudoSudo|PseudoSudo]] 22:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
