&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|left|50px]]This account, ''{{BASEPAGENAME}}'', has been blocked indefinitely from editing Wikipedia, because your username does not meet our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]].

'''Your username is the only reason for this block. You are welcome to choose a new username (see below).'''

A username should not be promotional, related to a &quot;real-world&quot; group or organization, misleading, offensive, or disruptive. Also, usernames may not end in the word &quot;bot&quot; unless the account is an approved [[WP:BOT|bot account]].&lt;/br&gt;

Please '''[[Special:Userlogin/signup|choose a new account name]]''' that meets our [[WP:U|policy]] guidelines. However, do not create a new account if you wish to credit your existing contributions to a new name through a '''[[Wikipedia:Changing username|username change]]'''. To request a username change:
:# Add &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-un|''your new username here''}} {{#switch:{{NAMESPACE}}|User talk=below.|on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].}} You should be able to edit this talk page even though you are blocked. If not, you may wish to contact the blocking administrator by clicking on &quot;E-mail this user&quot; on their talk page.
:# At an administrator's discretion, you may be unblocked for 24 hours to file a request.
:# Please note that you may only request a name that is not already in use, so please check [[Special:ListUsers|here]] for a list of names that have already been taken. For more information, please see [[Wikipedia:Changing username]].

If you feel that you were blocked in error, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|Your reason here}} below, but you should read our [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first. {{#if:|[[User:PMDrive1061|PMDrive1061]] ([[User talk:PMDrive1061|talk]]) 03:30, 12 November 2009 (UTC)}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Uw-ublock --&gt;{{#switch:User talk|User|User talk=}}{{z12}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-ublock --&gt; --[[User:PMDrive1061|PMDrive1061]] ([[User talk:PMDrive1061|talk]]) 03:30, 12 November 2009 (UTC)
