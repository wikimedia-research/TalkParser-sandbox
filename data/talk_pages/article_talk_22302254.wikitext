==Username Concern==

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome to Wikipedia]]!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]] for the following reason: It is a promotional username. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
* If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
* If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes|dispute resolution process]], such as [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names|requesting comments]] from other Wikipedians.  [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Wikipedia administrators]] usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
* You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit [[Wikipedia:Changing username]] and follow the guidelines there.

{{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}  &lt;!-- Template:uw-username --&gt; [[User:GT5162|GT5162]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:GT5162|(我的对话页)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:54, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|40px]]Your account has been '''blocked indefinitely from editing Wikipedia''', because it has been identified as an account used for promotion of a company or group, with a username that implies that this has been done by that company or group.''' See '''[[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organization]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]]''.

This kind of activity is considered [[Wikipedia:Spam|spamming]] and forbidden by policies, and also violates [[Wikipedia:Username policy|our username policy]]. 

However, if you feel that there has been a mistake in your blocking, please  [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|Your reason here}} {{#switch:{{NAMESPACE}}|User talk=below|on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]]}} or email the administrator who blocked you. Your reason should include your response to this issue ''and'' a new username you wish to adopt that does not violate our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]] (specifically, understand that accounts are for individuals, not companies or groups, and that your username should reflect this).  Please check that your new username has not already been taken by checking  [[Special:ListUsers|this list]]. {{#if:1|—[[User:Wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:Wknight94|talk]]) 11:27, 6 April 2009 (UTC)}}&lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt;
