[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. A page you recently created{{#if:Talk:Shorpe|, [[:Talk:Shorpe]],}} may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]] for new pages, so it will shortly be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|removed]] (if it hasn't been already).

:Is there a particular reason you keep recreating [[Talk:Shorpe]] and [[Talk:Shorpe problem]] as redirects?  They keep getting deleted as they are unlikely search terms.  If you have an interest in the [[Scunthorpe problem]] article, why not edit it instead and try and improve it? ~ &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot;&gt;Amory&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#555555&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt; ''([[User:Amorymeltzer|u]] • [[User talk:Amorymeltzer|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amorymeltzer|c]])''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 15:40, 23 October 2009 (UTC)
