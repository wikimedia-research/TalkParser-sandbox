== Article tuned into redirect  ==

The article had an inadequate name and practically no contents. The topic is covered in much more detail in the artciles [[Mixture model]] and [[Mixture distribution]] (which may be merged eventually) Therefore this article was turned into a redirect to &quot;Mixture model&quot;. --[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] ([[User talk:Jorge Stolfi|talk]]) 04:56, 11 February 2013 (UTC)
