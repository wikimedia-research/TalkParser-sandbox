==Suggest merging with [[Working men's club]]==

I wrote the original article on Working Men's clubs - i suggest that there is sufficient overlap between that article and this article for the two to be combined

==Merger of [[Working Mens Club and Institute Union]] into this article==
I agree: the correct grammar is ''Men's'' and not ''Mens''. [[User:Alan Davidson|Alan Davidson]] 09:24, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:Merge done. [[User:SilkTork|SilkTork]] 11:20, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

The full list should be in a separate article.[[User:Johncmullen1960|Johncmullen1960]] ([[User talk:Johncmullen1960|talk]]) 06:58, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
Well  actually to be frank I don't think the list should be in an encyclopedia - surely a link to the website of the confederation is enough. But if someone really wants it in wikipedia, a separate article is necessary. I have moved it here for now [[User:Johncmullen1960|Johncmullen1960]] ([[User talk:Johncmullen1960|talk]]) 07:01, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
