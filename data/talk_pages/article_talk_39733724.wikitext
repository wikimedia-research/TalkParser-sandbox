==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article or image appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. This article or image appears to be a direct copy from http://www.accessdunia.com.my/cnki. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''.

If the external website or image belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text or image — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website or image but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &amp;mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 20:55, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
