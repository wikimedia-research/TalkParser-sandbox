==[[Grand Union Railway]]==
I note you've been doing some work adding the Grand Union route to stations it is due to serve. I intend to remove this because I don't think it is appropriate at this time. As far as I am aware, there has been no confirmation that this service will get the go ahead and even if it did the earliest it could commence is 2011/2012 according to http://www.grandcentralrail.co.uk/grand_union.html. Please feel free to contact me to discuss this further if you don't understand my reasoning for removing the route. Regards. [[User:Adambro|Adambro]] 12:02, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

==AfD nomination of [[Bad Day (film)]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]An editor has nominated [[Bad Day (film)]], an article on which you have worked or that you created, for [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion]].  We appreciate your contributions, but the nominator doesn't believe that the article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion and has explained why in his/her nomination (see also &quot;[[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot;).  

Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at {{#if:Bad Day (film) | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bad Day (film)]] | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bad Day (film)]] }} and please be sure to [[WP:SIG|sign your comments]] with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  

You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the [[WP:AfD|articles for deletion]] template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate.  Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:AFDNote --&gt; [[User:BJBot|BJBot]] ([[User talk:BJBot|talk]]) 17:29, 8 January 2008 (UTC)
