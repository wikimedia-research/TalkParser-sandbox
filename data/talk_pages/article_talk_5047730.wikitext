Since the purpose of an encyclopedia is to expedite knowledge, I'm not going to change anything, but the 47th Flying Training Wing article is linked to the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] article. The 47th Bomb Wing in World War II, however, has NO connection whatsoever to the 47th Flying Training Wing here. The USAF 47th FTW is a descendent of the 47th Bomb GROUP, a medium bomber outfit with the [[Twelfth Air Force]].--Buckboard 16:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
