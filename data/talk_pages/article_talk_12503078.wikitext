==Matt'N'Ian TV - An affiliated station==


Just so you all know - we are a fully affiliated NaSTA station now. So I added us to the Wikipedia Page. Please dont delete us, we are officially joined now!!

* That's fair enough - but you shouldn't link to 'BuffTV media encoder' and your names unless there should be an article about them - which there probably shouldn't as they aren't notable enough (Unless either Matt or Ian are quite famous, or BuffTV encoder is a notable piece of software). Bear in mind that the article on NaSTA as a whole barely survived deletion.

**One more thing, 87.127.73.46, you should never edit other people's comments, it is often considered vandalism. The issue above has been fixed,  so a note underneath saying 'now fixed' would be sufficient, rather than deleting most of the comment. I've reverted the edit. -             

Sorry, 87.127.73.46

* I've removed the &quot;references&quot; from Matt'N'Ian's sections; [[WP:NN]] requires external references to be independent, which these certainly aren't --[[User:JonRSharpe|JonRSharpe]]

STOP DELETING THIS. MattNIan qualified as a full station and paid full affiliation fees, and get this, even won three awards. So to say they were not part is just silly, they were part, and even won some. Why you reference a Google Cached page THAT WAS NEVER UPDATED FROM THE 2005 SEASON as your reasoning for removing them is insane. Leave it buddy. 

first please place new comments under ones previously made second please sign your comments. now on the matter you raised if you can provide a more recent [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifibility]] [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources|reliably]] sources, then please do so, also i would remind that you should not write about yourself and wait until such time as some one else feels you are notable, particularly in the case of someone who has been repeatedly warned for vandalism. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:54, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

--Reply--Not been accused of vandalism, ever, if have on this IP, its a shared work IP, so dont accuse me...And apart from photos of ian and matt at the event with awards in hand, and the actual awards themselves, there are no other items of proof because NaSTA 07's online work was virtually non existant so no proof ever went online because of &quot;website lost passwords&quot;

What do you want? A reference to an online photo? Its obvious to me you just dont like seeing that station on that list, everyone who attended NaSTA knows that station attended

well i suggest you register for an account or else you will be labelled as such. as for assertion of membership i have no personally feelings either way, however this is an encyclopedia which means you need a reliable source to back it. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 13:30, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

==More==

Which part of this article are people unsure about? [[User:Vanky|Vanky]] 22:36, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Not sure but I'm guessing it will be the formation date [[User:83.67.43.64|83.67.43.64]] 03:31, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

If you look at the NaSTA website, it seems as if nobody knows the exact formation date... [[User:Vanky|Vanky]] 12:06, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Action post deletion debate==
OK, I'd like to have a stab at a major article rewrite over the next few days, because (as evidenced by the deletion debate) this article doesn't really do NaSTA justice. I doubt that many/any of the station articles themselves will avoid deletion, so I suggest a section on each affiliate station, and a little about the UK student TV scene in general wouldn't go amiss.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 22:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

Right, we now have an infobox and a little more flesh at the start. I've used the 'company' infobox, doesn't quite fit but does the job.temporarily.

To do list:

Categorise the article

Summary of each station

Get rid of the long 'History' table of dates.

Rewrite 'Conference and NaSTA Awards' in encyclopedical style.

Rewrite 'History', or junk it if there's really no reliable information.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 23:25, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

*Cool, agreed.  Maybe we should get a copy of the logo without the purple background too.  As far as the 'summary of each station' goes, I suggest we keep each entry a similar size, include logos wherever possible, and don't mention anything about what awards they've won.

*Good start on the station sections, i've added a couple more. I'm a bit stuck on History - I've rewritten the stuff about Bournemouth a bit, give it some more context, but other than that, there's no info...[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 17:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

*Would it be possible to compile a list of notable former Nasta members? [[User:none|Pete]]
**Well, maybe. But lists tend to get far too long and lower the quality of a page IMO. Plus, we just removed the list of former conferences. Can we remove the list of non-affiliated stations? Technically less than half of the student TV stations in the UK are affiliated right now, because nobody has sent off the fees! And is it really relevant who ''isn't'' in NaSTA? [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 09:28, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
***How about (for the moment) including everyone who was affiliated last year in the main list, and including stations who either did not affiliate last year or have never been affiliated as 'other'. That way we'd catch new stations who intend to affiliate this year on the page, and not leave out some major stations who just haven't got around to posting their cheques yet. I think it is worth giving a short mention to non-NaSTA stations, as there are very few of them.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 11:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

*I've just been reviewing the member station section, and several seem misleading at least compared to there own website or are acting as promotional material. i can see you all care about student tv but i think your ignoring th NPOV policy. also are all these stations still active as several sites have not been updated in some time, Bloomsbury for example doesn't appear to have been updated for several years. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 11:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
**Sure, could you point to a couple of specifics so we know what to avoid? There are non-active stations, I think they should be pruned. Note that non-active website doesn't mean the station is not running, as they aren't all web-based.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 19:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
**In addition, I have just heard (on fairly good authority) that Bloomsbury are alive and well (though their website is broken...)[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 20:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

::: From what i have seen looking throgh the varies websites and googling them WTV and LS:TV are close to a traditional television station, with lots of programmes which are regularly broadcast, several others are however moving in this direction, wheras others resemble filmmakers clubs. Though GUST has a very interesting model basically it just perpetually produces the same shows year on year. i think a good NPOV wold to give a fair represention of the stations volume and diversity of output, but avoid descriptions of services they provide or how they broadcast unless this is particularly different from the norm. are there any third party verifiable sources on the NaSTA and student tv in the UK? since your good sources is hardly verifiable as the last update on the website was 4 years ago so its been broken for all that time. i appreciate they may not all be web based but if there's no website you need to provide some verifiable sources. I think a section on notable alumni would be useful, highlighting a few former members who've gone on to success in the media. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
::::That's fair enough, I think Bloomsbury are pretty close to dead - all I have is word of mouth that Bloomsbury had a committee last year, but that's it. But please don't go merely on the basis of the websites - these are **not** online TV stations, the main method of broadcast is on campus cable-based networks. The best way to judge output is to either watch the station in question, or ask someone who watches/makes the programmes what their output is. It's a bit like asking for a source on the content of a film, you really need to watch the film to say 'that's what happens at the end'. Good sources for Student TV in general are a couple of BBC news articles, a lot of local news coverage and a good few (I've got clippings of five) national newspaper articles. Also, University guides often make mention but are light on detail. Notable alumni would be a good section, it's a question of back-tracing the stations from biographies etc - I've got a couple of them lined up for XTV, but I need some for the other stations too before I add it in.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 21:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::Agreed on the NPOV, but that was bound to happen because folk from the member stations are eager to write their own sections. That kind of thing is easily fixed though. This article has been drastically changed very quickly, so there's bound to be a few problems. Bear with us. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 16:57, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
::::::ontop of the NPOV issues you also seem to have a bit of an edit war between i what i assume are rivals from different stations. is demon the first of these stations in halls, i can't find any sources on that but i can't equally find anything for YSTV claim that they were first. from what i've seen of the websites most station put up what programmes they do, just if i wanted to find out what shows the BBC or ABC make. I appreciate your point, but everything you put on wiki has to be verifiable, so it should at least reflect whats on there own websites.
I have one suggest have you thought about creating your own wiki? then each station, show etc could have its own page, you could design it on the IMDB lines. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:35, 03 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::::I simply removed demon from saying that they are the first to broadcast in halls. I am not saying that YSTV was the first, I just know it to be factually incorrect as we have broadcast to halls for longer. As far as I know, I don't need a citation to prove that someting without a citation is false. I am just trying to keep the article factually accurate, not having an edit war - sorry demon :) [[User:Ystv|Ystv]] 02:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

==Founding Members==
who are the founding members of the organisation, the earliest website on archive.org was for december 96, however its listed as Nasta 95, and the member stations then were, BTV, CTV, GUST, GTV, LUST, Nexus, STOIC, YSTV.are these the found members?
:Probably not, those are most likely the affiliates at the time of the website being written. The actual formation is some time in the 1970s - I've seen some archive footage of a very informal NaSTA conference from that era - but in true student style, no-one thought to write it down and keep records.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 11:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

::I believe it goes back as far as 1969; the earliest student TV stations seem to date back to about 1967 (YSTV, possibly GUST?) and 1968 (GTV, Nexus). My notes on past NaSTA conferences say &quot;1969 ? Sussex, 1970 ? Plymouth&quot; but I have no idea where that information came from, other than from old newsletters in the NaSTA file in the GTV &quot;office&quot; in about 1997. It does suggest that there were stations in those places at around the time that NaSTA was founded. I also have a fairly solid list of 1980s/90s conferences if anyone's interested. --[[User:Rbrwr|rbrwr]][[User talk:Rbrwr|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;plusmn;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:37, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

==Name==
What does NaSTA actually stand for?

:'''Na'''tional '''S'''tudent '''T'''elevision '''A'''ssociation - I think the 'a' from National is added in to make a pronouncable word, rather than 'NSTA' which is kind of hard to say.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 11:40, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Article Quality ==
Just had a look over the article other than a few g&amp;s mistakes, and few stations POV pushes, it looks good you should be proud. The only changes i think you need, would be to add blurbs for the other affiliated stations. Other than that well done! [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 06:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

== The current holders of Best Broadcaster for 2007 / 2008 are LS:TV ==

Surely LS:TV are the best broadcaster 2006-2007, as 2007-2008 hasn't been awarded yet. They have been awarded for their production in the last year, not what they're going to produce.

--[[User:Peternewman|Peternewman]] 16:55, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

==Station Articles==
Despite the round of deletions a few months back, some stations have either still got articles (GUST, LooseTV), or have new articles (XTV). None of the deleted stations have had articles re-created. 

These articles were not linked from the NaSTA page, so I've done them using the 'Main article' notation. By the way, I did not create or edit the XTV article, and I'm going to abstain on saying whether it should exist.

Please do not create advertisement or un notable articles its damages wikipedia. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 15:55, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with you on that, and I'm all for removing non-notable articles. I see [[GUST]] and [[XTV]] have been redirected to [[NaSTA]]. One point is that [[GUST]] was recently kept after an AFD debate, and that article contained quite a lot of information which is not present in the NaSTA article. As such, I don't believe it should be redirected.

:If any of the member stations have their own articles, surely they should be linked from the NaSTA page that mentions them. If the member station articles should not exist, surely they should go through the normal process for deletion?[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 18:30, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

an AfD would remove the page i am currently of the mind that they are useful as redirected and given the improved quality of this article it is more than capable of carry GUST information in a single paragraph without need for a forked article, {GUST programmes etc are not notable} however i coming to increasingly believe that all the less notable stations should be rolled into on general section since they're are essential the same thing at different unis there is no real need for a {seperate in places quite POV} section on each [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 01:20, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

==rewrite and possible re name==
I'm think more and more that this article should be rewritten, to actually explain how student tv in the UK is made rather than rattle off a list of station that basically do the same thing with differing degrees of success at different university. Also possibly renamed to student tv in the uk with a section on nasta as there appears to be as many student tv station out of nasta as in it, so its hardly representative of student tv in the UK as a whole. though i am finding it difficult to find any current notable sources without which it maybe the whole article should be deleted or cut down to what is actually verifible. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 05:41, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:Seems fairly reasonable, but I think there is an underlying problem with a lack of consensus and bad edits. Re-directing GUST is at risk of turning in to an edit war, which would be bad. Every now and again we get a POV-push from particular member stations (most recently in LUST). Sources are problematic, true, and although we have enough secondary sources to establish some notability, we can't justify every single statement in the article with out turning to a primary source i.e stations themselves. We also have an issue in that some sources are print media only.

:The concern with removing the station sections is that without the NaSTA article, stations will want their own article (and I believe many stations are on the fringes of notability), and we'll have a continuous stream of AFDs and no consensus. Can I lay out some alternatives?

:1. The status quo, which I understand to be articles on major stations (GUST), NaSTA article linking to them and sections on each station in the NaSTA article.
:2. Article called 'UK student TV', with a section on NaSTA, and station sections merged in to their relevant Student's Unions articles and major stations that have been [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Glasgow_University_Student_Television|kept by consensus]] to have their own articles, linked from all relevant articles.
:3.Articles on every single station plus NaSTA itself
:4. No articles on UK student TV at all.

:Myself, I'm happy with the status quo and as such I'm going to leave this article well alone for the immediate future. I'm also going to suggest that others do the same, and that JMalky and Sherzo take a break from editing this particular article for a while to avoid any rash edits, whilst we try and build a consensus between us ''before'' making any major changes. [User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 09:22, 1 June 2007 (UTC) -&gt;edited later to clarify, previously sounded like an (unintended)attack on JMalky and Sherzo.

I don't think any of the stations individually are notable, as a collective they're notable it the same way that youtube is notable but its individual users aren't. However i think the article misrepresents what Nasta, it lacks sources, and there as many UK student tv station outside it as inside. i think if the article was changed to focusing on student tv the history development and notable people who have been involved in student tv. A section on Nasta , but i don't think each station needs its own section since other than locality very little changes between station in terms of programming or style. out of the options 2 is the probably the best though in regards to merging the individuals stubs i doubt there notable to be on such pages as for GUST it was kept by consensus however the article does not reference its one claim on notability and lacks any information on its history and simple use the unsubstantiated claim of being first as a way to shoehorn an article on the current station and its programming rather that why being first makes it notable. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 05:00, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

:Believe it or not I agree with Sherzo. I'd much rather that the NaSTA article be converted into a 'UK Student Television' article. It does seem to make a lot more sense. There's been a bit of confusion about what NaSTA's role is and the article is a bit misleading. I think this happened because various users (myself included) were bigging it up a little when it was up for deletion. But I think those people who were in favour of keeping the article were more concerned that UK Student TV have a place on Wikipedia, rather than NaSTA per se. So good idea, Tomisaac. As for wether or not individual stations should have their own articles, maybe that could be decided by formally putting the GUST article up for deletion, and using the resulting debate as a sort of precident? [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 15:00, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

I think an overall article would be both more representative and easy to research &amp; verify. on the matter of precedent though i feel its better every article be judged individually, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/LUST is the already used precedent. I have put a request for comment to get more input. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 02:37, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Ok, so are we doing a re-write or not? [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 14:37, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

Since you have better access to material, can i suggest you and tomisaac start [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 05:58, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

*I do agree that turning the article into one about student TV would make for a more encyclopaedic article, so long as it did not become a [[WP:NOT#DIRECTORY|directory]]. It will never stop students from individual universities from creating articles on their station, nor putting POV edits into this one, so the article would need to be watched to ensure that all statements and assertions are [[WP:RS|sourced]]. Unsourced statements would be challenged, and then deleted if not [[WP:V|verified]]. If non-notable stations wanted a bit more latitude, unsourced items could arguably be part of the university article - that's not to say that [[WP:V]] or [[WP:NPOV]] should be ignored. [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] 10:30, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
* I'm up for a rewrite, but I won't be able to start for a while as I am very busy in the 'real world' at the moment. Is there any mechanism for starting rewriting a page in non-main-namespace (user talk pages?) before it is ready to replace the original page? It would seem a shame to redirect NaSTA and all the station pages to 'Student Television in the UK' before we have any decent content.
:* It's done all the time. You can create an article within your own userspace without the constrains of a public article. For instance, you may create one called [[User:Tomisaac/British student television]], work on it (even in collaboration) there, and then move it to a suitable namespace, such as [[British student television]]. Only at that stage do we need to think about what to do with the [[NaSTA]] article. [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] 01:50, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
**Do what I do and write while you're meant to be working. :D Actually, yeah, I'm busy too. But I'm sure we'll get round to it in good time. I'm more worried about settling the GUST debate at the moment anyway. As for starting the new page, I suppose we could use this talk page as a sandbox. And of course, we don't really have to delete/re-direct the NaSTA article until the new page is of a decent standard, provided we do it reasonably quickly. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 15:56, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

I would agree that the this article shouldn't be removed until a new was is suuficiently developed, since i am relatively unbusy if you'd like to provide me with any useful resources on constructing this article, i could have a go at writing a first draft [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 19:14, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

I propose that the page is moved to [[Student television in the United Kingdom]]. Firsty, the ''Manual of Style'' states clearly ''Do not capitalize second and subsequent words unless the title is a proper noun''. Secondly using the adjective ''British'' probably isn't a good idea as the page includes Northern Irish student television - using ''in the United Kingdom'' avoids this problem. It would also bring the article name in line with the bold text in the lead paragraph. Are there any objections? [[User:CR7|CR7]] 21:17, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

actually it includes a republic of Ireland station, so the term British was used since they are all part of that archopeligo. perhaps you should try reading the article first next time [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:36, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

CR7 is right here I'm afraid. It is culturally unacceptable to citizens of both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland to include an Irish university television station in an article entitled British student television. The term [[British]] is associated with Empire and especially England to which the Republic of Ireland is not part of. I think by referring this article as British you really mean pertaining to the [[British Isles]], the ''actual'' and ''acceptable name'' of the group of islands. Something a teacher ''should'' be aware of. Therefore, a more appropriate title would be [[Student television in the British Isles]] [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 07:25, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

Well since the term British refers to the British Isles and not any of the nations, England, English, Scotland Scottish, Wales, Welsh and Ireland Irish. since the name was acceptable to Jmalky, Tominsaac and CTN the Irish nation in question. I am aware that some Irish people have a bigotry against the British and i raised this very question when the page was in development since even the term British isles is offensive to these people, however since the British and Irish government always use the term these Isles and the only other option is Islands of the North Atlantic which includes Iceland and Greenland it was decided it would be pedantic and over confusing especially since the only Irish station wanted to be included with the British ones and even joined the british group Nasta

as for your other point Ireland was part of the UK and its Irish troops made up a third of the military, and several Irishmen were prime minister including field marshal wellington, perhaps you should stick to science rather than try and lecture on history. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 11:02, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

Regardless of British referring to 'the British Isles', the island of Ireland (both the Republic and Northern Ireland) are most definately not part of (Great) Britain, which includes only England, Wales and Scotland.. In response to &quot;perhaps you should try reading the article&quot;, I did read the article and thought it meant Northern Ireland due to the fact the title said British. I don't know if you're British, but I know 100% that I am. 'British' is a very touchy term in Ireland as a whole and only Northern Ireland is ever referred to as being British in any sense. Calling this article ''British'' Student Television is not geographically or politically correct. I suggest therefore that [[Student television in the United Kingdom and Ireland]] or [[Student television in Britain and Ireland]] are good substitutes. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 11:34, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

Just as an extra, the suggestion that we should use 'British Isles' is a bit sketchy as well according to [[British Isles naming dispute]]. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 11:36, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

i'm glad your a 100% sure of your own nationality. you thought it meant northern ireland despite saying Dublin? don't they teach geography in the UK anymore? outside of fringe of vocal lunatics on the internet the british isles is an oft use term in the rest of the world, and since this article was designed to replace the Nasta one if you had joined ino on the development of this article or done some research you'll see that it isn't a seperate cultures its one culture of student television that grew in Britain and spread to Ireland its be like saying Disney is now a franco-American company because it opened eurodisney, and further to any of that CTN what to be included with the British, they joined the the UK's National Association of Student Television rather than start an Irish one. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 14:56, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

This is nothing to do with culture, it's to do with the name of the article! The Republic of Ireland is most certainly not Britain or British. According to the page history you are the only person that's edited it and it was full of spelling and grammatical mistakes. Please don't insult British geography if you can't use capital letters properly. This is an encyclopedia, not a blog. The article should be what is geographically correct and politically correct - calling it British Student Television is not acceptable. The page will need renaming regardless as it's against Wikipedia policy - ''student'' and ''television'' shouldn't have capital letters - [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions#Lowercase second and subsequent words in titles|see here]]. Wikipedia also promotes a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view policy]] and describing Ireland as British is ''not'' neutral. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 15:54, 4 August 2007 (UTC)


I'm really suprised at the level of ignorance and poor judgement that [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] has demonstrated here. The rather disappointing way that this article was created.

Firstly as the debate on the original [[Glasgow University Student Television]] had gone quiet, but by no means reached a consensus (with the exception of what [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] concidered credible print sources in the UK). The opportunity was taken to create this article and push the GUST article under the carpet. The only person who even mentioned the possibility of creating such an article in this debate was in fact [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]].

Secondly, and a major sticking point for me in any debate on the use of language in wikipedia, is ''International editors not understanding the consequences of the use of certain phrases in creation or editing articles''. I'm constantly baffled why international editors have the need to impress themselves on articles for the only reason that it doesn't fit their particular interpretation on the guidelines regarding notability, or what wikipedia is not. I understand that there is a wide range of interpretations from the hard core deletionist, to the hard core inclusionist. However. Editing an article that is removed from their national and influential sphere, not as it is their interest or expertease, but as a jobsworth for the rules, to me is becoming more and more unacceptable.

Finally is the tone that [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] has used in this debate, inferring that his knowledge is superior to us meer mortals. The same mortals who live in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, who have to deal with these issues on a day to day basis.

[[User:CR7|CR7]], the original source of this article can be found [[User:Tomisaac/British_Student_Television/|here]].If you examine the talk section you will see the limited level of consultation over the use of the term [[British]], and the rather good and unused suggestion by [[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] to use [[Student Television in the UK and Ireland]] instead (Incidentally, his whole contribution to the debate there). [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 20:23, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

first let me deal with your point about the terrible editing of international editors and how they have zero knowledge of anything that happens in the UK etc. First International editors are a good thing since they have no Bias i have no desire to make Student TV in  the UK look good or bad just represent it honestly and informatively, if more non biased editing took place on many US articles wiki would be a better place. An example  of the benefits of non bias editors can been seen on the article this replace. the Nasta page misrepresented what nasta was in an effort to increase its notability so was misleading the individual stations had all edited the page in such a way that it would appear they were all superior to the BBC and practically perfect in every possible way. I edited that article as i edited this based on research as best i could achieve it from my inferior nations, but rather than using your instanteous knowledge of all things uk to improve this article what have you done what subistantive contribution have you made? its editors like you that bog wikipedia down in the munsha and why i have grown weary of constantly battle editors whos sole objective is to stamp there own world view.

as to the matter of the name the article is about the culture of student tv in Britain primarily the Irish in general and CTN in particularly have made no contribution to that as yet and CTN itself is of no note as none of the stations are other than through its connect to that British Culture since it petitioned to join Nasta it would not be eligible in any other way, and to rename the article to reflect that one station joined a British student association would be entirely misrepresentative of the article unless you were to add substantionally ammounts on the contribution of Irish Student tv i assume via your omnipotent knowledge of all things british and irish but then that would mean adhering to the spirit of wikipedia by acutally research and then contribution something, rather than make pedantic arguments based on your world view and how wiki should reflect that. 

If you feel that agrieved by the name put in an RfC i was only trying to improve wikipedia foolish for me even to try, but one thing all the month this article was in development with your vast knowledge of all things british you didn't make a single solitary contribution

[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 20:59, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for that link TorstenGuise. On the NaSTA article front, there are now millions of double redirects to this page from the NaSTA one even though the two aren't quite the same, so something needs fixing there. Regardless of the culture, Ireland still remains seperate from Britain and the name '''must''' reflect that, it's wikipedia policy for neutral descriptions. The article name is entirely unacceptable and I'm glad that I'm not the first to consider the naming of this article. We have the following possibilities: [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]], [[Student television in the Britain and Ireland]], [[Student television in the UK and RoI]] and the expanded forms. Rather than argue about whether or not the rename is necessary, it'd be better to choose one of the options and to get on with it. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 21:06, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

Your welcome [[User:CR7|CR7]]. Personally I prefer [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]]. Snappy and to the point. Returning briefly to my grievance on international editors. The internet is not the only source of information in the world, something International editors tend to rely on when working on articles such as this. The internet is also not the most reliable source of information either. I certainly would not use the vast majority (if any) of it's content when compiling a research paper. So whereas there would be some bias from a local editor, there would also be bias from an international editor due to the limited, and not nessesarily reliable relevant subject matter available on the internet. This also impacts on the honest opinion of the subject matter that the international editor sees. There goes the NPoV from the international editor theory out the window.

Finally, I could not contribute to the development of this article, as I was not aware of it until it appeared magically in place of the GUST article. I only found the source after [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] had indicated yesterday that the work was developed by [[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] and [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] on my talk page. It's interesting how there is a gap of over a month of inactive editing, yet little publicity on the other relevant topics. You must expect some criticism when an article is being created in relative secrecy, then try to defend yourself by asking where is your input. I'm not saying I'm an expert on British &amp; Irish culture either, or have an instentaneous knowledge of all things UK. I'm meerly pointing out the basic fact from being here that we know stuff you don't! [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 21:50, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

have you put in a RfC yet? is it because then you would be unable to try and stamp your own world view on the article?

you claim i'm so evil for using the internet to research and improve an article that i couldn't know have to made one edit base on the information you can access from acutally living there? no you've complained about the title, you are in fact what is wrong with wikipedia perhaps you'd feel more at home on conservapedia more your style. As for developed in secret thats just hiliarious i would of been more than grateful i frequently requested in fact on the Nasta talk page, i uploaded it preciously because no one had many any editions in so long, the Nasta page couldn't be left as it was, but its not by responsibility to get you involved you get yourself involved if you can't be bothered how is that my fault? 

This is an article that represents the growing culture of student tv in the Britain for the name to include Ireland would lead you believe that Ireland has had some impact on this cultural it has not, its simple a note in this article because an Irish station petition to join a British student tv group its utterly insane pedantic and misleading to include Ireland in the title.

on the matter of international editors, yes we are all so retard we are unable to make intelligent judgements on what we read or identify a reliable source because we all lack the superior british brain. you yourself have edited articles on other countries do you really feel your competent to write about Korea? given how you live in Britain or does this rule solely apply to the UK? because were all lower orders of lifeforms compared to the British? Wikipedia acutally preferes web sources, to prevent articles like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hanger65/Upper_Peninsula_War| upper peninsular war] so that anyone check them, rather than having to wait till some neutral person from that country haps along and has both the time and energy to go and check them references in the article, that is why we have a notability standard, to guard against such bias. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 11:09, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

i removed to reference to Ireland i hope that makes you happy, perhaps you could now attempt some substantive contribution to wikipedia [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 11:09, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

I haven't claimed you are evil for using the internet for research, I meerly critisised the credibility of the internet as a reliable reference resource. You can read about national cultures all you want, but living the culture is very different. It gives you a differing knowledge. I didn't get dragged into this subject until the GUST debate, to which there is no real reference to this on there. Being pedantic about national politics is actually important to the UK &amp; RoI. I never suggested that we were superior in intellect or knowledge, you did. If you check the history of the [[Radio jamming in Korea]] article, you will note that I made the second edit to the article and marked it for speedy deletion. Well within my rights as a newpage patroller. The notability standard, like all rules on wikipedia is open to very wide interpretation. Something that differs significantly from the inclusionist to the deletionist. As for your suggestion that I should be editing Conservapedia, I couldn't be more against the principles of such a restrictive environment of knowledge. Remember, I'm a '''scientist'''.  [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 12:26, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

This has nothing to do with being pedantic, Ireland is not part of Britain - '''fact'''. Calling the Irish British is like calling the Americans British; they were British in the past, but not anymore and don't like to be called that way. I am in no way encouraging restrictive information but making a correction to what is factually inaccurate. I'll see what I can do for an RfC. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 13:13, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

It appears that the main article is already down for RfC, since 29 July. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 13:18, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

There seem to be three issues here. The capitalisation is the easy one, it should be fixed. Then there's the question of whether ''[[British student television|British student television]]'' is preferred to ''[[Student television in the UK|Student television in the UK]]'', and so on. I can't get excited about that, either is fine. But the question of Ireland fascinates me... at present there seems to be no mention at all of Ireland in the article, so why have it in the title? Why not instead create a stub on [[Irish student television|Irish student television]] or [[Student television in Ireland|Student television in Ireland]] or something similar? [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 07:17, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

There '''was''' a mention of Ireland, but Sherzo removed it so that the argument to rename the page would become null and void in his opinion. If you look on the main page's history and go back to the last version I edited, you'll see where it was mentioned. From what it appears that is the only student TV station in Ireland, so the stub would be pretty pointless, including it back here under the title [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]]. If the Ireland section grew, it could be spun off; but if it remains as only the one station it'd be fine in with the rest. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 13:14, 6 August 2007 (UTC)


I've only just noticed this page has been copied over from the corner of my userspace where it was being worked on. To be honest, I made the stub of the article, and around the same time I ended up reading a few comments that had been made by others (who shall remain nameless) working on the original NaSTA article in other articles. I found the attitude to discussion so uncivil and childishly argumentative that I decided I wasn't going to risk working with them, and I left the article alone. My original plan had been to get a bit more structure in, advertise the rewrite heavily on [NaSTA]] and [[GUST]] talk pages (and message individuals) and then move it over if there was consensus. I didn't really intend a secret rewrite (as I think was mentioned above somewhere), but after I stopped working on it I decided not to bother advertising it too much.

I reckon the best name is probably [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]] - it is both accurate (grammatically and geographically) and short. It uses instantly recognisable short-form names of both countries. We could also use 'ROI' for Ireland - this is a term that I have only seen used infrequently, at least inside the UK. It may cause confusion if used in the article heading.
The only title with comparable accuracy is [[Student television in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland]], which I feel is cumbersome to say the least...
I suggest the scope of the article should include both Ireland and the UK because at the moment the two countries share NaSTA, and NaSTA is a significant part of the student television scene.

One thing I still can't understand is how any discussion on UK Student TV subjects on wikipedia ends up in a finger-pointing, name-calling slanging match (and don't any of you say 'But he started it!', and I'm not referring to this debate on it's own, there's a LOT of it in the archives!). It's a relatively uncontroversial subject which has a few good sources, and it's only significant issue is the occasional person coming along and using the encyclopaedia to self-promote - but those are easily dealt with. As such, I'm out of this one - I'm only going to make spelling and grammar edits to the articles if I feel like it from now on. Have fun guys![[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 14:35, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

Right then, I'm '''in favour''' of [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]]. TorstenGuise also suggested his support to that title earlier here too. What are other people's views? In favour or against? [[User:CR7|CR7]] 15:18, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

Not merely suggesting it It has my full support. I've replaced the articles references to Ireland  to re-enforce that. [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 17:17, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

the reference to Ireland, which i did inform you i had remove, is an aside it bears no relevance to the article, as the Irish station and thus Ireland has had no influences on that culture and any influence it did have would be within the British tradition as already established, we not call hollywood films anglo american despite the huge influence British culture and actors writers directers etc have had on it, similiar British cultural tradition previous have had Irish and American contributors, Byron, TS Eliot, George Bernard Shaw yet we still regard them as british. so any mention of ireland in the title without substanstive evidence would be misleading for anyone trying to research it just as the Nasta article had been.

the Irish question aside, why do you feel student television in the UK would be superior the current one
do either of you intend to make actually contributions to the article with your encyclopedic knowledge of all things British? for instances you could fact check that guinness book of records reference.

[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 18:31, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

Once again, the title is nothing to do with the culture. Everyone but you has seen the title needs changing. When this is settled I intend to try and put some work into the article; however at the moment my main priority is sorting out templates as part of the WikiSchools project. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 22:39, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

explain for us inferior non brits then? why is Student Television in the UK better than British student television? [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 06:55, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

I think we have haven't we? What is it that they say about America &amp; Britain? Two nations separated by the same language! [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 08:09, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

yet again with the insults rather than reasoned arguments, doing your nation proud you truly are, you have yet to present one reasoned argument why British student television is an inferior title to Student Television in the UK, rather than your petulent and petty attacks on non brits. American articles are frequently called that american rather than in the united states, so what exactly is your argument for this far less &quot;snappy&quot; title is just change for change sake or just to try prove something to be pedantic because we have disagreed on other articles? i give yourself a victory for your ego perhaps? if so wiki really isn't the place but if it will improve your personal happiness if your life is that depressingly sad then by all means do it. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 18:00, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

Once again, calling it British Student Television is politically AND geographically incorrect. [[User:CR7|CR7]] 23:24, 7 August 2007 (UTC)
:Is anyone apart from Sherzo '''objecting''' to the renaming of the article [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]]? [[User:CR7|CR7]] 00:00, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

As a member of CTN, I'm all in favour of calling the page [[Student television in the UK and Ireland]].  As well as the political and geographical reasons outlined above, the main reason for approving of this new title is in consideration of NaSTA.  The NaSTA constitution was amended in March 2007 to include any student television stations in the Republic of Ireland who wish to be included.  True, as yet, there is only the one, CTN, but the door is now open for others.  

What concerns me is the repercussions of having no separate NaSTA Wikipedia article.  Since entering NaSTA into the search box redirects the searcher to this article, that implies that all topics relevant to NaSTA will be covered, or at least have the potential to be covered in this article.  Actively excluding Ireland from the article does not faithfully represent the current state of student television in the UK.  

--[[User:Jazzypants|Jazzypants]] 17:38, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

and what cultural contribution has CTN made to student television in the British Isles? CTN inclusion is trivia at this point nothing more, like mentioning Canada in an article primarily about the US no one would say it should be renamed. on the nasta issue it wasn't notable for its own page just as CTN isn't notable and certainly not notable enough to change the name of this article.

also i know students in the UK have a prepensity to to create sockpuppets and will just say that is not the way to reach consenus wikipedia is not a democracy and this not a vote.

i like how CR7 and TortenGuise have no acutally arguments for there proposed change just the fact i'm against. if you simply presented your arguments for the change succiently and clearly you may convince me to change my mind. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 19:22, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

To be quite frank, so far the only person that has objected is Sherzo. Everyone else has embraced the concept openly. Unless there are any other objections then there is a clear concensus to rename the page. '''[[User:CR7|CR7]]''' ([[User talk:CR7|message me]]) 20:12, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

The articles held within Wickipedia are more than a record of cultural contributions alone: it gives ''information'' of many types on many subjects.  I disagree with your analogy of the US and Canada.  When people wish to talk about the US and mention Canada, they talk of North America.  There is no point in excluding one when there is a term covering both.  Although there is no accepted corresponding term in this case, 'the UK and Ireland', as stated above, is a geographically and politically accurate phrase in the circumstances.

Furthermore, the UK and Ireland have a unique relationship within Europe and arguably the world.  Although two distinct countries, there are many formal and tacit agreements that ease relations between them.  Many societies and institutions operate under the UK and Ireland banner.  

I understand that you wish this article to be about student television within the UK.   What I do not understand is ''why'' this article must be about UK student television ''alone''.  I think that it is right to mention student television in Ireland in this article (reasons: because student television in Ireland should be mentioned somewhere, and including it here will foster good relations within the community and give it a broader context; because NaSTA caters for stations in both countries (see below); because of the proximity of our countries and the unique relationship they have), and if that is to be done, then the title must reflect this.  As has been mentioned previously in this discussion, to talk of Ireland without differentiating it from the UK is inflammatory and non-neutral.  

As a brief aside, although new to the student television scene, I have observed that NaSTA is indeed notable in that it garners a lot of attention from both student and professional quarters.  The longer it has been established, the more people within the industry will come from a NaSTA background, the more notable NaSTA will become.  It is important to nurture these links.  Disregarding something, whether it be NaSTA or CTN, because it is deemed insignificant by one faction will only serve to alienate some and leave others in the dark.  It is in all our interests to encourage discussion of and dissemination of information surrounding ''all'' student television stations in these islands.

--[[User:Jazzypants|Jazzypants]] 20:38, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

I have no problem mentioning student television in Ireland, however it should not be in the title as this would be misleading, it would make it appear that Ireland has played some part in this culture which it has yet to do.
you say not to differate is non neutral but to tailor wiki to individual tastes is not neutral in the same way wiki disregards the tastes of Muslims by not putting pbuh after the name muhammad and having images of on his page similiar the page on Evolution is not tailored to meet the tastes of a few individuals, Wiki is a research tool for the population of the entire world.

Wiki has guidelines on notability and Nasta doesn't fulfill them student tv in the UK as a whole does there is a growing culture but more UK stations exist outside of Nasta than in it, and sources on nasta are poor at best as with many of the older stations. it gets significant mention in this article and you should feel free to expand just make sure its relevant sources are attached.

however wiki is not the place to nurture links or anything else to provide people with a resource material, and the fact Nasta might become important in the future is not a valid reason for an article it could equally disappear. wikipedia is not a place to advertise or promote your group and this is why we have notability and NPOV.

if you can provide evidence of the contribution of irish student tv on an equal level to that of British stations in a combined culture then i will support the name change. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 00:23, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' Student TV in Britain has been going for more than 40 years with dozens of stations from scotland to plymouth exeter to wales, in contrast its only been going in Ireland for a less than a year with one station, also CTN is not a part of Nasta, the door has been opened for it to join in the next academic year if it chooses to. Given the nature of student tv as with any student group CTN could well disappear next year whereas in Britain its a pretty safe bet based on the number and age of stations that it will keep going. This article shows the rightly proud history of Student TV in Britain ( not to mention what we can achieve on such small budgets) so the title should reflect that. Personally i feel the Nasta Article and all the station articles should be restored to represent this vibrant and growing field of media.

===Discussion===
:''Any additional comments:''

The rename is not the basic issue. There's a long-standing battle here as to whether Irish student television should be included in this article or not, and that's not surprising considering the subject, and not likely to cease as a result of a rename. 

Either approach would do. My hunch is that we have more chance of a lasting peace with two articles, one for the UK and the other for Ireland. But either way, any decision on the name is pointless unless it also reflects a strong consensus on this issue. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 01:58, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

Student Tv in Ireland is yet to be notable and there is simple no real article to write, if there is an article on Irish Tv then i guess a sentence could be added to that. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 09:55, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

This is nothing to do with pride, it's to do with geographical and political fact, Ireland '''is not''' part of Great Britain and as such it should be mentioned in the name.

===Discussion===
:''Any additional comments:''

The rename is not the basic issue. There's a long-standing battle here as to whether Irish student television should be included in this article or not, and that's not surprising considering the subject, and not likely to cease as a result of a rename. 

Either approach would do. My hunch is that we have more chance of a lasting peace with two articles, one for the UK and the other for Ireland. But either way, any decision on the name is pointless unless it also reflects a strong consensus on this issue. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 01:58, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

Student Tv in Ireland is yet to be notable and there is simple no real article to write, if there is an article on Irish Tv then i guess a sentence could be added to that. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 09:55, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

This is nothing to do with pride, it's to do with geographical and political fact, Ireland '''is not''' part of Great Britain and as such it should be mentioned in the name. The is no inference that Irish student TV is better than English, Welsh or Scottish student TV. '''[[User:CR7|CR7]]''' ([[User talk:CR7|message me]]) 13:01, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

the fact is you are wanting to change the entire name of an article over a trival aside, the article is about student tv in the UK with a brief mention of an Irish station, which isn't even part of nasta apparantly (perhaps someone who lives in the UK can fact check that you know how incapable us non brits are) so its following in the tradition of its british counsins but has yet to add anything to that culture, and may not even exist next year, so will the title become periodical changing with the whims of irish students?

Hello.  Just a suggestion, but I reckon the GUST wikipedia page should probably not include:

* Details of current editors
* Lists of awards
* Lots of technical babble

[[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 17:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

current editors is unencyclopedic. notible gusties of old would be good. some technical stuff is interesting probably limit to original broadcast methods and brief idea of current technology.

Lists suck. the 7 years in a row winnig of nasta doesnt though interesting awards stuff should be kept no need for a full list though. imo --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] 19:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

The history section includes a lot of techy stuff. Could be expanded a little. Who put in the thing about the GUST Sport theme tune BTW? Is that really vital information? [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 11:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

I recommend this be merged the main article is strong enough now that there is no real argument for any station to keep a seperate article. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 04:41, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

since there's no real objection i merge it. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:13, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Aye on yersel Sherzo. Or wait a min &quot;This article was nominated for deletion on 16 November, 2006. The result of the discussion was KEEP.&quot;

If anyone wants this page deleted/merged, be nice and discuss it here or elsewhere first. JMalky 08:53, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

First its not really done to reformat other people's comments, so i have restored them, second i did has you not over a month before you reverted it, so accusing me of not discuss it is a flatout lie. third this isn't notable enough to have its own forked article from the [[Nasta]] one. fourth i will assume that like [[wongch2]] you are a member of nasta and would remind you that self promotion is prohibited you should wait till someone else writes an article about you since its shows your actually notable. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 05:18, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:Apologies for moving your comments, I was just trying to keep everything in the same place. Could you have a look at the old AfD debate? We fought hard for this article and convinced everyone that the station is indeed notable, given it's long history and the fact that it is the oldest student TV station in the UK, and oldest student-run station in the ''world''. The NaSTA page does not contain sufficient information. If you still feel that the page isn't worthwhile, then could you nominate it for deletion? Surely it's better to do this by consensus. Can I also point out that I'm not a member of NaSTA, and that at any rate self promotion is not prohibited at all. It's just frowned upon. There's not meant to be any rules around here! [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 12:12, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

I appreciate your apology. 
i have just read the AfD, the first at the time the Nasta article was in such a poor state that it could be justifiable because notable facts may be lost, this however is no longer the case the article has increased immensely in terms of quality to the point that forking out individual station articles is no longer justified. second in the debate you say there are many source yet the article only has one incestious reference no external 3rd party reliable or even verifible sources, as such it has failed to live up to one of the arguments for the keep. i did a quick google check and pretty much every result in reference to this station was either one relating to the university of glasgow or a mirror of this. third i would also debate your claim that it is a TV station since the university itself lists it as a club[http://www.gla.ac.uk/studentinformation/studentgroups/clubs/] and i would remind that college club have to be of [[Cambridge Footlights]] calibur to be notable. further your entire argument of notability is based on the fact it was first, one do you have a single 3rd party source to back this up. Two why does this make it notable were they pioneers? as someone had to be first among the nasta stations why does it entitle you to your own article.

lastly wikipedia does have rules so as to make it a useful tool to everyone in the world. and the self promotion rule is a good measure of notability since if someone not involved feels your notable then that the first criteria to proving it is. So just to be clear you are not nor have you ever been a member of GUST? [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 20:25, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, I was a member of GUST when I was at university. I completely admit that the notability of the station is borderline, but then the criteria for 'notability' aren't unanimously agreed upon, are they? This isn't really the place for a debate about deletionism vs inclusionism, but I'd emplore you to give this article, and others like it, the benefit of the doubt. Student television is a field that's growing at an exponential rate (I can certainly show you 3rd party material to back that claim up!), and within that field GUST's notability is unquestionable. I'm sorry but I disagree with your point on the NaSTA article. I think it's still pretty poor. But more importantly, I think you misunderstand the relationship between GUST and NaSTA. NaSTA is not a governing body which GUST is subordinate to, rather it's an organisation it happens to be a member of. To say that the GUST article should be subsumed by the NaSTA article is like saying that the University of Glasgow article should be subsumed by the article for the lecturers union. It just doesn't follow. But at any rate, my arguments for keeping the article are first, its notability as the first of it's kind. Second, its incredible sucess in national competitions over the years. Third, the relatively recent decision in an AfD debate to keep it (which I know doesn't save the article forever, but it should be considered). And finally, its quality, which I think has to count for something. I can't provide you with any 3rd party sources that'd meet your criteria, and yes, my prior involement with the station has to be taken into account. If you'd still rather the page be deleted, I'd prefer that it be judged through a proper AfD debate, rather than your opinion vs mine. Agreed? [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 10:34, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

:: I think collectively student tv is notable but individually i doubt any of them would qualify. the point on Nasta do you have a source? since it certainly presents itself as the governing body as it has a constitution and the general tone with which it describes itself. Also if this is the case then why are there all those stubs on each station within the page? your comment on the lecturer's union is a strawman, more accurate would be to say the Glasgow U article be absorb into an article on universities in the UK. Do you have a source on it being the first? or is that just station/college lore? can you name the founder?. This incredible success is this at anything but Nasta? and if so how does this make you more notable than any other station which have won awards at Nasta. you also ascertain its quality but this simple isn't the case,unless you could show some greater influence, such as notable former members like the university Newspaper. In the article as it was it talks about the station now and its un notable shows, rather its should explain about its history its development the way it produces television and any influence this has had. Now do you have anything that GUST was the first or that it so notable within the student TV or the wider TV community. The article didn't cite any sources. I prefer to merge it since then it would still redirect to the nasta page, but if you are right about Nasta, i may well rewrite the article on Nasta to one on Student TV on the UK and if you could provide sources on GUST that i could use for the History section i would appreciate it.

==Re-write==
I've re-written a large portion of the article. It has a few more references now, and is of a far more appropriate length.

[[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 14:05, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

it certain alot better, though i'm not crazy about your sources as the independent one carries alot of information that is flatout wrong and strikes me as pep piece either a verbatim copy off nasta the old wiki pages or individual website fronts, i have tried looking for other source yet have come up completely empty, [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/scotland/scotland.htm] doesn't mention it nor does the BBC or any other history of TV in the UK or Scotland. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 09:05, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

:Yeah, I know those sources aren't great but I'm afraid that's all I could find, and I had a really thorough search. At least the article is sourced to some extent now. I'm not sure that your link to The Museum of Broadcast Communications is particularly relevant though. Is it a definative source? I would say the lack of mention in UK/Scottish sources is more damaging for the article's notability! But at any rate, I think the article is as good as it's going to get. Wether it's good enough or not, we shall see. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 10:09, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

the point was for it not to be notable enough to be listed in a page on the history of scottish broadcasting or recieve any mention from the bbc on its pioneer status makes its notable dubious at best [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 06:37, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Well I disagree! Of course the station is not notable enough to be listed with national broadcasters. But it doesn't follow that it's not notable enough for wikipedia! There is a middle ground, surely. I don't think we're getting anywhere here though, we've both made our points. That notability tag has been up for a while now and we still have no third opinion. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 09:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
:*I believe that, in terms of content and flow, the article is miles better than it was when the AfD was closed: unencyclopaedic content about the different programs etc has been removed. It would seem that, although the station would theoretically pass WP:N (the first in UK, plus winning the &quot;Nasties&quot;), I would echo [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]]'s concern is that there are insufficient [[WP:RS|quality sources]] to pin those assertions of notability. That would seem to imply that its [[User:Uncle G/On notability|notability]] is indeed very borderline. If, for example, we could source the &quot;Nasties&quot; awards, that would be a good start. If we do not even have that, it's a pretty poor sign, and I would then be inclined to merge to GU with a redirect. Do bear in mind that off-line sources are also acceptable, provided they satisfy [[WP:RS]]. At the time of writing, the NASTA site is down, so I can't check whether they have this information. [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] 10:14, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
:* I think the important issue here is to decide wether all student media is noteable. There are many articles on student radio stations and student rags on wikipedia. I can't understand why a student television station should be any different. The editor who first marked this for deletion, [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] is well known (especially to me) as a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism deletionist] with a particular interest in UK education, and again is following my gripe of international editors not understanding the relevant situations and taking the guidelines as defacto. Just because you can't find a weblink to it does not mean the subject is not notorious. I admit that it adds some credibility to the subject, but internet resources can not be relied on as accurate sources for facts. Something that has become more apparent to me since I have become a [[WP:NPP |New Page Patroller]] and a member of the [[WP:CVU | Counter Vanalism unit]].[[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 12:32, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
:* I think it might well be a problem of intuition and scale here. Anyone familiar with UK academia would consider that on the British scale Glasgow University is a very large well known institution, and as such many of it's major student bodies will be notable, almost inherently. However, on the international scale, Glasgow is a city of barely over a million people and as such even a local commercial broadcaster would seem non-notable, let alone a student TV station. The way I see it, there *are* sources, and hence GUST has been noted, and there *is* an assertion of notability and that also is sourced, so on technicality, even if the station does seem small, I think it passes. One of the major reasons it fails in some  international editor's eyes is that in the US it is not uncommon to have student/volunteer run stations broadcast over local cable and hence cover whole cities. This makes most UK student TV/radio stations seem relatively insignificant, despite their notability on a national scale. Oh, and the fact that Sherzo has  found websites that  are *not* sources hardly demonstrates anything - GUST isn't mentioned in the Domesday book or Vogue Magazine either.[[User:Tomisaac|Tomisaac]] 16:07, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

First Tomisaac i was merely clarify a point, as a tv station it fails notability mny schools in the US and canada have similar capabilities, if its notability rest on a cultural impact, since it predates some national broadcaster you'd expect some mention in a history of television in Scotland, so your argument is a strawman since niether of the publications cover television or its history in any great detail, (I know TV was invented in the UK in the 1930s not the 11th century so perhaps you should do a little more fact checking tomisaac, British inventors are good but not that good) I doubt anyone would dispute a university's notability but you do not inherit notability, i am not notable because i work for the government which is notable, Glasgow Uni itself list GUST as a club so is the university lying? it fails a google check, and since the internet is far more open forum than the national press if it was of the national &quot;notoriety&quot; as you claim i'd expect several hits, the claim to notability is also flimsy, on that the station itself will freely admit it has no evidence for its start date, and the article you state as establishing notability is a pep piece with many factual inaccuracies as you well know tomisaac (remember Bloomsbury TV?) since it has quite clearly wrong on at least some of its assertation even contradicting what station write about themselves, LUST is apparantly is focused on News, yet LUST claim they focus on filming at nightclubs, so is the article wrong or is the station lying? I would also remind you that that of the original AfD debate it was asserted that there were many newspaper articles, yet none have been sourced as notable UK papers are considered reliable sources so articles in the London Times or Manchester Guardian would be acceptable. another way to prove notable would to provide some notable alumni as Glasgow U paper does, this provides the relevant notability to satisfy the guidelines and if such could be provided i would be more than happy to support this article remaining. but how is GUST anymore notable than a group of scottish students who post videos on youtube?

TorstenGuise i think its a bit unfair what you said about Ohcon since its seems a pretty fair approach, and all reality must media clubs are where people essential get to play at being journalists, directors etc and a simple association with a college doesn't make them notable.[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 19:11, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

* I don't want to enter into a debate as to wether deletionism or inclusionism is better.[[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] and I have had debates over a number of UK Student related subjects. Mostly, revolving about this issue. Having said that, I do think that's a good thing, as it provokes debate. Something we have both engaged in over articles.&lt;br&gt;

:However, something I must take issue with is that notoriety can be less than the bench mark that you have placed. Not everything will be referenced to the London Times or the Manchester Guardian. You comment that noteable UK papers  are concidered reliable sources. What about local papers? Here's an example. The Guardian Media Group publish the local Manchester Evening News. Are subjects that have reference in a newspaper of this size, but left out of the Guardian not notorious enough for wikipedia? or is the M.E.N. not a credible source? If so, why not?&lt;/br&gt;

:* I did feel perhaps you misrepresented me, or may have glossed over what I wrote. I had contemplated a speaking up, but I know where you're coming from. I do agree that the issue is not deletionism vs inclusionism, but how we are building up a base of knowledge by writing about things which matter to people. It's too easy to dismiss the fact that an editor knows nothing about an article he/she may feel like contributing to, even if it may be deleting chunks out of it within the spirit or the letter of [[Wikipedia:Community_Portal#Departments|WP]], just because he/she lives several thousands of km away [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] 02:22, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
I local papers are less &quot;reliable&quot; because the quality of journalism is often lower, the ability to use them as fradulent references, and i some case the small community they serve, however a paper that is the secondary outlet of a national publisher or that serves a relatively large city are reliable [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:15, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

*I think your opinion of local rags in the UK are somewhat misplaced. Infact i have read better articles in some local newspapers than you would see in the national press. Also, as you are from where you are, please remember that the UK mainland is a lot smaller than some of those areas within such a federal body, a county in the UK is a big deal, and cities have to have a royal charter to be one; not just named one to add credence to a place. As such, everything is magnified and has more notoriety than would be in such a larger country :) [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 23:27, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

but thats why notability is important since it means multiple sources, making verifing easier, would you have no problem with an article solely sourced from the national enquirer or the daily express? [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 02:03, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
:*I don't think there is a hard and fast rule. Much depends not only on its coverage/readership, but on its general credibility, and sometimes on context or type of news reported. I think there is a rebuttable presumption that all established &quot;papers&quot; can be and are &quot;reliable&quot;, but there may be caveats. Let me illustrate with a few examples: [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] is an official source of news for China, like the [[BBC]] in some ways, and is generally reliable. However, as a mouthpiece of a government which does not tolerate dissent, and continues to operate state censorship, cannot be considered a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] when citing for &quot;sensitive matters&quot; such as political turmoil (''viz'' [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]), or the state of a leaders health (''viz'' [[Huang Ju]]). Many reputable papers have entertainment pages and gossip columns, where the quality of the reporting and fact-checking is often of a much lower standard. Some local papers serve communities so small or stable that they often have nothing to report, so almost anything out of the ordinary (such as an old lady tripping up and falling at the entrance of a local mall, or the local fire-brigade being called to rescue a scared cat from a tree) may well merit an article. [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] 02:22, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

*Sherzo, as far as reputable/notable sources go it's fair to say that [[The Independent]] and the [[NME]] are fantiastic references for the station, even though you might take issue with the journalism in those articles. Again, you're picking some rather unusual sources for us to look up. Why would Glasgow University Student Television be mentioned in the Manchester Guardian or the London Times? At any rate, apparently GUST was listed in the last [[The Guardian|Media Guardian]] directory[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/competition/page/0,14341,-437,00.html], a reference that probably wouldn't be relevant for inclusion in the article but I hope it'll tip the scales in this particular argument. Sherzo, Ohconfucius, please trust me when I say that the Media Guardian is a reputable UK media trade paper. Unfortunately it's an offline source and I don't own a copy of the directory, but bear with me and I'll see if I can get you the referencing details. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 08:45, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
:On another note, I think [[Wikipedia talk:Notability|this ongoing debate]] is a good reminder that the concept of notability is unpopular (or at least disputed) on Wikipedia.

:Jmalky left a note on my talk page asking for my opinion on the notability of this article.  Here goes.  Notability is merely shorthand for &quot;The likelyhood that reliable sources exist to which information in this article can be referenced.&quot;  That's it.  It hasn't anything to do with appeal, or likelyhood of someone careing about it, or importance, or anything like that.  Just do reliable sources exist, or are they likely to.  Reliable sources should be: extensive (more than just directory information), independant (not published by the subject or affiliates of the subject of the article) and multiple.  Under normal circumstances, student organizations, such as campus newspapers, intramural sports teams, local service organizations, or campus TV stations are NOT likely to have enough source material; however, ALL articles notability is ALWAYS to be tested on a case by case basis.  What should be asked of this TV station is: Do they broadcast outside of the university in question?  If it is an over-the-air TV station that is seen throughout the Glasgow area, then it is likely that its programming is reviewed in local media, and thus probably notable.  If this is something that only runs on the dormatory cable TV system; then it is likely that the ONLY people who see it are university students, thus the ONLY information about the station is likely to come from self-published sources, and THUS it would be not notable.  From looking at the article, I see two sources listed that seem independant, thus this article appears to MAYBE be notable.
:The bigger question to ask is; does this information better belong in the article of the University itself.  In general, student organizations should be included in the article about the relevent institution UNLESS the organization receives renough independant press to provide enough reliable sources to write an encyclopedic article from.  So basically, when Jmalky asked me on my talk page for my opinion as to if this organization is notable to write an article on?  Maybe.  I can't tell from what is there right now, but it has some potential.  What MAY be better as a whole is to combine ALL Glasgow University Media outlets (the TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Magazine) into ONE article, titled [[Glasgow University media organizations]] or something.  While each may not have enough sources to stand on its own, put them together and it makes for a better article.  Just my two cents... --[[User:Jayron32|Jayron32]]|[[User talk:Jayron32|&lt;small&gt;talk&lt;/small&gt;]]|[[Special:Contributions/Jayron32|&lt;small&gt;contribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 04:10, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks for the input. I just want to say though that I don't think merging the different Glasgow University media bodies would be appropriate. They're very seperate organisations, with widely varying degrees of notability. Glasgow University Guardian (newspaper) is definately notable in it's own right, I believe that's been agreed upon in the past. The radio station also easily meets the criteria for notability (city-wide broadcast, plenty of coverage in third party sources etc etc). The student magazine is all but defunct, although I believe it's still listed on various websites. Looking at the above, the vote for GUST seems to be a big fat ''maybe''.

==Second AfD Debate==
Following the unilateral actions of [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]], I have recreated the article and nominated it for deletion in order that the rules can be followed,, and a consesus reached. I will add that I'm for this article being kept, and have stated so on the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Glasgow University Student Television (second nomination)|AfD discussion page]]. Lets find out what other people think of it's current state of notability, not just from the people listed here. [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 22:10, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

Yes i took Unilateral action there had been no debate for some time you had simply stopped responding so i assumed you accepted the opposing argument, rather than hoping to avoid its deletion by delaying tactics. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 13:05, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

there is simply not a single argument in the AFD for it being kept, its not a vote after all, the [[british student television]] page more than adequately covers the culture, and GUST is simply not a TV station it has no broadcast capability[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 13:07, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

The consensus was to keep the page, and if you had created the AfD debate, then you might have had some warranty to your actions. Again I'm forced to point out that '''you''' are the only person with opposition to this article. You didn't even enter into the AfD debate, something which undermines your statements. As far as your statement on my [[User_talk:TorstenGuise#GUST|user page]], I will say that wikipedia is not a dictatorship either. [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 22:09, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

you mean a snap keep thats open for less than week [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] 23:32, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

an admin closed it, not me. [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] 23:48, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

==Citations==
The article has references from [[The Independent]] and the [[NME]]. Why aren't these valid sources? If anyone can do better I'll eat my hat. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 21:11, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

::No response? It's coming down. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] 11:48, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

==Citations again==
Careful when adding 'citation needed' tags. Have a look at the existing references. [[User:JMalky|JMalky]] ([[User talk:JMalky|talk]]) 09:13, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

-- I think that having 18 separate citation needed tags is ridiculous. To say that they show editors where improvement is required is ridiculous when the whole article is clearly in need of improvement. The template page for {{fact}} says that it is for particular statements or sections which require evidence and if the whole article requires it then to add an appropriate template to the head of the page. I think the carpet bomb of fact tags is redundant on this article. No? --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 19:10, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== NaSTA ==

Nasta is there because its the organisation that is the leading orgabisation in student TV and it plays an imporant part as such. There is only 1 source i can get my material from and that is the nasta website... im sorry if thats not a good enough source for you but that page has a right to be there and why when you type in nasta should you be redirected to something thats a completely different subject? This makes the nasta wiki page almost inaccessable which doesnt make sense seem as though there is so much information on there that is relivent and you wont find anywhere else in the future as nasta doesnt have a history section... So please dont remove the page again or i will have to report you for valdalism... because thats what it is the removing of suitable descriptive material [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 08:42, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Articles require reliable 3rd party sources, without such are they are not suitable for wikipedia I refer you this discussion http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:British_student_television/Archive_1#rewrite_and_possible_re_name
NaSTA lacks notability. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 14:04, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

== Keep NaSTA Where It Is ==

NaSTA is the pinicle of what students and trying to reach and therefore it is important that we know what has come before us and what is going to come after use. Is NaSTA is to become a better orgainiation that it needs its own page that works when you type nasta in rather than been directed to some crappy page that gives no indication to what NaSTA actually is... [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 08:46, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

do you have a source that its the pinnacle? do you have any sources at all that would warrant forking off? It is not wikipedia place help NaSTA be a better organisation it is not a resource, if you want that create a NaSTA wiki. The British student television is far better in a quality, because it is a prose rather than list form and relies on 3rd party sources.
This article also encompass the wider field of student tv not just that limited to an unsourced prep piece about one organization. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 14:12, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Yes bu british student televison is NaSTA... there is no other organisation other than that, so therefore what use is a british student televison page, it doesnt tell you anything about whats going on now. I am aware that wiki is not here to promote the organisation but the organisation exists and is the ONLY organisation that excists within british student televsion therefore is more relivent to whats going on now. Right wikipedia is about 3rd party sources otherwise your content gets taken down... i don't understand why you think that sourcing material is a bad thing... but anyway unsourced you have 6 sources i have much more than that. I can't source material from anywhere other than NaSTA itself because no one else bothers to cover it. One thing that also bothers me your content is about the history of student televison it has hardly no information about anything thats going on at the moment where as the NaSTA article is more up to date with what is happening now, which is as important as any history otherwise if i read the british student television page it looks like all student television has been swollowed up into a black hole. It is important that the NaSTA article is kept... So what is it you want? just the redirect back? or what? [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 08:23, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

if british student television is nasta you need reliable 3rd party sources to back that, whereas there is clearly evidence its not given the wealth of material outside of nasta, the admission of its own members in the archived talk i linked, and the fact Nasta apparently disappeared for some time hence its deletion from this article. you assertion that there is no other organization other than that would again require sourcing as the NUS and RSC both have awards for it, and the scholar channel provides a platform for much such content. the use of the british television page is that there is a consistent student television culture that can be reliably source(more than can be said of nasta) much of which exists outside of nasta so you claim shows POV bias can i also remind you really shouldn't create articles about yourself or groups your involved in. As for whats going on now, its not wikipedia's place to be any organizations news bulletin board that is what its own website etc should be for. Reliable 3rd party sources establish notability and are verifiable, please familiarize yourself with  [[Wikipedia:Notability|Notability]]. &quot;but anyway unsourced you have 6 sources i have much more than that.&quot; No you have one source cited repeatedly. &quot;I can't source material from anywhere other than NaSTA itself because no one else bothers to cover it.&quot; then it doesn't fulfill notability and doesnt belong on wikipedia.  &quot;One thing that also bothers me your content is about the history of student televison it has hardly no information about anything thats going on at the moment where as the NaSTA article is more up to date with what is happening now,&quot; that would be why its a history, as mentioned before this is an encyclopedia entry not a new service thus it's history is an important part, as for what's going on now if you can provide a reliable 3rd party source feel free to add it to the section. As for being swallowed into a black hole it makes clear that student television has grown extensively to point that any student with a laptop and camera can now create content. At present I see absolutely no justification for forking the nasta section off into its own article [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 01:29, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

You may not see the justification [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]], but this is a relatively new debate. You are quoting one that is two years old. Don't get me wrong here, but point of views change. You are acting as if you own the articles in question, which you don't ([[WP:OWN]]). You're reverting decisions without consensus. I understand your point of insufficient independent evidence, but you  can't justifiably use an old debate to justify your actions. [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] has a different point of view to yourself and needs to to more work in citing [[NaSTA]] in independent sources, but he can't do that methodically if you are just marking his edits as vandalism and reverting them. This is the same with the [[Glasgow University Student Television]] debate. There wasn't a consensus there, just inactivity. You said yourself that that was the reason you did the redirect. This was followed by the large debate against your decision and your [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/TortenGuise|RfC on me]] and all of the editors who opposed you. People have different point of views to you. Please respect them (Copy to all parties on their talk page, but please reply here) [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] ([[User talk:TorstenGuise|talk]]) 09:23, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

::First as far as the RFC that was because one of your [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Bluecord|group of editors created a sockpuppet]] named similarly named to me, impersonated me and started posting legal threats to admins. 
::Isn't the GUST deletion debate equally old? and just because its old doesn't make it invalid has it significantly changed since then? also I'll remind you wikipedia is not a democracy.
:: On the topic what justification is there for forking it off into a separate article from the section thats in this one article?[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 04:48, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

On the RFC, [[User:Bluecord|Bluecord's]] case was very different to my own, you didn't even cite him in the RFC. In fact, your accusation was:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;
most likely meatpuppets or though possible some sockpuppets in order to keep non notable articles like [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Glasgow_University_Student_Television_(second_nomination)]] ; none of those voting had editing the page or been involved in previous discussions. Sherzo 23:40, 22 August 2007 (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The community had challenged your decision, not just me. This was no reason to take your vengeance on us.
Secondly, you are acting as if you own the articles. Wikipedia is not a democracy, but there is some consensus that there is notability here and consensus can change per [[WP:CCC]]
Thirdly, it is not your right to decide the justification needed to resurrect the NaSTA article. Let the community decide.Student Radio is already represented through the [[UK_Student_Radio_Association]]. There is no reason why student television should not be. Before you quote [[WP:OSE]] that is not my justification. Allow some due process and the articles to be developed instead of repeatedly edit warring (which is really going on here).  For once, admit you are wrong and let us get back to the business of the day!.[[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] ([[User talk:TorstenGuise|talk]]) 12:49, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

Really you want to bring your groups actions that had at least 2 sockpuppeteer working in support of your agenda i thought you'd be too ashamed, How are bluecord and wongch? still pushing POV? as for vengeance lol, you actions and comments had generate a bad reputation so i wanted to check your group wasn't up to its old tricks again, but safe than sorry, if you had nothing to hide why does it scare you so? do you really feel this is the appropriate place for your petty complaints? or would you like to get back to the matter at hand?
I know your personal agenda is that every minute of every day of every person life ever deserves it's own article but beyond that you have not answered why this article needs to be forked, You obviously do need to refresh yourself on OSE otherwise you'd have not brought up another article as your justification. Why exactly can't the existing section in the current article be expanded that is after all due process? not simple create a new article because a member of that group wants to promote it? reverting vandalism or push articles isn't edit warring, and you know that, as for being wrong? perhaps you don't remember what being right since i can't remember the last time you were, and you were such a nice boy when i first met you [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 00:31, 13 March 2009 (UTC) 

For the last time, I am not in a group and I am not in a cabal! Those editors that were against your agenda were nothing to do with me - the RFC proved that! As far as the bluecord and wongch case, I condemn the use of sockpoppets and I even reverted vandalism on your talk page done by bluecord! Again, back to the matter at hand.
Nothing deserves an article by right on Wikipedia just because they exist. Having said that, it was you that combined them in the first place (and I think that a community decision needs to be made here as your 100% biased against it). If you read carefully my previous reply I was not using the student radio article as my justification:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before you quote [[WP:OSE]] that is not my justification.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''is'' edit warring. You have decided the current concensus of notability of NaSTA yourself. If you hadn't have done, then you wouldn't keep marking the changes as vandalism. When I was a new page patroller I'd mark something for deletion if I didn't think the notability had been made and let the community decide. I didn't go round as if I was judge and jury making decisions myself. As for vandalism, I'd mark vandalism and not a change in opinion. That is not our place either. You seem to think it's your place though!! [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] ([[User talk:TorstenGuise|talk]]) 09:48, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

My agenda? that i reverted POV pushs, vandalism and ego pieces? the only person wit agenda here is you, yu believe everything with the word student in deserves its own article. If it wasn't your justification why mention it? I'm not against anything (you seem to forget Jmalky and Tominsaac), i appreciate time has passed had things may have changed, but what i'm saying is if there is new 3rd party sources expand the Nasta section here with reliable sourced useful information, then if it gets to the point that its weight and sources warrant its own article then thats the point we discuss forking not before. [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 10:09, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

They are POV pushes, Vandalism and ego pieces ''in your opinion''. I have no agenda except to stop the filibustering and preventative edits that you are making in order to prevent development here. I don't believe that everything in the student world deserves its own article, I also haven't forgotten the earlier debates. However. Just marking new edits as vandalism are counter-productive. You've condemned the work before any discussion has taken place. That's my point. That's why you've got [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan's]] back up. You haven't given him the opportunity to discuss. Let's discuss it then. Start a new section. Lets talk about it! [[User:TorstenGuise|TorstenGuise]] ([[User talk:TorstenGuise|talk]]) 13:03, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

Is this really fruitful, or helpful to the topic at hand? I believe you have an inclusive agenda particularly when it comes to student groups you deny it, you claim i have some agenda against them, i deny it, how is it relevant or helpful to this question? if its a discussion you feel the need to continue perhaps our talkpages would be a better place? As for the earlier debates you mean like this [[Talk:British_student_television/Archive_1#rewrite_and_possible_re_name|one]]? or perhaps the entire archive would prove fruitful reading, as would [[Wikipedia:Notability|this]]. Self Promotion articles and the like are vandalism, and all we have been doing here is discussing it, so he has all the opportunity in the world to discuss it, and if wants to expand the nasta section and discuss those expansion here i am more than happy to discuss those too.[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 05:08, 14 March 2009 (UTC) 

O right so he's respecting my opinion by citing my material as vandalism is he? The information on british student televison is at least 5 years out of date there is no mention of anything that has happened resently... I found the eveidence for what has been happening for the last couple of years and this years nasta will be up once it has taken place. I'm not acting at all like i own the article, this reeks of double standards mate how can you accused me of acting like that and ignor that the other user has done exactly the same thing, as you see in my previous post (on the sherzo's personal wiki) i was willing to comprimise and just keep the nasta page but it have links from the british student page but obv if i put that change into affect it will be deleted by the afore mentioned member, now if that isnt acting like he owns the page i dont know what is. But yeh whatever nasta has a right to be there as it is the only organisation that ha anything to do with british student TV... whatever can't be bothered anymore whats the point in doing anything on this site if its just going to get reported for valdalism... [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 10:37, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

No article is here by right, its here because it fulfills notability, you claim its the only organization that has anything to do with British student tv but this is clearly an error since the scholar channel, NUS, RTS and certainly the University and their Unions are all organizations that have something to do with student television. It certainly doesn't warrant a  new article being forked from this one.[[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 04:48, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

After two AfD discussions ([[WP:Articles for deletion/Glasgow University Student Television|one]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Glasgow University Student Television (second nomination)|two]]) it is pretty clear that GUST is sufficiently notable for a stand-alone article, a merge here would not benefit either article or the encyclopædia in general. &lt;span style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #c30; padding: 3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Pablomismo| pablo]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;background-color: #ffc; color: #c30;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Pablomismo|hablo]].&lt;/sub&gt; 12:42, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

I was around glasgow uni media /src when that piece came out. The Independent basically phoned got the information from the vp comms at the src at the time. It will be near impossible to find a solid source for this sort of thing unless someone from GUST or the uni goes to the university archives and pulls some stuff out.--[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 00:52, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

So really its nothing more than a Uni myth and it could of been founded at anytime, whats the oldest record available for GUST? [[User:TC Murphy|TC Murphy]] ([[User talk:TC Murphy|talk]]) 12:48, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

I wouldn't say it's a myth just because the verification only exists in the archives of the uni or at least doesn't exist online. There are tapes from the 1960s in the gust archive that I have seen, they used to be on their website before it got &quot;upgraded&quot;. I'll have an ask about some people I know to see if we can dig something out. I'd heard at some point that it may have started as a TV society and then become a station so it would be good to get founding dates for both if that is the case. --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 17:57, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

By myth i meant that the start date is a fact essentially handed down from student to student, with most of the other facts being lost to the sands of time, I do find it odd that GUST doesn't have any mention in 3rd party sources both contemporary to its creation or in histories of TV if it as notable as claimed you'd think it would receive some recognition. Also how do you know it was the first in the UK just looking at [[Talk:British_student_television/Archive_2#Resources|this list]] and half the stations on it aren't in operation any more, how did they know that they were the first that some students at a polytechnic hadn't set up a station for a couple of years before them but when they left the station disappeared, at best you could claim its the oldest station still in operation but at present there is no 3rd party source to prove its older than YSTV. To be honest this whole article needs to be much better sourced. [[User:TC Murphy|TC Murphy]] ([[User talk:TC Murphy|talk]]) 19:28, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

==Nasta Edit war==
Does anyone know what this flurry of edits is about, it seems reading the &quot;source&quot; its a mixture of infighting and an attempt to hid this for fear of damaging nasta image, though Wiki doesn't censor if this problem isn't notable or 3rd party sourced then it shouldn't be on wiki anyways [[User:Sherzo|Sherzo]] ([[User talk:Sherzo|talk]]) 14:34, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

== Sources for this article ==

There are very few secondary sources for this student TV article, mainly because no one generally outside the students really bothers with student TV. So really other than sticking to material that can be referenced, there would be no article for student TV. 
Is there vaildity to having an article? Because when FACT is put in this article it gets deleted because of no secondary source, well all the article has hardly no sources on it, so is there a point in having an article? [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 15:32, 4 November 2009 (UTC)

:short answer is yes. Just because there are not very many secondary sources doesn't mean it doesn't belong in wikipedia. Infact I'd say that it is important for wp to have articles on subjects generally not covered elsewhere. --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 20:18, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

::I agree, but whenever i put stuff up it gets deleted, i know for a fact that Ore Oduba was NsSTA best male in 2008 now he presents newsround. But if i put that in the article it will be deleted, so what is the wikipedia stance on things that are known as fact by a number of people but there is no eveidence on the internet... My feeling is that the article needs expanding as student TV is expanding but any expansion is held back by people deleting none sourced content. [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 21:17, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

:::Is there really no sources for this stuff? [http://www.rts.org.uk/Events_det.asp?art_id=7880&amp;sec_id=3584 Royal Television Society] [http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/pages/sport/loughborough_swimmers_have_month_to_remember.html an article by him in a student paper about loughborough uni] [http://aarmstrong.org/journal/2008/03/17/nasta-conference-2008and-the-future a blog mentioning the nasta win]. I would imagine that even if there weren't these sources, then either the university of loughbourgh would publish an interview with him about starting out on LUSTV or you could get something similar published somewhere. For example I found a lot of similar citations for the [[Subcity Radio]] article.

I don't know the wiki policy on having uncited 'facts' in articles though tbh. --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 23:52, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

::: Just looked it up and unless you are saying something that is obviously true like london is the capital of england or that the sky is blue it has to be cited http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation.[1] The source cited must unambiguously support the information as it is presented in the article.[2] The source should be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question. Editors should cite sources fully, providing as much publication information as possible, including page numbers when citing books.

If no reliable, third-party sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.

Any material lacking a reliable source may be removed, but how quickly this should happen depends on the material in question and the overall state of the article. Editors might object if you remove material without giving them enough time to provide references, especially in an underdeveloped article. It has always been good practice to make reasonable efforts to find sources oneself that support such material, and cite them.

I had found 1 of the sources above but didnt know if the blog would be a good enough source to support the inclusion in the article, also link 2 doesnt work ha! But thanks anyway :) [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 18:54, 7 November 2009 (UTC)


I think it's the sort of thing that on its own as a source would be shakey but combined with the bbc source and other smaller sources would be strong. Dunno what's up with that 2nd one, was working last night...  --[[User:Cloudo|cloudo]] ([[User talk:Cloudo|talk]]) 19:20, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

== Comparison to student TV in the United States ==

This bit of the article makes no sense at all, MTVU is a channel directed at students, not made by students so i dont think ths bit of the article should be there as it has no validity [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 17:12, 4 November 2009 (UTC)

==Why this article?==
Where the hell did all the articles on NaSTA/the individual stations go? This article is completely meaningless. I mean seriously, I was in one of these stations not long ago and this is just... weird.

==Severe Problems==
This article has severe problems, It should be entirely rewritten using reliable sources, If this isn't possible then what material is salvageable should be merged to [[Television in the United Kingdom]] or the like. Nasta section in particular is self agrandising without any real sources.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.44.101.44|82.44.101.44]] ([[User talk:82.44.101.44|talk]]) 12:20, 26 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Its pretty hard to get sources as no one reports things like this on any comercial website, but that doesnt mean that there shouldn't be an article. What is in this article is fact! Therefore still has a right to be on wikipedia. The nasta setcion is like that because there are no sources that report on what student television is doing, the only sources we can use are the ones from the websites one the organisation itself. 
British student TV exists, nasta exists. but no one outside of that reports on it, and just because its not commerical doesn't mean there shouldn't be an article on it! [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 16:19, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

Nothing has a right to be on wikipedia, if it can't be verified it should be removed. We deal with facts here, if you want truth try philosophy.

And everything stated in this article is FACT! I feel you don't really understand my arguement, but the endity of student television exists, sure there are many more things that sources can't be found for... [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 23:57, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

And on the merger into British Television would be a bad idea! That article is already massively long and this information would be lost in there [[User:Xrateddan|Xrateddan]] ([[User talk:Xrateddan|talk]]) 00:06, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

==Name Change==
The article should be renamed Student Television in the United Kingdom, to fit the style of other such articles and avoid any problems regarding the inclusion of a Northern Irish university.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.44.101.44|82.44.101.44]] ([[User talk:82.44.101.44|talk]]) 21:35, 27 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
