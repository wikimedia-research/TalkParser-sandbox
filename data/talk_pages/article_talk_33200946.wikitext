[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of [[Special:Contributions/190.147.24.169|your recent edits]], such as the one you made to [[:Qatar]], did not appear to be constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]] or removed. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt; [[User:ForgottenHistory|ForgottenHistory]] ([[User talk:ForgottenHistory|talk]]) 01:45, 25 September 2011 (UTC)
:''If this is a [[closed proxy|shared IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''&lt;!-- Template:Shared IP advice --&gt;

[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Colombia]]. Your edits appear to constitute [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] and have been '''automatically''' [[Help:Reverting|reverted]].

Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG produces very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|610540}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
