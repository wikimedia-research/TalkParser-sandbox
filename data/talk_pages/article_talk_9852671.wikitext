== Citations and sources? ==

We've got one cited source, a book on coinage, and one external reference not actually linked to any particular statement in the article. To my mind, the article therefore deserves to be tagged as in need of improvement, especially of citations and sources. I have seen many other articles so tagged that were in much better shape than this one. Is there a consensus on this?
