== Rewriting needed ==

This is a lamentable piece of work. Articles that are submitted to WP are often rejected on the grounds that the references are inadequate, but this one has got in in spite of the fact that it doesn't have a single ref to back up its dubious claims. It's an important topic that deserves a proper treatment. [[User:RoachPeter|RoachPeter]] ([[User talk:RoachPeter|talk]]) 11:58, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::I have now written a draft article which I hope improves on the existing article - it is in my sandbox. I have some problems with it, and since they are general in nature I have put a note on the discussion page of Wikiproject Linguistics.
