==Comment==
Hey all.  I need someone local to tell me if SH 50 does in fact connect with Interstate 30, concurrent with SH 34, or if it ends north of Commerce where it meets SH 24.  The TxDOT designation says it reaches I-30, but it also says the certified mileage as of 2005 is 11.679 miles, which is the distance between Ladonia and Commerce.

Also, can somebody please remove the concurrency with SH 24 from the map?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Alexlatham96|Alexlatham96]] ([[User talk:Alexlatham96|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Alexlatham96|contribs]]) 02:29, 5 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
