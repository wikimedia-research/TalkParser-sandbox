== Blatant ripoff ==

I can't believe how much Shuanghuan has just ripped off other auto-manufacturer's design work.  I mean what, does the phrase &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; have no Cantonese/Mandarin equivalent or something?  The [[Shuanghuan Noble]] is a blatant ripoff of the Smart car.

:Many Chinese companies just copy and ripoff, not to mention that the products are bad quality as well. - [[User:M0rphzone|M0rphzone]] ([[User talk:M0rphzone|talk]]) 23:32, 29 May 2012 (UTC)
