==Questionable statements==

&quot;The song was long believed to be written about Brian's car.&quot;
:What? By whom was this believed? This song contains the lines &quot;Oh what she does to me/When she makes love to me&quot;. That is about his car!?
&quot;Also, John Lennon's famous 1980 hit &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; strongly borrows a melody from it.&quot;
:I suppose this could be true, but could someone point out to me where each song is similar?

:: How about the lines &quot;I guess I should've kept my mouth shut/When I started to brag about my car&quot;.  That is about his girl? [[Special:Contributions/69.203.157.67|69.203.157.67]] ([[User talk:69.203.157.67|talk]]) 13:59, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

It's not the verse that's similar...rather the pre-chorus. The line in Don't Worry Baby that says &quot;And she looks in my eyes, and makes me wanna cry when she says...&quot; is virtually the same melody as the line &quot;But when I see you darlin', it's like we both start fallin' in love again...&quot; in (Just Like) Starting Over.[[Special:Contributions/65.248.164.214|65.248.164.214]] ([[User talk:65.248.164.214|talk]]) 22:16, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== Brian singing Don't Worry Baby live... ==

...on the bonus track on the Concert/Live in London 2fer, recorded in Sacremento, CA on August 1, 1964, when Brian was still touring with the band. In fact, toured up until December of 64, so there was no reason for anyone else to be singing his songs until then.

Maybe I am misunderstanding this, but this is how I see it. After you (Zackfeld52) reverted back, I wasn't 100% certain, so I dug out my CD, and listened to it. It certainly seems to be Brian singing lead to me. Also, David Leaf's liner notes say it's him. Also, Andrew Doe says it's him: [http://www.btinternet.com/~bellagio/albumarchive1.html].

I am starting to think that the whole sentence should go as Brian sings the song live all the time now.

== Seemingly random statements ==

As it is, the article contains lines like: Lorrie Morgan sang lead vocals on the Beach Boys' &quot;Stars and Stripes Vol. 1&quot; album and was their only venture into the genre of country music to date.
I have no idea how this strange sentence relates to the subject of the article; maybe a part was deleted ? [[Special:Contributions/84.198.246.199|84.198.246.199]] ([[User talk:84.198.246.199|talk]]) 22:15, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

And also, what is the significance of the Tony Kornheiser quote ? As far as I can tell from his WP page, he's a sports reporter, and not known as a musician or music critic. I guess for every song you could find a celebrity who thinks it's the best song ever written.
