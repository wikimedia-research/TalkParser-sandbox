How can one best approximate tooth grubs or any other foods/beverages commonly served at Quark's bar or eaten by Ferengi?  (Dead serious about wanting to do this, by the way.  A friend of mine is making a pilgrimage to the Star Trek bar/restaurant in Vegas on his honeymoon, and the plan for the bachellor's party is closely patterned after Warf's on DS9 (excepting the fasting and length of the ritual).

:Well, I imagine the easiest thing to approximate would be Lokar beans.  There might already be a drink out there called &quot;Black hole&quot;.  And with a fresh eel and some imagination, you can probable make a good attempt at Eelwasser.  But as for tube grubs, what they eat on the show looks like actual grubs (I don't know if it is, that's just what it looks like).  Is that what your friend wants to eat?
