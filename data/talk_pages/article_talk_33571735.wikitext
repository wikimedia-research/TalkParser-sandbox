== Translation ==

I've tried my best at translating the article, but someone probably should proof red it. I left out a small section concerning specific classifications of German water ways.
I'd be also great if someone could align the image probably, because I can't get it centered. [[User:SkySilver|SkySilver]] ([[User talk:SkySilver|talk]]) 16:23, 1 May 2013 (UTC)
