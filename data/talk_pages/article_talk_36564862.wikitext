== Article improvement efforts ==

Efforts are being made to add content to this article to get it improved enough to nominate for [[WP:GAN|Good Article]].  Efforts to improve the article are nominally being based on the article about [[Lauren Jackson]] given the sheer amount of information available about female wheelchair basketball players when compared to other sports like [[goalball]].  Hence, the article could really use a good copy edit, maintaining as much information as possible for the short term until all the content is in to determine what belongs and does not. The goal is to nominate the article for [[WP:GAN|Good Article]] by the end of September. --[[User:LauraHale|LauraHale]] ([[User talk:LauraHale|talk]]) 10:49, 17 September 2012 (UTC)
