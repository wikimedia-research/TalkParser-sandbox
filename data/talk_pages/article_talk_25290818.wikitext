*Are the two references by The Carpenters, the same song, or not? [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 12:00, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
**Yes--same song. ''Offering'' was the original title of the album ''Ticket to Ride''. I wonder if either the Bee Gees or the Carpenters song could survive a notability review--so I suppose the dab page is fine where it is for now. Good detective work digging that out.
