Wikipedia is not the place to submit full recounts of every moment of a person's life/career/etc. Look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brendan_Joseland&amp;oldid=43395426 this]. This is way too much info. Compare the article to [[Shane Watson]], a Test player, and realise you were writing way to much. Try to make the Joseland article like the [[Nick Jewell]] entry; a short and concise bio.

:Re this, see the [[Talk:Brendan Joseland]] page. Just because Watson has a stub article doesn't mean Joseland neccessarily should. However, I think you should perhaps cut down the useless info such as the &quot;Did you know&quot; section of that article. It should have many of the details about his career but cut out the lesss notable bits.

==[[WP:AFL]]==
Wondering Scotty if you love your footy or cricket, if so, join [[WP:AFL|WikiProject AFL]] and [[WP:CRIC|WikiProject Cricket]]. Drop us a line on my talk page with any questions.

:No worries, I've cleaned up the article further so it's not as &quot;biased&quot;. One of the things on Wikipedia is that articles have to be balanced and unbiased (showing a Neutral Point of View, or [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]). That means staying away from words like sensational etc (see what I've done in the article and you should get the idea). It sounds complicated but it's not :) Feel free to ask me any questions mate. Also when you sign messages on discussion pages, write &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it will sign your name automatically. Cheers,  &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;[[WP:AFL|R]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Rogerthat|o]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;[[User:Rogerthat|gerthat]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Rogerthat|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' 02:09, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

==Unreferenced BLPs==
[[File:Information.svg|30px]] Hello Scott Thompson! Thank you for your contributions. I am a [[WP:BOT|bot]] alerting you that '''1''' of the articles that you created   is tagged as an[[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Sources| Unreferenced Biography of a Living Person]].  Please note that all biographies of living persons '''must be sourced'''. If you were to add [[WP:RELIABLE|reliable]], [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary]] [[WP:SOURCES|sources]] to this article, it would greatly help us with the current ''[[:Category:All_unreferenced_BLPs|{{PAGESINCATEGORY:All_unreferenced_BLPs}}]]'' article backlog. Once the article is adequately referenced, please remove the {{tl|unreferencedBLP}} tag. Here is the article:
