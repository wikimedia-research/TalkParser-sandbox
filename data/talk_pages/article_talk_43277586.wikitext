[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]]. I noticed that you made an edit concerning content related to a living (or recently deceased) person{{spaces|1}}on [[:Darren Collison]], but you didn’t support your changes with a [[WP:IC|citation to a reliable source]], so I removed it. Wikipedia has a strict policy concerning [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|how we write about living people]], so please help us keep such articles accurate. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Bagumba|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-biog1 --&gt; —[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 02:40, 22 December 2014 (UTC)
