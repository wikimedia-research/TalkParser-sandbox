;Welcome!
Hello and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikipedia]]. Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/ProjectsToday|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. The following links will help you begin editing on Wikipedia:
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Editing tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial|Picture tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
*[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
* '''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]]''' – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a '''[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]''' – this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|living person]]''' to any Wikipedia page to follow '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons]]' policy'''. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|referenced]] with multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].
* No '''[[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]]'''.
* If you are testing, please use the '''[[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]''' to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so]&lt;/span&gt;.
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]; doing so will result in your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on my talk page. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!

This is an automated message from [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]].  I have performed a web search with the contents of [[:Projectstoday]], and it appears to include material copied directly from http://projectstoday.com/AboutUs.aspx.  

It is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists. If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article. The article will be reviewed to determine if there are any copyright issues.

If substantial content is duplicated and it is not [[Wikipedia:Public domain|public domain]] or available under a compatible license, it will be deleted. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material. You may use such publications as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. See our [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright policy]] for further details. (If you own the copyright to the previously published content and wish to donate it, see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for the procedure.)&lt;!--This template located at Template:Csb-notice-pageincludes--&gt; [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]] ([[User talk:CorenSearchBot|talk]]) 10:39, 18 March 2011 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Projectstoday]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Projectstoday]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Projectstoday|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Projectstoday|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Cindamuse|Cind.]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Cindamuse#top|amuse]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:42, 18 March 2011 (UTC)

[[File:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''Welcome to Wikipedia.''' Everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia. However, the [[WP:ORGNAME|username]] you have chosen ''(ProjectsToday)'' seems to imply that you are editing on behalf of a group, company or website.

&lt;u&gt;There are two issues with this&lt;/u&gt;:
# '''It is possible that you have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]].''' In keeping with Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy, you must exercise great caution when editing on topics related to your organization.
# '''Your account [[WP:NOSHARE|cannot represent a group of people]].''' You may wish to [[Special:Userlogin/signup|create a new account]] with a username that represents only you. Alternatively, you may consider [[WP:CHU|changing your username]] to avoid giving the impression that your personal account is being used for [[WP:Spam|promotional purposes]].

Regardless of whether you change your name or create a new account, '''''you are not exempted''''' from the guidelines concerning editing where you have a conflict of interest. For information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].&lt;!-- Template:uw-coi-username --&gt; The article in question is [[Projectstoday]].

==Removing Speedy at [[Projectstoday]]==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from [[:Projectstoday]], a page you have created yourself.  If you do not believe the page should be deleted, you can place a {{[[Template:hangon|hangon]]}} tag on the page, under the existing speedy deletion tag (please do not remove the speedy deletion tag), and make your case on the page's [[Talk:Projectstoday|talk page]]. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy1 --&gt; - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 10:51, 18 March 2011 (UTC)
