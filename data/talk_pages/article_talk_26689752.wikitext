As you can see, most of the external links don't show very much at all (as is the case for so many German artists).  If you were to contact e.g. Berninger, Sagerer, Kroetz and Mueller, they would confirm the collaboration.  There is a youtube film by Sagerer/proT (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_2b54R8sBA) where the second person in the blue uniform, the man with the moustache, is Juergen von Huendeberg.
