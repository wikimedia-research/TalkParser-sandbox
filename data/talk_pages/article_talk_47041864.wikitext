== Neutrality ==

Hi! Just so you know, I slightly altered the controversy section that you added to [[Time to Die (Electric Wizard album)]]. In particular, I removed a phrase that seemed to fail to meet Wikipedia's policies on [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]]. Thank you for your contributions to that section! ~ &lt;b&gt;[[User:BU Rob13|Rob]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
