==Gun Control==
Workmen's Circle is anti-gun.  They are proud of this!  Why aren't you?  I'm restoring the edit.

:They support gun control - that's what the source says, and that is the neutral way of stating it.  &quot;Oppose gun rights&quot; is turning it around into a POV statement.  And the footnote citation is better form, and one already established in the article. &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Tvoz|Tvoz]]&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Tvoz|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 08:44, 30 September 2008 (UTC)
