I am just learning to contribute to Wiki by creating and editing a new contribution regarding the great Croatian musician Nenad Bach.  When I have the correct information and references I hope to add it to the regular Wiki under the name &quot;Nenad Bach&quot; (not on my User Page, like it is now).   Contributions are welcome if properly referenced.  [[User:Famous Diver|Famous Diver]] ([[User talk:Famous Diver#top|talk]]) 16:01, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

Is this entire page just total blatant self-promotion?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.182.161.200|81.182.161.200]] ([[User talk:81.182.161.200|talk]]) 01:29, 7 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
