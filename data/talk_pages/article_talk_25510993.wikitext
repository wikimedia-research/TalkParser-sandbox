[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Nuclear warfare]], did not appear to be constructive and has been reverted. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt; -'''[[User:MBK004|MBK]]'''&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:MBK004|004]]&lt;/sub&gt; 07:56, 21 December 2009 (UTC)

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop adding inappropriate external links to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Nuclear warfare]]. It is considered [[Wikipedia:Spam|spamming]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#ADVERTISING|Wikipedia is not]] a vehicle for advertising or promotion. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, additions of links to Wikipedia will not alter search engine rankings. If you continue spamming, you will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia.

:Details classified by the DOD means that they stay out, because we have policies about [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliable sourcing]], which you have blatantly violated with your edits. '''You will not be given another warning.''' -'''[[User:MBK004|MBK]]'''&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:MBK004|004]]&lt;/sub&gt; 08:02, 21 December 2009 (UTC)
