I'm pretty sure that the image on the article is of a SMALL tortoiseshell: see http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/Butterfly/17/Butterfly.html?ButterflyId=39&amp;Country=sc&amp;Size=&amp;Colour=&amp;Features=&amp;Family= c.f. http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/Butterfly/17/Butterfly.html?ButterflyId=63&amp;Country=sc&amp;Size=&amp;Colour=&amp;Features=&amp;Family=. However, in the absence of an image to fix it with (not that I know how to) it'll have to stay until someone more expert than I comes along.

:Image was changed. I assume new one is correct? [[User:Dger|Dger]] ([[User talk:Dger|talk]]) 17:17, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
