==Heard the latest?==
[[Image:Texas Longhorn.jpg|thumb|left|Heil the Hero]] Sonia visited Laloo for political discussions. Laloo took her around his barn, his pride and joy. One of the cows chose this occasion to volubly emit a volumionus burst of methane. Sonia nearly fainted from the odour, so Laloo said: &quot;Sorry. But it happens&quot;. Sonia replied: &quot;Don't mention it. For a minute I thought it was one of the cows&quot;. [[User:Red rising plate|Red rising plate]] 16:42, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
