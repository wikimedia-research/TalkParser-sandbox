I would like to request an unblock of my IP address. It says that I was abusing my privileges and I don't see how. I had created an article for a company, FotoFlexer, which has now been erased twice. I nearly copied the entire entry from a company called [[Picnik]] but I edited the parts that were different. Can you explain the difference between the two articles and why mine was deleted and Picnik's wasnt?

Thanks,


Zach
