==Move==
I propose a move to &quot;Kir Bulychyov&quot;, as that is the more correct way to spell his name in English per [[WP:RUS]].  Was there a reason that the article was created under its current name? [[User:Esn|Esn]] 22:12, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:Kir Bulychev is the name used in English.

== satires at life in Soviet Russia ==

Is there any soure that this book satirizes Soviet Russia? It seeme that in English Wikipedia any satirical book written in the USSR labelled as &quot;satire or Soviet life&quot; etc while no western book labelled as &quot;satire on life in the USA&quot; etc.--[[User:Dojarca|Dojarca]] 21:40, 7 May 2007 (UTC)
