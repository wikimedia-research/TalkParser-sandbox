== Proposed move ==

This article is proposed to be moved to [[List of recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (Australia)]] so that viewers do not associate this page with other [[Distinguished Service Cross]]'s issued by other countries. Any comments or objections sought. Regards [[User:Newm30|Newm30]] ([[User talk:Newm30|talk]]) 02:04, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
