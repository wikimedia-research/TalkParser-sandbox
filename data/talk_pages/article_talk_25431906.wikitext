'''Welcome!'''&lt;br&gt;Hello and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikipedia]]. Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. The following links will help you begin editing on Wikipedia:

'''Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:'''
* '''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]]''' - do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a '''[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]''' - this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons| living person]]''' to any Wikipedia page. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|referenced]] to multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].
* No '''[[Wikipedia:edit warring|edit warring]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry|sockpuppetry]]'''.
* If you are testing, please use the '''[[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]''' to [{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so].
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]], doing so will result your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].
* Lastly, if you are editing an article about an individual or group of people, please adhere to '''[[WP:BLP|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons]]' policy'''.


The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia Tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on {{#if:A8UDI|[[User talk:A8UDI{{!}}my talk page]]|my talk page}}. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Hami456]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Hami456]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guideline for biographies]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Hami456|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Hami456|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-bio-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[w:User:Ks0stm|&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Ks0stm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #ffa500;background:#ffce7b;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you reply here, please leave me a {{[[Template:Talkback|Talkback]]}} message on [[User talk:Ks0stm|my talk page]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 16:30, 15 December 2009 (UTC)
