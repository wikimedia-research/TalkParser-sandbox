== 5 or 6 km? ==

The intro says that they are 6 km from the entrance, the text says 5. Please correct one, if possible. --[[User:Nomeata|Nomeata]] ([[User talk:Nomeata|talk]]) 13:25, 3 March 2011 (UTC)

==Vihara - a prayer hall ==
Read the description it says chaitya is a prayer hall and vihara is meant for study &amp; living. Then there is a Pic that says Vihara - A prayer hall. Quite confusing ?? --[[User:dhoomady]]  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 05:28, 8 June 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
