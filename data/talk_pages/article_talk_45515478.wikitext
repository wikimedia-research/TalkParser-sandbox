[[:Polytechnic University of Timișoara]] → {{no redirect|Politehnica University of Timisoara}} – The University has recently changed formally its Official Name, and we would like to use the official translation for the Wikipedia page in english.

*'''Oppose for now''' per [[WP:OFFICIALNAME]] and [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. Yes, the university may have changed its official name, but what matters here is the commonly used name in English. I have not seen evidence that this has changed yet. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Amakuru|Amakuru]] ([[User talk:Amakuru|talk]]) 10:58, 23 January 2015 (UTC)

We will complete the formatting of the article with the new name and solve some of the issues, and also can provide official signed papers that confirm the name change, also in English. Would that suffice for the name change on Wikipedia to be completed?

*'''Comment''' - leaning toward &quot;Politehnica University of Timișoara&quot;, due to a) consistency with [[Politehnica University of Bucharest]] and b) a seeming preference for this variant by Google/Google Books. However, either is ultimately fine, provided we settle on one, both for the article and the associated categories. - [[User:Biruitorul|Biruitorul]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Biruitorul|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 04:37, 3 March 2015 (UTC)

**'''Support''', [[Politehnica University of Timișoara]]. The consistency with the name of Politehnica University of Bucharest although it is true, is not an argument. Each university has its own official name, there is no uniform rule names. The [http://huro.upt.ro/Move_UPT_eng.jpg Official signed paper] is based on the Romanian Government's Decision no. 493 published in the Monitorul Oficial no. 447/2013-07-22. The word ''Politehnica'' in the name of the university (as well as the one in Bucharest) is a proper noun, not an adjective. Is not ''Universitatea Politehnic'''ă''' (adjective) Timișoara'' = Polytechnic University of Timișoara, but ''Universitatea Politehnic'''a''' (noun) of Timișoara''. --[[User:Turbojet|Turbojet]] ([[User talk:Turbojet|talk]]) 08:52, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' – Two issues here: (1) Whether to put that squiggly line under the ș or not. No opinion on whether &quot;official&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, or &quot;English&quot; names guidelines are relevant to the use of diacritics. [[Timișoara]] has the squiggly; we should probably keep consistent with that. {{no redirect|Timisoara}} redirects there however. (2) No opinion on whether &quot;official&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, or &quot;English&quot; names guidelines are relevant to &quot;Politehnica&quot;. I assume this is the [[Romanian language]] word for &quot;Polytechnic&quot;. If there's a problem with using that word on Wikipedia, then there are [[Politehnica|a couple other articles]] with the problem too. I assume that the University has not changed their Romanian language name, but only the &quot;official name&quot; that they wish to be called in English. Regarding the silly idea that we need to wait for third-party reliable sources to confirm the name change. See [[List of university and college name changes in the United States]]. Show me one case where we intentionally waited for months to see whether sources respected the university's name change, or where reliable sources insisted on continuing to call the school by its old name months or years after the name change.

* '''See also''' [[List of institutions using the term &quot;institute of technology&quot; or &quot;polytechnic&quot;]]. If we call Polish universities [[Politechnika]] and Italian universities [[Politecnico]], it seems fair to call Romanian universities &quot;Politehnica&quot;.

**I don't really see the use of [[S-comma]] as something we should be debating. Wikipedia uses diacritics for foreign place names, unless there's an especially good reason not to.

*Some consideration on official name and common name of the subject.
:The first name (1920) was ''Școala Politehnică din Timișoara = Polytechnic'' (adjective) ''School of Timișoara'', according to the French model ''[[École Polytechnique]]''.

:In 1948 the communist regime held that only the humanist schools are &quot;universities&quot; (??), the technical ones are &quot;institute&quot;. Therefore the name was ''Institutul Politehnic Timișoara = Polytechnic'' (adj.) ''Institute of Timișoara''. All this time the common name was ''Politehnica din Timișoara = The Polytechnic'' (noun) ''of Timișoara''.

:After 1990, in Germany was told that &quot;institute&quot; means &quot;college&quot;, not &quot;university&quot;. To avoid misunderstandings, the name was changed to ''Universitatea Tehnică din Timișoara = Technical University of Timișoara'', according to the German model ''Technische Universität''. This has confused the public, that would be ''another'' university, not the polytechnic one. It took a name that contains both the words &quot;university&quot; and &quot;polytechnic&quot; (noun). The solution was found in 1995 with the name ''Universitatea „Politehnica” din Timișoara = &quot;Politehnica&quot; University of Timișoara''. The quotation marks indicate that &quot;Politehnica&quot; is a proper noun (name), not common noun.

:But the quotes were annoying (the Romanian quotes are smart quotes, not straight quotes), so that in 2013 have been removed. The word ''Politehnica'' remained a proper noun and should not be translate.

:The actual name of the article, ''Polytechnic'' (adj.) ''University of Timișoara = Universitatea Politehnic'''ă''''' (adj.) ''din Timișoara'' never was the name of the school, neither official nor common, and is the worst option. --[[User:Turbojet|Turbojet]] ([[User talk:Turbojet|talk]]) 19:41, 18 March 2015 (UTC)
