[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Darkwind|Darkwind]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:Bradley Gray]], but you didn't provide a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. It's been removed for now, but if you'd like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see [[WP:REFBEGIN|the referencing for beginners]] tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Darkwind|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; &amp;mdash;[[User:Darkwind|Darkwind]] ([[User talk:Darkwind|talk]]) 13:03, 20 September 2013 (UTC)
