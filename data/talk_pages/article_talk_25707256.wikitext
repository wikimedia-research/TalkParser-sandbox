== Map's caption wrong ==

&quot;The cities of Philadelphia, Allentown, Pittsburgh, Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and Erie went Democratic, while the entire rest of the state voted Bush, by varying margins&quot; is just false.  I'm from [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], and the map clearly shows that county, among others, went Democratic.  MontCo ''borders'' Philadelphia, but it is clearly a suburban area.  Thus, I've removed the caption. [[User:Superm401|Superm401]] - [[User_talk:Superm401|Talk]] 03:26, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
