[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia! I am glad to see you are interested in discussing a topic. However, as a [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|general rule]], talk pages  are for discussion related to improving the article, [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#FORUM|not general discussion]] about the topic. If you have specific questions about certain topics, consider visiting [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|our reference desk]] and asking them there instead of on article talk pages. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-chat1 --&gt; ''Discussion on talk pages should be related to improving the article. In addition, do not share your personal experiences as it is [[WP:ORIGINAL|original research]].'' [[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] [[User talk:Jasper Deng|(talk)]] 22:57, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
