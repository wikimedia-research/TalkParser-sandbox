== Suggestions for improvement ==

&quot;The school became a bilingual school.&quot; What two languages?

The school's website stated that &quot;it is believed that girls’ hostel is the [“Opatha walawwa” (Mahagedara walawwa)] at percent.&quot;
Yes, the source does say that, but it's incomprehensible.  Why quote it?  [[User:Maproom|Maproom]] ([[User talk:Maproom|talk]]) 17:57, 6 December 2013 (UTC)
* 1. The source does not say what two languages 
* 2. I think &quot;at percent&quot; is supposed to be &quot;at present&quot; so I'll comment that in too
