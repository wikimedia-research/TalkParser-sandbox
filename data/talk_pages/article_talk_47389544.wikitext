;Welcome!
Hello and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikipedia]]. Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/TOMJONES77|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. The following links will help you begin editing on Wikipedia:
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Editing tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial|Picture tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
*[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
* [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]] – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] – this is one of Wikipedia's core policies.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|living person]] to any Wikipedia page and follow [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons policy]]. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|referenced]] with multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].
* No [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]] or [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]].
* If you are testing, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]] to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so]&lt;/span&gt;.
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]; doing so will result in your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].
* Do not use talk pages as discussion or forum pages as Wikipedia is [[WP:NOT#FORUM|not a forum]].

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on my talk page. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!{{z129}}

This is an automated message from [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]].  I have performed a web search with the contents of [[:Seven Factor]], and it appears to include material copied directly from http://www.sinisterguitarpicks.com/seven-factor/.  

It is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists. If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article. The article will be reviewed to determine if there are any copyright issues.

If substantial content is duplicated and it is not [[Wikipedia:Public domain|public domain]] or available under a compatible license, it will be deleted. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material. You may use such publications as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. See our [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright policy]] for further details. (If you own the copyright to the previously published content and wish to donate it, see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for the procedure.)&lt;!--This template located at Template:Csb-notice-pageincludes--&gt; [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]] ([[User talk:CorenSearchBot|talk]]) 06:18, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Seven Factor]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Seven Factor]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article or image appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. This article or image appears to be a direct copy from http://www.sinisterguitarpicks.com/seven-factor/. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''.

If the external website or image belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text or image — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website or image but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Seven Factor|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions]]) 09:52, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
