==Please help with Requested Move==
I have requested a move of this article to Greater Nectar Bat to maintain consistency with the naming used on the many other articles on [[megabat]]s - which are listed under their common English names. However, I am not at all sure I have done it properly. If anyone can help I would be most grateful. Many thanks, [[User:John Hill|John Hill]] ([[User talk:John Hill|talk]]) 03:39, 22 May 2011 (UTC)
