== Coordinates ==

I've added coordinates for this site. If someone more familiar with the grounds could confirm them it would be appreciated. [[user:RichMac|RichMac]] [[User_talk:RichMac|(Talk)]] 17:12, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

== Naming Rights ==

Might be a new name for the Coliseum someday...(Province article is dated April 30th). The article also cites this: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Pacific Coliseum has been around since 1968 and is an obvious candidate for renaming, although McDaniel doesn't know how the public will react since &quot;everyone knows it as that.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'll add the supposed actual opening date (with refference)
