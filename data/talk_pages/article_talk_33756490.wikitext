[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Delphi method]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG produces very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|727431}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again. 
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Delphi method]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Delphi+method&amp;diff=460777868&amp;oldid=451524733 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/115.115.68.100|115.115.68.100]] [[User:115.115.68.100|(u)]] [[User talk:115.115.68.100|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.893012 on 2011-11-15T14:07:25+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 727431 --&gt;.

== Your submission at [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]] ==
[[File:Citaton-needed-vertical.svg|150px|right|link=Wikipedia:Citing sources]]

I noticed your submission in [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]], '''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/probing question]]'''.  Thanks! It will be reviewed by a volunteer soon.

Before it can be added to Wikipedia, your submission should have references.  All articles on Wikipedia should have inline, numbered references after facts, showing the 'reliable source' (a newspaper, book, etc.) where the information can be checked, so that all information is [[WP:V|verifiable]].
[[File:Citing_sources_tutorial,_part_1.ogv|right|thumb|Here's a video tutorial - hit play, then right-click for &quot;full screen&quot;.]]

Here's an example of how to add references:
&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot; style=&quot;background:#def; border:1px solid #468; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em auto; background-color:#EBFFEB;&quot;&gt;Chzz is 98 years old.&amp;lt;ref&gt; &quot;The book of Chzz&quot;, Aardvark Books, 2009. &amp;lt;/ref&gt;

He likes tea.&amp;lt;ref&gt; Smith, John. &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://foonews.com/Article42 Interview with Chzz]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Foo News, 1 April 2010. Retrieved 2011-05-22.  &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;== References ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That makes the references automatically display as small numbers&lt;sup&gt;[{{colour|blue|1}}]&lt;/sup&gt; which will link to the details in the section titled == References == at the end.  You can [[User:ChzzBot IV/Example page with references|see that example in action here]].

Please add references to your submission, which will be reviewed as soon as possible. See also, [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]]. If you need any help, just put {{tn|helpme}} at the end of ''this'' page, followed by a question or get into our live help chat chanel at {{IRC|wikipedia-en-help}}.
