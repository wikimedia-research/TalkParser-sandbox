== Kappa Kappa Gamma ==

Thank you for your comments. The &quot;Other Facts&quot; additions were added as a special section because another contributor didn't want certain individuals to be included in the &quot;Notable Kappas&quot; section. Some of the Notable Kappas removed (by others) included an author (Lori Gottlieb), an actress (Candice Bergen) and a world-renowned AIDS researcher (Dr. Nancy Haigwood). The addition of the hazing information and the &quot;Carla Sander&quot; information was made only after repeated deletion vandalism of factual material from the article. Thank you again for your comments. - jf &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jimmyflathead|Jimmyflathead]] ([[User talk:Jimmyflathead|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jimmyflathead|contribs]]) 17:36, June 16, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Kappas that are not anymore ==

Candace Bergman WAS a Kappa-she quit. So whe should not be included anymore. Boy you all seem to hate it when a non member claims membership, but YOU can do it when it is convenient and make you look elite? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jackjackattack|Jackjackattack]] ([[User talk:Jackjackattack|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jackjackattack|contribs]]) 17:21, July 18, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
