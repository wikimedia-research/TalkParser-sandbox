The article is satisfactory as is. It could afford to have more in-depth info, but the problem is that there is very little ''verifiable'' information about Heather Hutchison. While I do have regular contact with her, I do not want to violate the Wikipedia's policies on [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] by using her as a primary (and therefore non-citeable) source.
