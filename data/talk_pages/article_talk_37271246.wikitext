Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:Couch]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=516808404&amp;oldid=513305168 here] to [[Couch]] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]].  The external link(s) you added or changed (http://cheapcouch.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/hello-world/|couch&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bwordpress\.com) --&gt;) is/are on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam0 --&gt; --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 12:28, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not add inappropriate [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] to Wikipedia. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]], nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites with which you are affiliated, and links that attract visitors to a web site or promote a product.  See [[Wikipedia:External links|the external links guideline]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam guideline]] for further explanations. Because Wikipedia uses the [[nofollow]] attribute value, its external links are disregarded by most search engines. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it.
