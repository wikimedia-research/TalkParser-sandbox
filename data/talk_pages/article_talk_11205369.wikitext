== Request for improved diagrams ==

The diagrams of substitution tilings should highlight the presence of the initial prototile in the interior of the expanded tiling.  Without this, the substitution tiling might not tile the entire plane.   For instance, if the second substitution tiling mapped the prototile to its placement in the lower left of the expanded tiling, then the system would only tile the first quadrant of the plane.&amp;ndash;[[User:Dan Hoey|Dan Hoey]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Dan Hoey|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:39, 16 June 2007 (UTC)

== Notation, terms and correct definition / Discussion Dan Hoey - Dirk Frettl&amp;ouml;h ==


  I want to remove the tag 'This article does not cite any references or
  sources.', and add references. The once I find most appropriate are

  (Do you have another suggestion?) 

No, unless Gruenbaum and Shepard have something.  I really haven't read that
much.  I generally tried to straighten out the article so it was explicit
enough to express the covering condition (below), though perhaps I went too
close to OR in doing so.

  If I use the two sources above, I have to rechange the definition of a
  substitution tiling. It seems to be agreed now that this (my old one) is
  the appropriate one:
 
  'Given a tile-substitution sigma, a tiling T consisting of copies of the
  prototiles T_1,T_2,...,T_m is called substitution tiling (for the tile
  substitution sigma), if each finite pattern in T is a copy of some pattern
  in sigma^k(T_i) (for some k,i).'

I agree that &quot;copies&quot; may be a better term than &quot;placements&quot;.  I think I got
the &quot;expanding map&quot; from the copy I started with, and I agree that calling
it a &quot;tile substitution&quot; may be a better term.  I'm not sure the condition
that Q be linear with positive eigenvalues is right--perhaps it must be a
similarity map.  Still, I think the language needs to be defined, so that
when we speak of a &quot;copy of a prototile&quot; we can expect to extract the
isometry that takes the prototile to its copy.

  Why? 1. The theory of nonperiodic tilings is now enriched by methods of
  topology and dynamical systems. The definition above is compatible with
  the definition of a tiling space, or a tiling dynamical system,
  whenever the substitution is primitive.

This is very good.  I take it that we now wish to consider substitution
tilings that may not cover R^d (or not even live in a Euclidean space at
all).

Something should be done to cover conditions that ensure that the tiling
covers R^d, though.  For instance, the limit tilings of the example diagrams
might not cover R^2--they might cover a half-plane, a quadrant, or an
octant.  It is the condition that a finite pattern is a copy of a pattern in
the '''interior''' of sigma^k(T_i) that I wanted to be able to express.  It
was certainly a mistake to restrict substitution tilings with that
condition, but the condition is still important to present.  I don't know
how it is usually treated in substitution theory, but I expect you do, and I
encourage you to present it.

  2. Your definition may define some tiling T as a substitution tiling, but
  a translate T+x may not be one. For instance, the canonical square tiling
  T of the plane is, but T shifted by (sqrt(2),0) is not.

I do not believe that is true.  If phi_0 were a translation by (sqrt(2),0),
I think that would work.  But it is more likely that I am missing your
point.

  Another point is, that now the definition is even longer and more
  technical than mine. I would prefer, in agreement with the references
  above, a simpler formulation.

I agree that I overcomplicated things. [[User:Frettloe|Frettloe]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Frettloe|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:39, 8 Aug 2007 (GMT), [[User:Dan Hoey|Dan Hoey]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Dan Hoey|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:49, 9 Aug 2007 )

== Definition of substitution tiling ==

I am completely happy with 'placements' and will use it from now on in my
papers instead of 'copies'. Seems indeed clearer.

  I'm not sure the condition that
  Q be linear with positive eigenvalues is right--perhaps it must be a
  similarity map.

First: ... all eigenvalues larger than one. 
Second: No, that's the point. Here is a tile substitution using an expanding map Q
which stretches by a factor of approx 1.5 in the vertical direction, and
by a factor of approx 1.9 in the horizontal direction:
http://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/baake/frettloe/sl-mar.pdf , page 13
This is not a similarity map, but it should be called a tile substitution.
(in the literature, this is usually called self-affine substitution...
in contrast to self-similar substitution...). 

  Something should be done to cover conditions that ensure that the tiling
  covers R^d, though.  For instance, the limit tilings of the example diagrams
  might not cover R^2--they might cover a half-plane, a quadrant, or an octant.
  It is the condition that a finite pattern is a copy of a pattern in the
  '''interior''' of sigma^k(T_i) that I wanted to be able to express.  It was
  certainly a mistake to restrict substitution tilings with that condition, but
  the condition is still important to present.  I don't know how it is usually
  treated in substitution theory, but I expect you do, and I encourage you to
  present it.

I guess I can clarify this point. What you have in mind is what used to be
somehow the definition of a substitution tiling, or better, of a
self-similar tiling. The current definition:

  Every tiling of {\mathbb R}^d, where any finite part of it is congruent
  to a subset of some \sigma(Ti) is called a substitution tiling (for the
  tile substitution (Q,\sigma)).

rules out slight difficulties, and is just shorter (maybe more elegant).
First, it says 'A tiling of R^d', so one has not to bother whether the
whole space is filled, or only part of it.
