:His from a History:
     This Synodal Period, which lasted until 1917, was a period of spiritual low for the Church,
     although there were a few bright spots. Missionary activity, always a strong feature of the Russian Church,
     expanded throughout Siberia and Central Asia, eventually reaching Alaska. Certain monasteries were revitalized,
     including the famous center of Valaam, and the spiritual traditions of Mt. Athos,
     especially popularized by Paisius Velichkovsky and his Philokalia, reached Russia,
     through the efforts of Metropolitan Gabriel of Moscow and his disciple, Nazarius, Abbot of Valaam.
     A special system of spiritual direction, eldership (or starchestvo) developed,
     especially popularized at the Optino Hermitage under the Elders Leonid, Macarius, Amvrosy and Joseph,
     and a few Saints shone during this time, especially St. Tikhon of Zadonsk ( 1783 commemorated August 13),
     a revitalizer of pastoral life, and St. Seraphim of Sarov ( 1833 commemorated January 2 and July 19).
