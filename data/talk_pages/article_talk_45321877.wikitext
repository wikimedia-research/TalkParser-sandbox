The article [[Agatone]] has been [[WP:BLPPROD|proposed for deletion]] because it appears to have no references. Under [[Wikipedia:BLPPROD#Objecting|Wikipedia policy]], this newly created '''[[WP:BLP|biography of a living person]]''' will be deleted unless it has at least one reference to a [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]] that directly supports material in the article. 

If you created the article, please don't be offended. Instead, consider improving the article. For help on inserting references, see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners|Referencing for beginners]], or ask at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]]. Once you have provided at least one [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]], you may remove the {{tl|prod blp}} tag. '''Please do not remove the tag unless the article is sourced.''' If you cannot provide such a source within seven days, the article may be deleted, but you can {{#ifexist:Agatone|request that it be undeleted|[[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request that it be undeleted]]}} when you are ready to add one.&lt;!-- Template:ProdwarningBLP --&gt; [[User:Qwertyus|Q&lt;small&gt;VVERTYVS&lt;/small&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:04, 6 February 2015 (UTC)
