Victor12 I would like to submit the following article in the OTHER section. It's a travel piece but with a much broader scope and mandate. It takes issue with the guide books that counsel against renting a car in Peru. My position is that if millions of Peruvians successfully negotiate their passage from point A to point B everyday, why can't the tourist be among those millions. My article dispells the myths and fears re driving in Peru. The article also has much to offer re tourism. Here's the link: http://www.artsandopinion.com/2006_v5_n2/lewis-21.htm Thanking you in advance for the consideration.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Artsandopinion|Artsandopinion]] ([[User talk:Artsandopinion|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Artsandopinion|contribs]]) 02:39, 13 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Trial of Fujimori ==

This page currently reads: 

''Under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000), the country started to recover; however, accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial 2000 elections. Since the end of the Fujimori regime, Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth; the current president is Alan García.''

I wonder if the page should briefly mention that Fujimori is [[Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial|currently on trial]]. On one hand, I want to avoid &quot;presentism,&quot; but on the other hand this is pretty noteable. I can't think of any other countries in the world that are currently trying one of their democratically-elected presidents for murder. Peru is in a really unusual (perhaps even unique) position with that trial. --[[User:Descendall|Descendall]] ([[User talk:Descendall|talk]]) 23:37, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

== Economy section Peru article ==

I added certain figures regarding the Peruvian economy under the economy section however they were deleted due to trying to avoid [[WP:RECENTISM]]. In accordance to this I re-added the data and added short descriptions of economic time periods throughtout Peruvian history in accordance to [[WP:RECENTISM]]. This was again deleted for adding information that was not relevant enough to be put in the article and therefore making the article to long. My original reason for adding the economic figures was because I felt that if some figures were present such as [[HDI]], poverty rate, [[gdp]], that more data should be present. I do beleive that information not relevant enough to be in the country article should be removed in interest of length however if some data is going to be listed then all the data should be listed. And if this is not possible it should be ommitted in its entirety and just be present in the subpage article. Anyways, the information I originally added was only a paragraph in length and included figures such as economic growth, a few sentences of economic projections, and information on the Bolsa de Valores, all of which I beleive are extremley important facts regarding to current and future issues.

[[User:Vivaperucarajo|Vivaperucarajo]] ([[User talk:Vivaperucarajo|talk]]) 03:10, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

:For the record, here is the aforementioned paragraph:
::''In [[2007]], the [[Economy of Peru|Peruvian economy]] grew 9%, the largest growth rate in all of [[South America]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html CIA Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Inflation]] is the lowest in [[Latin America]] at only 1.8% &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2092rank.html CIA World Factbook-Inflation&lt;/ref&gt;''
:Currently (i.e. without this added bit) the &quot;Economy&quot; section provides data on HDI, per capita GDP, percentage of poor population, a breakup of GDP between the different economic sectors, and the country's main exports, plus a little bit on the country's recent economic history. The new paragraph adds the 2007 growth rate, poverty figures for three years instead of one, government growth projections, rate of growth of the Lima Stock Exchange and inflation. Commenting each of these points I think that:
::*A single year's growth rate is not a very meaningful variable as it can vary widely from one year to the next. A more meaningful statement about economic growth is already in the article and reads: ''Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis''. Here we talk about a period of years not just one. Furthermore it seems that the only purpose of this sentence is to add the claim that Peru is the fastest growing nation in South America which is not very humble, not very relevant (one year you can be on top and the next not) and quite chauvinistic. 
::*The most recent poverty figure is already in the article, what's the point of having the last three years? Sure, poverty has receded but it can grow back as easily. The bit on poverty in the added paragraph seems an excess of triumphalism.
::*The same goes for the bit on government forecasts, these are just predictions, not hard data. It is not certain that they'll come true. Plus, it seems totally inappropriate to use an encyclopedic article to voice the president's opinions on how good is government is.  
::*On the Stock Exchange, I think this is quite irrelevant as only a tiny minority of Peruvian enterprises actively participate in the Stock Exchange so it does not say much about the economy of the country as a whole. Furthermore, it seems the only point of this sentence is to mention that it is one of the fastest growing stock exchanges in the world, that is, more nationalism
::*As for inflation, I'd say the same arguments mentioned about economic growth apply here. 
:To summarize, I don't think the new paragraph improves the article, it goes into minor details and is openly chauvinistic. IMHO it would deteriorate an article which is already recognized as on of the best at wiki. --[[User:Victor12|Victor12]] ([[User talk:Victor12|talk]]) 14:55, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

You could make the argument that the economic projections are innececary because as you have said they are not certain, however I do not see how listing real economic figures such as economic growth, stock exchange growth, or inflation qualify as nationalism or as you put it chauvinism. For example if I had written ''&quot;inflation is the lowest in south america at 1.8% making Peru the best economy to invest in South America&quot;'' I could see your point but all I have written are actual facts that are relevant and not added extra adjectives or my own personal opinions. And as nationalism is based on personal opinions what I have written has no relation to nationalism. Additionally, the CIA world factbook served as a refrence for some of my figures and I dont see why the CIA would have Peruvian nationalistic feelings. As for the stock exchange many of the largest mining companies in Peru are listed on this exchange and mining is the largest contigent of the Peruvian economy. Additionally, in any economy a stock exchange is always an important contigent, no matter the overall impact it has. Nevertheless, the companies listed on the BVL are not a &quot;tiny minority&quot; of Peruvian entersprises. I have noticed your concern to do anything to &quot;deteriorate&quot; the article from its current state compromising its recognition as a featured article on wikipedia. I do not beleive that it is a reason to delete information off an article just because of a certain &quot;status&quot; on wikipedia. Regarding some of the claims that some of the figures are unneccecary due to them being not permanent I had thought I solved that according to [[WP:RECENTISM]] by adding an economic history section. Anyways I do not see why listing current economic data goes against [[WP:RECENTISM]] if it is not the only time period that data is listed for. 

--[[User:Vivaperucarajo|Vivaperucarajo]] ([[User talk:Vivaperucarajo|talk]]) 03:08, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

:OK, so now we agree that projections are not appropriate for this article, right? As for the rest:
:*On the stock exchange the claim that ''mining is the largest contigent (sic) of the Peruvian economy'' is a commons misconception. As you can see on [http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/bcr/Memoria-Anual/Memoria-2006.html this report] by the Peruvian Central Bank (see page 204) mining is smaller than agriculture, manufacturing, trade, others services and taxes as a percentage of the GDP. It is only bigger than construction (barely) and fishing so basically the Lima Stock Exchange is still small and not very representative of the economy as a whole.
:*Now on WP:RECENTISM, the problem with putting one year figures for economic growth or inflation is that these numbers don't say much about the country as they only represent the rate of change over the last year. If you say the economy of X country grew 4% you don't give much meaningful info about that country's economy: is it big? is it small? is it undergoing a process of sustainable growth? is that growth temporary, or has it been continuous over the years?

== Seviche ==

Hi.

The official name of the fish dish is now &quot;Seviche&quot;. Although many variations has been accepted (like &quot;Cebiche&quot; or &quot;Sebiche&quot;), the Peruvian Ministry of Production has formalized its name with a [http://www.produce.gob.pe/portal/portal/apsportalproduce/dispositivoslegalespopup?id=14643&amp;codigo=10 Ministerial Resolution]. Now the Seviche even has its own celebration day: June 28. 

I think the section &quot;Culture&quot; of this page (and the label below the Seviche picture) must be updated accordly.

::I disagree, this proposed new image has a clear focus on the blond girl which is at the center of the pic and happens to be the only girl looking at the camera.

:::The point is not to focus on one of the people in the picture, but rather to focus on all three people pictured.

Victor12, you comment that the Amerindian group &quot;happens to be the main contriutor to the current Peruvian demographic composition,&quot; but the article itself states: '' 45% Amerindian, 37% Mestizo (mixed Amerindian and European), 15% White, and 3% black, Japanese, Chinese ''. So by 8% the article is only going to include solely the stereotypical picture of an Amerindian woman, while completely ignoring the Mestizo population. I don't think that's the right thing to do.--[[User:MarshalN20|&amp;#91;&amp;#124;!*//MarshalN20\\*!&amp;#124;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:MarshalN20|talk]]) 16:45, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

::::Actually the focus of the pic is quite important as it is quite obvious that the blond girl is the main subject of the image. BTW, blond people are quite rare in Peru, so this is hardly a representative depiction of Peruvian demographics. As for the Amerindians being the main contributors to the current composition of the Peruvian population I think the numbers are pretty obvious, the &quot;mestizo&quot; group is just the mixture of Amerindian and European so they are also Amerindian to a large extent as you can see by comparing estimates of the native population at the time of the Conquest (even taking into account its demographic collapse) with the numbers of white immigrants to Peru.

A Mestizo is a mixture of both Amerindians and Europeans, as you stated. What bothers me about the current picture is that it is a '''stereotypical''' depiction of Peruvian demographics. I am not asking for the picture to be removed, I'm asking for either a Mestizo to be pictured separately in that same section or for a picture with a better demonstration of Peruvian demographics to be pictured.--[[User:MarshalN20|&amp;#91;&amp;#124;!*//MarshalN20\\*!&amp;#124;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:MarshalN20|talk]]) 21:46, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

::::::Actually, when you say ''if you're going to say that they are &quot;Amerindian to a large extent,&quot; then I can also claim that they are &quot;European to a large extent&quot;'' you are missing my point about the numbers of Amerindians and Europeans. It is quite evident that European immigration could not compare numerically to the native Amerindian population. So, by the numbers alone it is quite clear that Amerindian is the main component of the Peruvian demographics. If that is so I fail to see why you claim this pic to be stereotypical. As for having another pic in this section I don't think the text is big enough to have two pics without going against the Wikipedia Manual of Style, that is without sandwiching text between images. --[[User:Victor12|Victor12]] ([[User talk:Victor12|talk]]) 23:11, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

== Update Urgently Needed ==

The 2009 revolt of rainforest tribal people should not only be mentioned, but have its own in-depth section putting it in context. The context includes:

'''Ethnic Politics:'''
The rise of the indigenous left in Latin America. Examples include the election of ethnically native presidents in Venezuela and Bolivia, the Zapatista movement in Mexico (related to resistance to free trade agreements as well as historic oppression of indigenous people) and in Peru itself, the (often coerced) involvement of Andean natives in the Shining Path movement, and the current support of the Andean people to etnocentric and nationalist para-militar groups such as the Etnocacerista movement of Antauro Humala (The take over of a police station in the town of Andahuaylas in 2005 by the Etnocacerista movement had the support of the mayority of the town's population). The events in Peru are of course related to the Kayapo resistance in Brazil, and similar efforts in Southeast Asia; there is also a parallel with the Nigerian tribal resistance to oil exploitation and resulting environmental damage.

'''Ecological Politics:'''
The environmental / Green movement tends to represent the interests and concerns of 'First World' Caucasians of middle and upper economic strata, and generally limits its tactics and strategies to counterproductive deals with the corporate sector, lobbying (usually without lasting or substantial success) for legislation, and occasional symbolic ritualized confrontations (e.g., Greenpeace presence in whaling operations, anti-nuclear civil disobedience). However, the Peruvian resistance is part of a 500-year-long struggle of colonized peoples to defend their ancient ways of life, which depend on a viable ecosystem with autonomous species living life on their own terms. Since they're facing genocide in most cases, and negotiated agreements are almost invariably broken by their conquerors, these people rarely have the option of moderation.
  
'''Economics:'''
Pressures on rainforests and other natural resources were increased severely by the 1965-1985 era of World Bank loans and IMF demands, and since 1985 by so-called free trade agreements. The Peruvian government's efforts to accelerate the exploitation of the Amazon are presumably an effort to bring Peru into 'the new global economy'. Only when the real value of the Amazon is recognized by the global financial system will the real value of the tribal resistance be fully appreciated.

I don't know enough about the recent events, or about Peru, to contribute the section that's needed. But it seems obvious that these events are of great historical significance, and not only for Peru itself.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chelydra|Chelydra]] ([[User talk:Chelydra|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chelydra|contribs]]) 09:36, 11 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::Title is no longer all caps. The fact that Peru is on the front lines of two of the most historically significant developments of the past two decades (or milennia, depending on your point of view) — the global financial transformations of free trade and finance-driven resource give-aways, and the devastation of the Amazon (not to mention indigineous people) puts this is a different category than the usual news story, and I'm glad to see it's got its own article. THIS page should have a clear link to it (unless I overlooked it).

== Urgent update: Gini index in 2008 ==

According to INEI (National Statistics Institute of Peru) the Gini index in 2008 was 0.479, please check the official document in this link: http://censos.inei.gob.pe/DocumentosPublicos/Pobreza/2008/Informe_Tecnico.pdf

::Although In 1975, during [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]'s presidency, was legally declared Quechua an official language of Peru the status of Quechua in Peruvian society is discussed, noting specific social and political factors contributing to the dying out of the Quechua language, functional domains the language serves, and possible measures to improve its status. The relationship of those functional domains to Peruvian language policies is also explored. An introductory section provides background information on the principles and purposes of language planning, describes Peru's population and the history of its language use and distribution, and reviews recent literature on diglossia and language status planning. The functional domains of Quechua are then outlined in the context of current theory, and ways in which the domains affect Quechua's status in a Spanish-dominated society are considered, particularly in the formation of language policy. It is concluded that despite predictions that Quechua is headed for extinction, there is potential for maintenance of the language in some domains, such as provincial or group domains. While Quechua will never again be the dominant language, it will continue to be valued by the highland communities that continue to speak it. Development of a national daily newspaper, magazine, or radio program in Quechua is suggested as a means of heightening awareness and visibility of the language.

== Angamos Picture ==

I would like to take out this picture from the history section. What purpose does it serve in terms of the Peru article? The other pictures in the article show the independence of Peru, the famed Inca ruins, Peru's geography, etc. However, the Angamos picture depicts a naval loss for Peru in a war that Peru lost as well. It's not as if the country has not won any important wars (Peru has defeated Ecuador twice, defeated Spain twice, etc.), and there have been more important historical matters in Peru beyond the War of the Pacific. I argue that we either free up space in that section by deleting that picture or replacing it with a more modern historical picture (is there not something also representative of Peru?).--[[User:MarshalN20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''MarshalN20'''&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[User_talk:MarshalN20|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''T'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Yellow&quot;&gt;'''a'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Yellow&quot;&gt;'''l'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''k'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 03:57, 24 February 2010 (UTC)

::It takes only a bit of education to learn that infections such as smallpox wiped out large sectors of the Native American population in Peru. Peruvian historiography takes into the account the people of the Viceroyalty of Peru (as far back as the Nueva Castilla era, when Pizarro governed) as part of Peruvian history. Also, note that Native Americans/Amerindians are a diverse group of people that range from the Quechuas (North and South), Aymaras, and the various Amazon tribes. The largest somewhat more homogeneous group of demographics in Peru are the Mestizos, or mixed native and European ancestry (which for the most part is Spanish and native), just like in Chile (where you claim to be writing from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMarshalN20&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=401925665&amp;oldid=401925488]).

I've restored the original text on the demographic decline of the amerindian population, which quotes Cook. Cook is not only a reliable source but the most respected on this subject in the academic world. You can check any modern history of Peru, for instance Klaren's or Hunefeldt's and you'll see him quoted on this topic. Further discussion about Peruvian demographics after the Spanish Conquest should go on the Demographics of Peru or in the Spanish Conquest of Peru articles.

:The main difference between Garcilaso and Porras is that Garcilaso as all other chroniclers is a [[primary source]] whereas Porras is a [[secondary source]], as such, Porras is more reliable having the advantage of writing several centuries after Garcilaso examining a wider variety of sources and having an academic background which allowed him a better analysis.

== Picture of Peruvians ==

I like the pictures chosen. They represent three of the main or traditional racial groups that exist in Peru. However, I find it rather insulting to have only full names for individuals of mainly afro and European descent. We should choose a representative and recognizable individual of mainly indigenous or Quechua extraction displaying his or her full name!!. Options could be Alejandro Toledo, Alberto Pizango, Magaly Solier, Martín Chambi, etc, etc. One more detail, If I am not wrong the number of Afro and Asian Peruvians are very similar. Thus, by not including Asian Peruvians in the mix we are discriminating against this group. Again there are several examples of Asian Peruvians from Alberto and Keiko Fujimori to Erasmo Wong. 
[[User:Viclimay|Viclimay]] ([[User talk:Viclimay|talk]]) 19:47, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
:Formerly, the picture used to be one of an Andean woman and child. The pictures are there to show either a good demographics picture or (in the case one is not available) a current notable person.
:'''Amerindians'''
:The Amerindian man from Pisac is a Featured Image (regarded as one of the best by the community). He does not have a name for the public, but the picture exemplifies the culture of the demographic group (which is the purpose of the picture). In that sense, there is no need for the picture to be changed.
:'''Notable people'''
:When there is a lack of a good demographics picture, the article resorts to current globally notable people . In this case we have Jefferson Farfan, who is a symbol of both Peruvian sports and the Afro-Peruvian. The article also shows Mantilla, a European Peruvian who serves mainly to show Peruvian women (Yes, she is a former model, so it's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek picture). Ideally, if you can find a better picture of these demographic groups, there would be no need to have notable people.
:In regards to Asians, remember that we have to include currently famous people. In this aspect Wong is not currently notable. Considering the [[history of Peru]], including Keiko or Alberto Fujimori in a demographics section is both a political statement and not a very appropiate one (especially since Alberto Fujimori has been condemned by the Peruvian Judicial system).

I do agree with you on the use of political figures because they can be highly controversial. However, they are not the only Asian Peruvians. They seem to be very active in the making of the Peruvian culinary boom. e.g. Javier Wong (who is often described as a guru of Peruvian ceviche), Humberto Sato (owner of Costanera 700 arguably the best sea food restaurant in the country). Regarding the picture of the man from Pisac I actually like it and I will put it on it's own. However, the way this selection was chosen or edited might misled, unintentionally, some readers into thinking that there is not any notable Peruvian of mainly indigenous background.

:::The question of whether this information should be included in this article (Peru), I still incline towards the negative. Just ask two questions: Why is this important for Peru? and Did this have any relevant consequences on Peruvian history? In the end the capital remained at Lima, and really no one even remembers Belaunde Terry attempting to make a change. Compare this to [[Brasilia]], for instance, which did have a huge impact on Brazil during its construction and a long-lasting impact on the nation's future.--[[User:MarshalN20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''MarshalN20'''&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[User_talk:MarshalN20|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''T'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Yellow&quot;&gt;'''a'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Yellow&quot;&gt;'''l'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''k'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:54, 24 October 2011 (UTC)
::::I think you are probably right. Although Belaunde Terry's efforts are long forgotten, from the BBC programme it would seem that the main lasting effect has been in the road network that was forged to try and realise his failed dream. This will probably continue to be further developed as time goes by, even without any new capital to connect to. I would guess that Belaunde Terry and his cronies were probably greatly inspired by Brasilia. Many thanks.

== Discrete subgroups? ==

A sentence in the introduction stated:

&quot;The Peruvian population, estimated at 29.5 million, is [[Multiethnic society|multiethnic]], including [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[White Latin American|Europeans]], [[African Latin American|Africans]], and [[Asian Latin American|Asians]]&quot;

There are a few issues here that are debatable. First, this presents the Peruvian population as if it could be split into several discrete entities. (I have no problems, in general, with the word &quot;multiethnic&quot;, except when -- as seems to be the case here -- it is used to reinforce an impression that society can in fact be divided into separate &quot;ethnicities&quot;; this is never fully the case, and in Peru's case it is rather far from the truth.) Now, while racial discrimination is certainly still a part of the realities of life in Peru, it is also the case that Peruvians live in a very mixed society; there are, say, class lines, but these have at most a 'correlation' with phenotype.

Key points:
* Very few Peruvians descend from a single human group. 
* Putting &quot;mestizo&quot; alongside other groups does not solve the problem. &quot;Mestizo&quot; denotes a separate caste, if you wish, which did exist in Colonial times, or a more vaguely defined social stratum that had some reality in much of the highlands up to the mid-20th century. (Even in the highlands, your mileage could vary; in my perception, society in, for example, Cajamarca tended to perceive itself mostly along the lines of 'vecinos' vs. 'campesinos', where the latter could very well be of largely Spanish extraction.)
* The notion of &quot;ethnic group&quot;, as a popular concept, is arguably a mid-20th Anglo-Saxon invention that did not have much currency in Peru until very recently. 
* Shortly after independence, the Republic abolished the notion of a division of citizens into two separate bodies of &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Spaniards&quot;, at least in the official ideology. Of course, reality lagged far behind for a long time; still, this classical liberal notion of citizenship - not the notion of &quot;ethnicity&quot; - was the ideology inculcated at school.
* Race has not, as far as I am aware, used in the census for half a century. (This is why the &quot;Indian/White&quot; percentages sometimes given are from so far back.)
* Peruvians are not Europeans, Africans or Asians; they can *descend* from Europeans, Africans or Asians.
* &quot;European&quot; linked to the controversial page &quot;White Latin American&quot;. It is a reality of life that having a light complexion (preferably associated with some money) will get you classified as &quot;white&quot; in some people's minds, and this will affect your life in some (possibly both positive and completely unwelcome) ways. However, stating that &quot;White Latin Americans&quot; are an objectively existing, well-defined group is much more controversial. There are people who imagine themselves to be white, surely...

::Your opinions, while interesting, are not what matter in the article. The introduction is nothing more than a summary of what is presented in the article. The first paragraph of the Demographics section is what contains the relevant information to this particular paragraph in the introduction. I included the term &quot;Mestizo&quot; because not only is it still used in Peru (and other parts of Latin America; and even by the CIA as can be seen in the [[Mestizo]] article), but because I do believe that most Peruvians fall into that category (from personal experience; of course, the larger number still being the Amerindians). However, as you challenged it and the term is not validated in the Demographics section, then I removed it as well.
::Taking your point into account, what I find an easy solution the matter would be to include &quot;descendants of&quot; after the word &quot;including&quot; (i.e., &quot;The Peruvian population, estimated at 29.5 million, is multiethnic, including '''descendants of''' Amerindians, Europeans, Africans, and Asians). Alternatively the following can also be used: &quot;The Peruvian population, estimated at 29.5 million, is multiethnic, including people of Amerindian, European, African, and Asian descendency&quot;. I hope this satisfies your thoughts.

::Either of the last two formulations is an improvement of the current version, though &quot;descendency&quot; should really be &quot;descent&quot;. It would seem even better to have a formulation that does not seem to include the fact - on which we seem to agree - that most Peruvians have more than one kind of descent. What about &quot;... is multiethnic; Amerindian, European, African and Asian descent are all significant&quot; (or: common)? [[User:Feketekave|Feketekave]] ([[User talk:Feketekave|talk]]) 17:39, 27 January 2012 (UTC)

::- and, by the way, talking about broader issues is unavoidable. Critical analysis of data (by you or by me) is essential in any sort of writing, and cannot be brushed aside as mere &quot;opinion&quot;. As the article [[Mestizo]] itself shows, 'mestizaje' is a very complex notion, involving not just 'racial' but cultural mixing and a particular kind of national identity. [[User:Feketekave|Feketekave]] ([[User talk:Feketekave|talk]]) 17:41, 27 January 2012 (UTC)

Incidentally, the &quot;ethnic groups&quot; percentages in the infobox are extremely debatable (as is the notion that such clearly defined things exist nowadays...). Yes, it is sourced - to the CIA World Factbook (which has a frankly bad reputation; it is not a scholarly source). More damningly, the figures seem to come from the 1940 census! (As I was saying before - it was the last census in Peru in which people were defined in this fashion, and so it is what is often used by foreign sources looking desperately for percentages.)

:::Regarding your argument, I am not brushing it aside (and pardon me if you got such an impression). It is exactly because I understand what you are presenting (and I do agree with your central point) that I do not deny that a change is indeed necessary.

If you can provide reliable sources to &quot;strenghten&quot; (for the sake of redundancy, remember that I already agree with your point) your proposal, that would be a much better stand from which to discuss the situation.
:::I am assuming that whoever reviewed the article (to give it the FA-class), must have seen and accepted the CIA World Factbook. Per [[WP:AGF]], of course.

Hello. Regarding the demographics subsection I noticed that the images in the section comprise of a black Peruvian and two white Peruvians. I believe it is undue weight to have two pictures of white Peruvians while there are none of Indigenous Peruvians (who represent a large part of the population) and Asian Peruvians (who have influenced modern Peru greatly). Could someone please explain to me why the page is currently set up this way? [[User:V.S.Gonzalez|V.S.Gonzalez]] ([[User talk:V.S.Gonzalez|talk]]) 02:05, 5 February 2012 (UTC)

:It's not intentional. The pictures are meant to display ''current notable'' Peruvians (in a world sense, not just Peru). The image of ''Maria Julia Mantilla'' should no longer be on it since her notability has diminished, but no one has found a better image so far. If you can find a better image of a current non-white notable Peruvian (preferably a female), then go ahead and change it. The image should preferably have a left-leaning angle, but a forward picture (like the ''Vargas Llosa'' one) is good as well.
:So, as you can tell, it's a complicated matter. Perhaps you might wonder ''why'' we are using ''current notable'' Peruvians? I was the one that made the change as, whichever way you look at it, using &quot;notable&quot; or &quot;non-notable&quot; individuals are discriminative forms of stereotyping a society. In other words, it's equally stereotypical to pick a &quot;notable&quot; or a &quot;non-notable&quot;. What makes the difference is that the &quot;notables&quot; are actually relevant persons (most people looking at the article can click on their names and learn more about them), whereas &quot;non-notables&quot; do not have that option.

== Peruvians apparently speaking &quot;Klingon.&quot; Possible page vandalism? ==

&quot;The Peruvian population consists of 69 llamas and one very lonely redditor. The main spoken language is Klingon, although a significant number of Peruvians speak l33t or other chatspeak languages. This mixture of pop culture has resulted in a wide diversity of lolcats in fields such as art, memes, cuisine, literature, and music.&quot;

As amusing as this was to read, I'm thinking maybe this isn't the correct tone for a Wikipedia article. At least, not without some citations to back this up.--dkamouflage 18:00, 17 May 2013 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dkamouflage|Dkamouflage]] ([[User talk:Dkamouflage|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dkamouflage|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::We have more than 69 llamas, and we have also alpacas and vicunas, whose wool is very expensive in European markets and we are very proud of it. Also, we don't speak Klingon, we speak Quechua, a native language. Very few countries in the world can show population speaking their own native language (especially in Latin America, only Paraguay) our language is spoken in Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina, so those countries also speak Klingon, I mean Quechua.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/190.116.20.253|190.116.20.253]] ([[User talk:190.116.20.253|talk]]) 13:44, 25 April 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Flag ==

I have a question... As far as I'm concerned, Peruvian law specifies that the state flag (the one on the article) shall only be used for government affairs, while the civil flag (without coat of arms) is to be used elsewhere; in fact, the civil flag is the one used in both the Spanish article for &quot;[[es:Perú|Peru]]&quot; and the English article for &quot;[[Flag of Peru]]&quot;. So, shouldn't the civil flag be featured on the infobox instead of the state flag? --[[User:Fluence|Fluence]] ([[User talk:Fluence|talk]]) 22:14, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

:You are right. It has been repeatedly stated that the flag should be the civil flag.
:However, the people that keep repeatedly changing it have this strange notion that the state flag looks nicer, or that it is the &quot;official flag&quot;.

:The latest edits on religion are a problem. First, we should never use a site such as [http://www.amautaspanish.com/] as a source - this is a commercial Spanish language school being used as a source on the Peruvian constitution. As a source it would never pass FA (or hopefully GA). Secondly, the paragraph &quot;The majority of towns, cities and villages have its own official cathedral or church and patron saint. Particular religious days are noted annually. These forms of activities are focal events and play central roles in the life of all sizes and kinds of community. The costs for the said affairs depend on the size of the community. Both spiritual devotion and hope are to serve in community affairs for prestige and possibly political purposes. The most famous of these activities are the patron festivals that are celebrated yearly. Peru’s constitution gives its citizen religious freedom.&quot; seems unnecessary and maybe confusing. What is an &quot;official cathedral or church and patron saint&quot;? If these are actually official, ie the town or city has made an official statement, that needs to be clarified. Secondly, do we need to tell people all this and if so is this the best way to do it? Of course religious celebrations are held, that's part of almost every religion (although not all). Obviously costs vary according to size of the community (although presumably this isn't always the case, a rich small community may be able to afford more than a larger poor one). What does &quot;Both spiritual devotion and hope are to serve in community affairs for prestige and possibly political purposes.&quot; actually mean? After writing this I stopped and decided to search for it. I've found it at [http://prezi.com/l6naodb6kfow/alayshia-grisham-lacy/] as part of a longer piece evidently written by a student and a shorter version at [http://www.studylands.com/guide/PE-religion.htm].

Hi, 

The Ceviche pic is not right, because the pic contains an ingredient that is not typical of ceviche. (Ceviche does not contain seeweed/yuyo.) Seeweed is not used in peru at all.

Please replace the pic with a real pic. 

We have seen in Peru a persistent attempt by the Japanese to change Peru's gastronomic history in order to try to claim a link to Peru and its culture. 

I am 100% peruvian.

The map that appears as being &quot;from the mid 1820's&quot; is in fact a map made in Colombia by the times this country was at war with Peru. Does not reflect the actual claims of Peruvian territory by those times, and Tubmbes, Jaen and Maynas appear as &quot;Ecuadorian&quot; (in a year when Ecuador did not even exist) the map is inaccurate, biased and chauvinist, and what's worst, places Peruvian cities (Jaen, Iquitos, etc) that have been 100% Peruvian since ancient times, in foreign territory.
