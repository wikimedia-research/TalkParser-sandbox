[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Rcsprinter123|Rcsprinter123]]. I wanted to let you know that I reverted one of [[Special:Contributions/2601:6:74C0:F84:38F2:425D:475B:D2A8|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;—the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grill%20%28jewelry%29&amp;diff=660500561 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Grill (jewelry)]]— because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Rcsprinter123|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:verdana; font-size:10pt; color:#DC143C&quot;&gt;Rcsprinter&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]  ''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:9.5pt; color:#488AC7&quot;&gt;(engage)&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;@&lt;/small&gt; 21:59, 2 May 2015 (UTC)
