[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:IronGargoyle|IronGargoyle]]. I wanted to let you know that I reverted one of [[Special:Contributions/67.149.226.13|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;—the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29&amp;diff=660828184 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)]]— because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:IronGargoyle|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:IronGargoyle|IronGargoyle]] ([[User talk:IronGargoyle|talk]]) 20:14, 4 May 2015 (UTC)
