==Proposed deletion of JESS3==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]
A [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] template has been added to the article [[JESS3]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:&lt;b&gt;Fails [[WP:CORP]]&lt;/b&gt;

All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice should explain why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:JESS3|its talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because, even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; [[User:RadioFan|RadioFan]] ([[User talk:RadioFan|talk]]) 03:36, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

::FYI I think you should put your argument in favor of JESS3 back into the deletion debate with a note that you wrote most of the article. Your opinion still counts for something, and a well reasoned argument holds more weight than you might suppose from the harsh warnings people throw around like candy here.--[[User:CastAStone|CastAStone]][[User talk:CastAStone|/&lt;sup&gt;/₵₳$↑₳&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/CastAStone|&lt;sup&gt;₴₮ʘ№€&lt;/sup&gt;]] 03:26, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
