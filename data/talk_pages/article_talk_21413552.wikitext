==Sid the Science Kid episodes==
Hello,

Where did you get the titles and cycle themes for the ''[[Sid the Science Kid]]'' episodes (#30-40) that you added to the article? They conflict with all other sources - which list the final cycles as weather and the body (not weather and space) and I can't find the titles [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sid_the_Science_Kid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=268771930 you posted] used anywhere else. Also according to the Jim Henson Company press releases and the show's official website, the other cycles are &quot;simple machines&quot; and &quot;backyard science&quot; (not &quot;inventions&quot; and &quot;home habitats&quot;).

Also, all 40 episodes were produced as a single season. The first 20 episodes first aired from September to November and then were rerun for 2-3 months; and now the second 20 episodes, the second half of the season, is getting ready to air from February - May. Episode 21 is just a mid-season premiere kicking off the new batch of season 1 episodes, it is not the premiere of new season.

Thanks. - [[User:BradFraggle|BradFraggle]] ([[User talk:BradFraggle|talk]]) 22:05, 5 February 2009 (UTC)


==[[wikiasite:HDPS|Sid the Science Kid's own wiki!]]==
Hello again,
I see you are somewhat a fan of ''Sid the Science Kid'', and thought I'd let you that that there is a new [[wikiasite:HDPS|HDPS Wiki]] on Wikia -- http://hdps.wikia.com/. The new wiki covers the productions of the Jim Henson Company's [[wikiasite:HDPS|Digitial Performance Studio]] in detail -- including in-depth coverage of the characters, episodes, songs, merchandise and other topics related to ''[[wikiasite:HDPS:Sid the Science Kid|Sid the Science Kid]]''. This new wiki project is still very much in its infancy and we could use your help, input, creativity, ideas and expertise. So if you are interested in this topic, feel free to check the wiki out and (just like here on Wikipedia) feel free to pitch in wherever you feel comfortable. Thanks. -- [[User:BradFraggle|BradFraggle]] ([[User talk:BradFraggle|talk]]) 09:05, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
