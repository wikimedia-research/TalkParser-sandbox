== Deletion discussion about [[Milan Nikolić (born 1988)]] ==
Hello, Sandra0412, 

I wanted to let you know that there's a discussion about whether Milan Nikolić (born 1988) should be deleted. Your comments are welcome at  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Milan Nikolić (born 1988) ]]. 

If you're new to the process, [[WP:AFD|articles for deletion]] is a group discussion (not a vote!) that usually lasts seven days. If you need it, there is a guide on [[WP:DISCUSSAFD|how to contribute]]. Last but not least, you are highly encouraged to continue improving the article; just be sure not to remove the tag about the deletion nomination from the top. 

Thanks, [[User:Crystallizedcarbon|Crystallizedcarbon]] ([[User talk:Crystallizedcarbon|talk]]) 19:53, 24 January 2015 (UTC)

Hello, I noticed that you recently created a new page, '''[[:Milan Nikolić (born 1988)]]'''. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page – '''[[:Milan Nikolić (footballer, born 1987)]]'''. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for [[WP:A10|speedy deletion]]. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at [[:Milan Nikolić (footballer, born 1987)]] – you might like to discuss new information at [[Talk:Milan Nikolić (footballer, born 1987)|the article's talk page]]. 

If you think the article you created should remain separate, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Milan Nikolić (born 1988)|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the [[WP:AFC|article creation process]] and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 04:27, 25 January 2015 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Milan Nikolić (born 1988)]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G4|section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a [[Wikipedia:Deletion debates|deletion debate]], {{#if:|at [[{{{2}}}]]|such as at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]}}. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Milan Nikolić (born 1988)|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;.
