==Reverted redirect==
I reverted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parodies_of_Harry_Potter&amp;diff=154586440&amp;oldid=154219767 this redirect] that destroyed a deal of properly researched and cited material that is not duplicated at the destination. [[User:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon]] 13:52, 30 August 2007 (UTC)
:2 articles of similar content don't need to exist, just because the user that created this..didn't know about the list in the first place. Move relevant content to that list page, then redirect. It seems like a simple concept to me. [[User:RobJ1981|RobJ1981]] 04:26, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

==I'm moving this list here==

Tanya Grotter spinoffs. I just don't see the relevance of this unless they can be expanded beyond merely mentioning the titles:

:1. Мефодий Буслаев: Маг Полуночи (Methodius Buslaev: Magician of Midnight)
:2. Мефодий Буслаев: Свиток желаний (Methodius Buslaev: Roll of Desire)

==Poll: The future of the merge==
The current article is a five-way merge between [[Parry Potter]], [[Porri Gatter]], [[Wizard People, Dear Reader]], [[Tanya Grotter]] and [[List of Harry Potter parodies]].  This poll is for the purpose of deciding whether the article should remain complete or be divided back into its five sections.  Post '''Break''' if you think it should be broken back up or '''Keep''' if you think it should be retained. 

&lt;s&gt;'''Break'''. There's plenty of good (though unsourced) information in these articles, which would have to be trimmed further if a merge with [[List of Harry Potter parodies]] were to take place. I say go back to the way things were, so that the old information can be reinstated. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:56, 7 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
'''Keep'''. I don't think this information is ever going to be properly sourced. Until it is, it should be radically shortened and kept on this list. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:24, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

'''Break''' for same reasons. [[User:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon]] 19:15, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

'''Break''': Agreed, I would like to see that the information is trimmed down so that way the material is still present but there will not be be any excessive details. -[[User:Adv193|Adv193]] 20:14, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

'''Keep''' - I was intending to advocate a further merge, as this has now been done, I advocate its retention.  The combined page is a list with clear inclusion criteria (although there are a few dubious entries in the &quot;other&quot; section) which successfully combines several topics which, while independently notable, are unlikely ever to be able to draw upon a sufficiently wide base of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to create articles of decent length and quality.

:'''Comment''' - I have posted a notice on the WP:HP noticeboard inviting comments from other editors.  [[User:Happy-melon|Happy-melon]] 20:39, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;'''Complex'''&lt;/s&gt; I think that Barry Trotter and the Pet Rock parodies have shown a significant amount of reliable secondary sourcing, and if someone wants to continue to expand them, I would not oppose a split. I think continuing to expand them in the proper encyclopedic style, however, is key. I think the other three parodies do not currently show enough sourcing or other indicators of importance to show a need to be split from this article. I strongly oppose splitting off the &quot;list&quot; article as this article is now the equivalent of it, that is, a general analysis of HP parodies and a home for parodies that do not have a need for their own article. -- '''[[User:Basar|Basar]]''' ([[User talk:Basar|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Basar|contribs]]) 21:32, 7 September 2007 (UTC)
:'''Comment''': The Pet Rock article was essentially an ad created by the author attempting to use Wikipedia as a selling platform. If it stays I think it should be severely curtailed, so I'm not sure it deserves its own article. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:29, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:::''I think the other three parodies do not currently show enough sourcing or other indicators of importance''
:::I already reverted the redirect on [[Tanya Grotter]]. There's no lack of secondary sources -  [http://news.google.co.uk/archivesearch?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;um=1&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22Tanya+Grotter%22] - and within Russia it has become an ongoing and popular series in its own right. My Russian is very creaky; it'd be useful if someone proper;y conversant with Russian could help find sources (eg reviews) commenting on the content rather than the invariable Western focus on the court case. [[User:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon]] 12:13, 8 September 2007 (UTC)
::::As it stands, that article is completely unsourced, so much so that much of it could have been invented by a Russian-speaking prankster and we wouldn't know. Hell, who here even knows enough Cyrillic to say that that isn't just a random series of squiggles? I'm half for deleting the article entirely until someone is willing to go the whole hog and source it. I'm not even sure why reviews of the books themselves are relevant, seeing as this is the English language Wikipedia, and no one in the English speaking world is ever going to read those books. They're only relevant as regards their relationship to ''Harry Potter.'' Ergo, I don't think listing spinoffs is particularly helpful. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:17, 8 September 2007 (UTC)
:::::[[WP:AGF]]. Besides, it's verifiable. Even if you don't read Russian, it's not difficult to use Google's language tools to get enough of a translation to confirm, say, the  [http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.grotter.ru%2Fmain.phtml%3Fmenu%3Dbook&amp;langpair=ru%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools  book titles]. This is, anyway, applying a criterion for verifiability where there's been previous debate even about the Potter books themselves: often the only source about what goes on inside a book is first-hand reportage from a reader. As for the &quot;English speaking Wikipedia&quot; argument: this is [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias|systemic bias]]. We don't not cover texts because they're not currently in English: for instance, Mishima's novel [[Kyoko's House]] has never been translated.

::::::Restoring the [[Tanya Grotter]] article is fundamentally unhelpful and rather disruptive to this poll. It has created duplicated live text which is prohibited by [[WP:CFORK]].

:::::::::I don't think that's necessary. If he can expand the article enough for it to stand on its own (particularly by sourcing the book titles and by elaborating on plot points) then I think this article can link to a main article and keep a stub of the article here. That said, a lot of the material in [[Tanya Grotter]] is probably uncitable, particularly the &quot;Similarities&quot; section, which reads like an essay. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:36, 8 September 2007 (UTC)
::::::::::Thx. I've worked on the sourcing a bit, and found some news items that assert a bit more notability (i.e. sales and reader poll rankings). I agree about the character/plot comparisons being problematical; they are technically [[WP:NOR|OR]], but not unusual on Wikipedia for articles on derivative works (check out [[Bored of the Rings]]). Still, I've put an ''unreferenced'' tag on that section, and have no objection to it being snipped if no specific verification is found.

'''Comment''' leaning towards break but not about to explain entire position right now - ''Wizard People'' is fairly major, and should not be left unbroken on the basis of unimportance. I remarked on [[Talk:Wizard_People%2C_Dear_Reader#Listing_found_sourcing]] that it has full-length articles in both ''Salon'' and ''The New York Times'', along with a few lesser ones, but they hadn't been integrated into the article at the time of the merge, a short while after. --[[User:Kizor|Kizor]] 01:15, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

==Doujinshi==
I've never encountered this before; is doujinshi any different from fanfic?

:Doujinshi are fan made comics that are usually sold or distributed in fan conventions.  Basically fan fiction with pictures rather than text, so I wouldn't put them here.  I don't know if any specific ones could be considered notible, but the fact that they exist could go under [[Harry Potter fandom]]. [[User:Hewinsj|Hewinsj]] 15:09, 24 September 2007 (UTC)
==What needs to happen==
Some kind of consensus needs to be reached concering which online examples are notable and which should be ditched.

Also, Barry Trotter and Wizard People should be properly cited and then it must be determined whether they should be given their own articles.

I think that's because it's not a parody (ie an attempt to make fun of it by changing it slightly).
