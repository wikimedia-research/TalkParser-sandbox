[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Using different styles throughout the encyclopedia, as you did in [[:Spokespersonâ€Ž]], makes it harder to read.

==Edit warring==
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=456982185&amp;oldid=456981845 edit] User [[User:Klegein]] and [[User:Dia^]] appear to be involved in a content dispute. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spokesperson&amp;action=history Revision history of Spokesperson] verges on being an [[WP:Edit War]] in which case both editors may be blocked. I do not see either of these editors engaging in meaningful discussion on any related talk page. As Klegein has very few edits I would remind Dia^ to review [[WP:BITE]]. Posting on both talk pages.
