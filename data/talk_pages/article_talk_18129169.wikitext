==Fruitless search for references==
I looked for any references to Ving as a drink as claimed - just something that could be cited in the article. I could not find any on the web. I am unconvinced that this article has a place in WP. Cheers. [[User:Hebrides|Hebrides]] 09:42, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

It's kind of a local thing, I think.... hence the no references.
