[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Qed237|Qed237]]. I noticed that you made an edit concerning content related to a living person{{spaces|1}}on [[:Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]], but that you didnâ€™t support your changes with a [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citation to a reliable source]], so I removed it. Wikipedia has a strict policy concerning [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|how we write about living people]], so please help us keep such articles accurate. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Qed237|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-biog1 --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;[[User:Qed237|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''''QED'''''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''''237'''''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Qed237|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;('''''talk''''')&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:26, 3 February 2014 (UTC)
