== Reprobation ==

Thanks for the heads up.  But, quite frankly, I'm losing interest in Wikipedia.  I don't have time to police the idiots.  With a virtually unlimited number of editors, the result will always be the lowest common denominator -- verbose, second rate mediocrity.  :-) [[User:Jim Ellis|Jim Ellis]] 19:32, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

: Harrumph.  All of our verbose mediocrity is first rate!  — [[User:Mkmcconn|Mark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User_Talk:Mkmcconn|Mkmcconn]])&lt;/small&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn|**]] 19:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

[[User_talk:Sam_Spade#another_user|Thank you for the note you left on my talk page]]. We share some interests, perhaps we should collaborate sometime. Maybe I'll have a look at your to-do list ;) Cheers, [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 16:46, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

==Wikichristian==

Hi KHM03

This is Graham here, from wikichristian. I've been browsing wikipedia and I recognized your name. I see you've been a prolific contributor to wikipedia. Wow! I just wanted to let you know that wikichristian is now at www.wikichristian.org (not .com). It's slowly moving along - it grown a little. Perhaps not as much as I would have hoped - but it's in God's hands - if he wants it to grow, it will. Come by and let me know how you think it is going. Let me know if you think there are major flaws or problems with it.

I was actually browsing through the categories section looking at &quot;Christian wikipedians&quot; when I noticed your name. I've sent the following message to other wikipedians in the Christian category to let them know about wikichristian. I've pasted the message here so you can see the direction wikichristian is taking. Tell me what you think...

: Come and take a look at [http://www.wikichristian.org www.wikichiristian.org] and consider contributing. It is still small and has very few users. I'm praying that God helps the site to grow and become a forum for Christians to write and read about all aspects of Christianity. It is not meant to be a copy of wikipedia. It is not meant to be purely an encyclopedia. For any given topic, it will hopefully contain a short summary of the topic followed by links to many sub-articles - some containing simple facts; some sharing experiences; some explaining a particular viewpoint and so on.

: Take for example the article on [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Grace grace]. It has various &quot;Definition and explanation&quot; articles explaining the meaning of grace. It has a few &quot;Articles / opinions&quot; about grace. It has links for &quot;Quotes' about grace and links to &quot;Songs about grace&quot;. The site is also meant to be a resource site containing information about Christian texts, literature, art, music, radio, television and internet.

: Take a look at the example article on the song [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Shout_to_the_Lord_%28song%29 Shout to the Lord]. It has links to information about the song, lyrics and chords to the song and links for comments or opinions to be expressed about the song.

: The site also intends to explain the history of important events in Christianity. Take a look at [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=The_Reformation The Reformation] section. This has links for &quot;Overview&quot; articles, &quot;Opinion&quot; articles, &quot;Quotes&quot; and &quot;Travel&quot; stories.

: The site intends to be a reference about major (and minor) figures in the Bible, the early church and today. Take a look at [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=John_Stott John Stott]. It contains &quot;Overview&quot; and &quot;Opinion&quot; articles. It contains texts of &quot;Talks&quot; given by John Stott and links to &quot;Books&quot; by John Stott.

: In summary, I suppose, that my hope is that WikiChristian becomes a major reference point for Christians and non-Christians to go to find about any issue related to Christianity. I don't believe that this should be carbon-copy of wikipedia. It should resemble it in some ways, but in other ways, it should be quite different in structure and evolution. I realize that there are different views about different topics - and accordingly, there should always be the opportunity for a person to write his personal view under the &quot;Opinion and articles&quot; section of any given page.

: I would love you to take a look at wikichristian and contribute. If you don't wish to contribute, would you consider visiting it's world wide directory of churches we are setting up and entering your church into the database. The point of the database is to state the location of a church with the service times and add a brief description of the church. You can take a look for example at: [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Directory_listing_of_churches_around_the_world Church Directory] -&gt; [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Churches_in_Australia Australia] -&gt; [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Churches_in_South_Australia South Australia] -&gt; [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=Churches_in_Adelaide_and_its_suburbs Adelaide] -&gt; [http://www.wikichristian.org/index.php?title=St_Matthew%27s_and_St_Bart%27s_Anglican_Churches_in_Adelaide%2C_South_Australia St Matthew's Anglican Church]

Thanks for your time.

==[[User:Who|Who]]'s RfA== Thank you for supporting my [[User:Who|masters]] RfA. He appreciates your support and comments and looks forward to better serving Wikipedia the best he can.

== Can you help me? ==

Hi,
Have you made the last post in my user talk page? Actually the first one is by you. And what exactly should I take the post's meaning. I mean, as far as I got it, I think I am not going good? 

Thanks if you can help! [[User:PassionInfinity|PassionInfinity]] 19:43, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

== My RfA! ==

My dear KHM03, I simply wanted to drop by now that my RfA is closed to give you a big THANK YOU! for your kind support. It came at a very important time to me, when I felt I was being somewhat distrusted, and your confidence gave me strength. I hope that we continue to be in contact in the future, and you have in me a new friend. Hugs!

==[[Binitarianism]]==
Hi Keith.  I've noticed that you've noticed the Church of God writer, who has been adding the COG view to articles.  It's evidently the same fellow who was doing the same thing under an anonymous IP (no problem with that, just clarifying who I'm talking about).

His first full-length article, explaining his perspective, has been created at [[Binitarianism]].  I'd like you (and others who watch your talk) to look at that article, and see if you might have some ideas for how to conform it to wp-npov. — [[User:Mkmcconn|Mark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User_Talk:Mkmcconn|Mkmcconn]])&lt;/small&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn|**]] 19:05, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

KHM03,&lt;br/&gt;
Hi.  I'll try and be as polite as possible.  Except in the case of vandalsim, simply reverting someone's changes is considered poor form.  Reverting to ''your own version'' is quite bad form.  You may have views that differ from mine, the appropiate place to work them out is on the article's talk page, not via edit summary.  I'll look forward to seeing you [[Talk:Bible#External_links|there]]. &lt;br/&gt;[[User:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;brenneman&lt;/font&gt;]][[User Talk:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

==Tent revival==
Keith, do you think that you might help to fill out the articles that have to do with tent revivalism? I'm surprised to find that there no entries on [[Tent revival]], [[Chautauqua tent]], [[Chautauqua circuit]], [[Big top revival]], or [[Gospel tabernacle]]; and the articles on [[Chautauqua Institute]] and [[Camp meeting]] give only slight indication of the breadth of the movement or size of the phenomenon.  [[Chautauqua movement]] redirects to the institution (which is imperfectly accurate). — [[User:Mkmcconn|Mark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User_Talk:Mkmcconn|Mkmcconn]])&lt;/small&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn|**]] 17:18, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
:Mark...I'll try and get to those and see what I can do.  I admit, however, that the Chautauqua/tent revival/Holiness movement aspect of Methodism is not my area of expertise.  I'll see what I can do.  Got to go...meeting with the Bishop tonight about strategic planning in our Conference.  Good, Holy Spirit stuff.  Good luck tonight monitoring Wikipedia; I'll be MIA.

KHM03, &lt;br/&gt;
While doing some cleanup, I've found some transclusions of yours.  So here's the boilerplate: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:#F9F9F9; border:1px solid #AAA; padding:5px; width: 650px;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Info-pictogram.png|left]]
When using template tags on talk pages, don't forget to [[m:Help:Template#subst|substitute with text]] by adding '''subst:''' to the template tag. For example, use {{subst:&lt;nowiki&gt;test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This reduces server load and prevents accidental blanking of the template.&lt;/div&gt;Keep up the good work! - [[User:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;brenneman&lt;/font&gt;]][[User Talk:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color=&quot;#2f4f4f&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:08, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

==[[Historical persecution by Christians]]==
You might be interested in the [[Historical persecution by Christians]] article, and the dispute about the &quot;Modern&quot; section.

==Book of Common Prayer==
Thanks for the greeting!  I was really struck by your quote from Wesley &quot;I believe there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety, than the Common Prayer of the Church of England...&quot;  [[Thomas Cranmer]] is of course, the greatest liturgist in the history of the English language.  [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/everyman_history/index.htm This History of the BCP] is a great read.  The author, echoing Wesley's words says that: &quot;We may be confident that liturgical worship is the best of all. There is some loss in the use of printed words; but there is a greater gain. We have in them the accumulated wisdom and beauty of the Christian Church, the garnered excellence of the saints. We are by them released from the accidents of time and place. Above all we are preserved against the worst dangers of selfishness: in the common prayer we join together in a great fellowship that is as wide as the world; and we are guided, not by the limited notions of our own priest, nor by the narrow impulses of our own desires, but by the mighty voice that rises from the general heart of Christendom.&quot;  

People just don't write like that anymore do they?  Anyway that's my random thought of the day inspired by your User page.  :-) --[[User:Circuitloss|circuitloss]] 17:31, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks for the welcome and greeting! ==

Hi there, my anonymous fellow presbyter!

Although I've known of Wikipedia for years now, and have occasionally used it,
for some reason it didn't dawn on me to contribute or edit Wikipedia. (I have
contributed to Zeal.com in the past, but not lately.) Starting out with a
quick research question I asked Google today, I wound up surfing the
[[apostolic succession]] and [[independent Catholic churches]] entries of Wikipedia
today and released I needed to chip in and tweak them a bit.

For 14 years I've been a researcher (and participant) in the field
of Independent Catholicism/Old Catholicism, and I maintain the web site
Ind-Movement.org.

I also searched the wiki for mentions of &quot;altar bread&quot; and came up on
the tiny, overly pious and narrow entry someone created for [[Sacramental Bread]].
For now, since I'm pressed for time, I only added a bibliographical reference
to my book on said subject. At some point I feel I need to completely rewrite
and amplify that entry.
