[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, adding content without [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citing]] a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]]{{#if:|, as you did to [[:{{{1}}}]],}} is not consistent with our policy of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability]]. Take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia.

Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:I Refuse]] has been reverted. Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I_Refuse&amp;diff=235488070&amp;oldid=235371996 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove [[WP:NOT#REPOSITORY|unwanted links]] and [[WP:SPAM|spam]] from Wikipedia.  The external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.	 The external links I reverted were matching the following [[regex|regex rule(s)]]: rule: '\byoutube\.com' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[Wikipedia:Media|media]] file (e.g. an [[Wikipedia:Images|image]] or a [[Wikipedia:Media help|sound or video]] file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's [[WP:COPYRIGHT|copyright policy]] and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our [[Wikipedia:Upload|upload]] facility to upload a suitable media file. If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[blog]], [[forum]], [[free web hosting service]], or similar site, then please check the information on the external site thoroughly. Note that such sites should probably not be linked to if they contain information that is in violation of the creator's [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT|copyright]] (see [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT#Linking to copyrighted works|Linking to copyrighted works]]), or they are not written by a recognised, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]]. Linking to sites that you are involved with is also strongly discouraged (see [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]]).

If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to undo the bot's revert.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks! --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 00:50, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, please ignore this notice.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam1 --&gt;
