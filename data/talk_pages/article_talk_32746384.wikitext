Hi All,
      Hope all of you are fine.THis is just the beginning.I dont know what to write here.Infact this is my first article which I m going to publish,rather it be online or offline.I am amazed by myself that I have become a ''article-holic'' kind of person...ha ha.No keeping the jokes apart.Actually this is the strenght which I got due to my Love in my present Life .I always suppose to surprise her with new things as she is very desparate of most of the things which I do.She likes me and loves me very much.Whatever I do she feels very happy with that.But I remember the days when she actually got impressed by me.Those were the days which made her attracted towards me...You all must have been started haunting in your minds about the dyas which I mentioned here a few words before...........Ha ha.Dont get excited man I am here to discuss all these............You know what I really feel very excited to discuss those golden memories once again which I experienced during my starting phases of love...The girl whose raised my pulses...Seeing who my heart beats starts pumping in a faster pace............ufffff.&quot;How dare you?&quot;
                                                         No no no you are taking me wrong my dear readers.This was the first sentence which came out of her mouth when I gave her the proposal to kiss her......
