[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:GDibyendu|GDibyendu]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/119.56.125.92|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Thai Pongal]] because it didn't appear constructive. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:GDibyendu|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;  [[User:GDibyendu|GDibyendu]] ([[User talk:GDibyendu|talk]]) 08:34, 24 January 2013 (UTC)
