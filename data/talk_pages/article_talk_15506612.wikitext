Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guideline for biographies]].

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. &lt;font color=&quot;404040&quot;&gt;[[User:Skomorokh|скоморохъ]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skomorokh|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;ѧ&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:18, 30 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:Db-bio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt;
