[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;A tag has been placed on '''[[:User:Consultingajudge/Intraining Consulting]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of '''[[:User:Consultingajudge/Intraining Consulting]]''' and leave a note on '''[[Talk:User:Consultingajudge/Intraining Consulting|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Calton|Calton]] | [[User talk:Calton|Talk]] 14:39, 27 June 2009 (UTC)
