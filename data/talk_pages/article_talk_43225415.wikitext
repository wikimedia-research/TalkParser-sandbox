== Initial comment on [[Draft:Dublin University Ladies Boat Club]] ==

This is not your formal review, but just at a quick glance you really must fix the phrasing. &quot;We&quot;/&quot;our&quot; etc are completely inappropriate on an encyclopedia, as are subjective terms like &quot;beautiful&quot;. Bluntly, if you can put an exclamation point on any of your sentences, that sentence is probably wrong.

Your sourcing is a little iffy, you have a few mentions of news articles covering the controversy over this club as a gender/sports issue, which is great, but too much of the sourcing is to hobbyist sites and the like. Can you dig up a little more serious journalist/academic discussion of the club? If you live in Dublin, especially by the university, a library may have a copy of ''A danger to the men?: a history of women in Trinity College Dublin 1904-2004'', which appears to discuss this topic.

So please clean up the language for neutrality/impartiality, and a focus on dry facts vice fluff, and start digging further to see if you can find more serious professional discussion of this group. Good start, keep pressing. [[User:MatthewVanitas|MatthewVanitas]] ([[User talk:MatthewVanitas|talk]]) 17:25, 17 July 2014 (UTC)

::Similar problem with [[Draft:Commercial Rowing Club Dublin]], you ''really'' can't go around saying &quot;we&quot;. And you definitely need to focus on getting the full who-what-why-when-where into the first few sentences of any given article. See [[WP:Lead section]].

::That said, kudos for your work on improving our coverage of Rowing. WP does have a small [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Rowing]], though somewhat inactive currently, but it wouldn't hurt to go to the Discussion page of that project and introduce yourself and your work, just so you might run across some other enthusiasts. 

::Don't get discouraged, keep up the good work, and check in with the mentors at [[WP:Teahouse]] if you get stuck on anything. [[User:MatthewVanitas|MatthewVanitas]] ([[User talk:MatthewVanitas|talk]]) 17:33, 17 July 2014 (UTC)
