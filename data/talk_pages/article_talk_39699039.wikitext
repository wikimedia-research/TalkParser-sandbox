[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Yintan|Yintan]]. I wanted to let you know that I removed an external link you added&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Kristina Tuckute]] because it seemed inappropriate for an encyclopedia. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Yintan|my talk page]], or take a look at our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines]] about links. Thanks.
