'''Welcome!'''

Hello, {{#if:|{{{ipname}}},&amp;#32;}}and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/188.220.44.105|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages you might like to see:

You are welcome to continue editing without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but many editors recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles. For a full outline and explanation of the benefits that come with creating an account, please see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|this page]]. If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] (188.220.44.105) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your comments]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your IP address (or username if you're logged in) and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:XLinkBot|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page.

[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used as a platform for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion, and doing so is contrary to the goals of this project.

[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Lana Del Rey]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by an [[automated]] [[computer program]] called [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG makes very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|mistakes]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been considered as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|807628}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
*'''If you need help''', please see our '''[[Help:Contents|help pages]]''', and if you can't find what you are looking for there, please feel free to place &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on [[Special:MyTalk|your talk page]] and someone will drop by to help.
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Lana Del Rey]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lana+Del+Rey&amp;diff=470768819&amp;oldid=470719764 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/188.220.44.105|188.220.44.105]] [[User:188.220.44.105|(u)]] [[User talk:188.220.44.105|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.905564 on 2012-01-11T10:24:19+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 807628 --&gt;.

&quot;X dislikes Y&quot; does not indicate &quot;Y is not influenced by X&quot;, but I've attempted to use the reference you gave to indicate what's possibly known about Cobain's feelings on the matter (if you could find a more reliable source (e.g., a reporter, something written publicly by Cobain, etc), it would be greatly appreciated!).
