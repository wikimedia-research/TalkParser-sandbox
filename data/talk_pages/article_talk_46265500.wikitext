&lt;hr width=50%/&gt;This is nearly there, but there are a few things to clear up.
#It is '''reasonably well written'''.
#:a ''(prose, no copyvios, spelling and grammar)'': {{GAList/check|?}} b ''([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|MoS]] for [[WP:LEAD|lead]], [[WP:LAYOUT|layout]], [[WP:WTW|word choice]], [[WP:WAF|fiction]], and [[Wikipedia:Embedded list|lists]])'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: A few bits of prose read oddly, mainly in the first paragraph of &quot;History&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Yeovil and County Cricket Club were formed&quot; – here I believe you need the singular, as you're referring to a single entity, not a collection of individuals. The same later in the same sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;the club was reformed with the lesser remit&quot; – you mean &quot;re-formed&quot;, I think&lt;br/&gt;You use &quot;the club&quot; several times starting after &quot;The club played at West Hendford&quot; but you are referring to two different clubs. This is quite confusing.&lt;br/&gt;Pet peeve: &quot;from 17–19 August&quot; really ought to be &quot;from 17 to 19 August&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Final paragraph of &quot;History&quot;: &quot;The final first-class match was played on the ground&quot; should be &quot;The final first-class match on the ground was played&quot;.
#It is '''factually accurate''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]'''.
#:a ''([[WP:FNNR|reference section]])'': {{GAList/check|?}} b ''(citations to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]])'': {{GAList/check|y}} c ''([[Wikipedia:No original research|OR]])'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: Reference 26 is broken
#It is '''broad in its coverage'''.
#:a ''([[WP:Out of scope|major aspects]])'': {{GAList/check|y}} b ''([[WP:LENGTH|focused]])'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: 
#It follows the '''[[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy'''.
#:''Fair representation without bias'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: 
#It is '''stable'''.
#:''No edit wars, etc.'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: 
#It is illustrated by '''[[Wikipedia:Images|images]]''' and other media, where possible and appropriate.
#:a ''(images are tagged and non-free content have [[WP:FUR|fair use rationales]])'': {{GAList/check|y}} b ''([[WP:IMAGE RELEVANCE|appropriate use]] with [[WP:CAP|suitable captions]])'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: You're understandably a little uncertain about the non-free use rationale, but I think it's valid.
#'''Overall''': 
#:''Pass/Fail'': {{GAList/check|y}}
#:: &lt;s&gt;On hold for '''7 days''' to address the above issues. [[User:Relentlessly|Relentlessly]] ([[User talk:Relentlessly|talk]]) 07:11, 30 March 2015 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;&lt;!-- Template:GAList --&gt;
