==Untitled==
This is ridiculous- How can you name it &quot;Battle of Rajasthan&quot; when there is no record of anything as such happening anywhere

==Untitled 2==
Nicely researched and written article. However, this article should more aptly be called &quot;Arab-Rajput War&quot;. After all, since it was a long drawn conflict consisting of many battles, it should rightfully be called a war.

Secondly, the article does not mention a crucial reason because of which Pratihar power failed to completely dislodge the Arabs from India, who survived in a small pocket in Sindh for some more time. The reason was that Gurjar-Pratihars were jostling for supremacy in India with two other Indian powers, namely Lalitaditya in the north and Rashtrakuta in the South. That made the struggle between these powers a four cornered contest. While Lalitaditya was constantly engaged in warfare with Arabs, Rashtrakutas curiously had a policy of limited cooperation with the Arabs. Hence every time Pratihar Empire made any expedition against the Arabs in Sindh, it was followed by some incursion into Pratihar territory by the Rashtrakutas. The end result was that Pratihar effectiveness was blunted and its campaign to dislodge foreigners from Indian soil lost its momentum. This facet of the war needs to be given space in the article.

:Hi Sisodia,

:The [[Battle of Rajasthan]] was a momentous event in Indian History, similar to the [[Battle of Tours]] in Europe (732 CE). Even after the defeat at Tours the Arabs renewed their raids into France but the Battle of Tours is still considered a landmark event.

:The struggle against the Rashtrakutas and Palas should be part of the [[Pratihara]] page...the &quot;Arab-Rajput War&quot; can also be described there. But the Battle of Rajasthan shoud be treated separately since it was a landmark event.

I could not find this so called &quot;battle&quot; anywhere in any academic source I looked for. No historical record.

== Comments from uninvolved historians ==

''Copied from the recent [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Battle_of_Rajasthan|AfD]]''

*'''Weak keep, but needs serious revision'''. The nominator is being distinctly aggressive and the nomination is somewhat over-the-top, but it does make some good points. So far as I can make out, the battle is not ''entirely'' made up or a hoax - but the account currently given in the article looks as if it is closely based on some modern Indian sources who have been strongly selecting and interpreting historical sources to suit their ideological views. Earlier versions of the article had rather less of this problem but still seem to have been largely based on modern Indian sources with a similar (but possibly less dogmatic) viewpoint.
: Before going on, I note that while we do have a number of sources for the historical period and geographical area of this article, they are not ideal. All of them (whether Indian or Muslim) seem to be from at least a century (and sometimes much more) after the presumed battle and, while most mention fighting, they don't seem to give precise dates, times or opponents (at least in this particular period). So they do have to be treated with care.
: However, that has not been done in the article as it stands - in fact, it looks very much as if the sources used have been trying to build this up into an Indian equivalent of the Battle of Tours (and the Battle of Tours was pretty heavily hyped in many European chronicles). To take one definite error, [[List of caliphal governors of Sind]] lists Junaid as being dismissed in 726, which is (as it should be) in line with Arab sources (or at least within the variation of a year or two which one seems to get between Arab sources covering this period from a century or three later) which also (as some people have already pointed out above) make it clear that while he died sometime around 738, this happened in [[Khorasan]], not India. It is fairly clear from Arab sources such as [[al-Baladhuri]] (and from reliable secondary sources) that his successor Tammim died in post in some kind of disaster, probably sometime around 730, and was succeeded by Hakam al-Kalbi, who was still governor in 738 but apparently killed in 740.
: For greater detail, [https://archive.org/stream/ChronologicalDictionaryOfSindh#page/n273/mode/2up/search/738 this Chronological Dictionary of Sindh], published in Pakistan in the 1980s, while perhaps not fully reliable, seems to do a decent job of pulling together events from disparate sources into a slightly fuzzy timeline, which to me seems plausible and decently in agreement with the various sources. The picture we seem to get is one of  successful Arab attacks under Junaid about 725 and possibly under Hakam in the early 730s, but a major defeat of Tammam around 730 and defeats of the Arabs by Indian rulers in Rajputana and/or Gujurat in the years leading up to 740, followed by a native revolt, civil war between Arabs or both at once in Sindh. How many different Indian rulers defeated the Arabs and in what sorts of combinations is probably impossible to determine today, particularly as some of the accounts could well be a matter of rulers in later centuries wanting to prove that their ancestors had defeated the Arabs. What does seem almost certain is that we are not looking at an all-Indian coalition defeating the Arabs in a grand knockout battle - rather, we are looking at single rulers or local groups of rulers within Rajputana and Gujurat defeating the Arabs in one or more battles without names that have come down to us and with a few thousand troops on each side, perhaps similar to the actuality of Tours but quite a bit smaller than Talas (though note that numbers of troops, particularly enemy ones, given in medieval sources are usually exaggerated, often by a factor of ten or more). And, comparing with Tours, it also seems probable that it was the subsequent disorder in Sindh rather than the battles themselves that were directly responsible for stopping the Arab attacks.
: The name &quot;battle of Rajasthan&quot; is fairly obviously a relatively recent Indian invention - however, it does seem that other historians have started to use the name as a convenient label for the battles underlying the Indian nationalist account. Wikipedia should certainly have an article covering the Arab attacks on India during the decades after the conquest of Sindh, and under the circumstances, the current name seems somewhat acceptable though far from ideal. However, the article itself badly needs extensive reworking - my own inclination would be to start by reverting to a version from August 2012 or before, though that by itself will do little more than cut out the very worst of the current article. (As a final note - while I quite appreciate why [[User:Justice007]] has deleted large sections of the article, the '''Background''' and '''Later events''' sections, while unreferenced, were ironically rather less POV than most of the rest of the article.) [[User:PWilkinson|PWilkinson]] ([[User talk:PWilkinson|talk]]) 21:17, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

*'''Rename and repurpose''' (which is of course a variety of keep) -- We have a conflict of evidence (or of views - POV) with Hindu nationalists pushing one POV and (perhaps) their opponents pushing an opposing one.  What we need is NPOV, but in a heated atmosphere that is difficult to achieve.  At a relatively remote period (like this), the primary sources are probably chronicles, but they are also likely to present the POV of their side.  It is the job of the historian to sift the evidence from all sides and come up with a synthesis that fits all the evidence.  WP should present that synthesis; if there are multiple views, it ought to prsent them all and (ideally) weigh up their merits.  [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] tells us what he achieved, but says nothing about what happened afterwards, which is typical for a bio-article.  [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent#Arab invasion of Sindh]] gives some surrounding detail, but has a section that merely summarises the article with are discussing.  As I read the situation, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Indus valley, but the weakness of the Caliphate meant that it was unable to sustain his conquests, leading the to loss of the area east of the Indus.  '''The present name will not do''': the article relates (if anything) to a series of battles, not just one.  I Suspect that the creator wanted something structured so that he could put a &quot;battle infobox&quot; in it: that will not do for an article that (probably) concerns a whole war.  I was trying to get other contrinutors to do was not to argue over detail but to think about the matter structually.  Merging to [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]] would unbalance that article.  I am suggesting that we restructure the article as [[Arab invasion of Sindh]] or [[Arab invasion of Sindh and Rajasthan]], including also material from the two other articles mentioned; or that someone should create such an article.  This AFD discussion has led to otehr editors undertaking useful research, but I would be happier if we had a few references to primary sources or to academic books or articles synthesising them (secondary sources).  I would suggest that an Admin should close this as &quot;No consensus&quot;, leaving further work to be argued over on talk pages.  I would stress that I know nothing of the accuracy of the content of any of the articles and have taken them at face value, perhaps with some scepticism.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 10:47, 6 May 2015 (UTC)

::Well, Peterkingiron's suggestion of a renaming would be a start. Rajasthan didn't even exist back then and I can find very few mentions of &quot;battle of rajasthan&quot;, even less of which are reliable. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 09:50, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

::: My preference is to title it as &quot;Arab expeditions into India.&quot; Some of them succeeded and some didn't. We should cover all of them. &quot;Battle of Rajasthan&quot; is a proved folkloric term (which is why the Ram Jethmalani citation was there). So it could still be a redirect and mentioned somewhere in the lead as such. - [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 10:04, 9 May 2015 (UTC)
:::: I've no particular preference regarding what title would be better and am open to suggestions. I removed the [[:Ram Jethmalani]] [http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/the-defeat-and-retreat-of-hinduism thing] because he is a lawyer-turned-politician and I didn't realise it was intended as a cite for the folkloric bit. That said, a recent op-ed is evidence as much of potential neologism as folklore. I guess that if someone is in the camp that says the name is a part of the Hindutva revisionism etc then the fact that he was a BJP politician might encourage the notion. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 10:13, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

== Reorganizing the article based on tabular format ==

The Richards article I have linked above makes it clear that there was no single 'Battle of Rajasthan', but rather a serious raids and sieges, in which both Arabs and Indians were aggressors that continued for hundreds of years on the frontiers of first the Arab Caliphate and Indian kingdoms, and then between Islamicate Central Asian kingdoms and mainly Hindu South Asian kingdoms. As such, the inclusion of a table of such conflicts from the Richards source would be both informative and also lead nicely into the Muslim Conquests in the Indian Subcontinent article. Also, the fact that both Indians and Arabs were aggressors rules out a name of the kind 'Arab expedition into India' for this article. [[User:Fundamental metric tensor|I am invariant under co-ordinate transformations]] ([[User talk:Fundamental metric tensor|talk]]) 16:44, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

: Well, a table would be quite welcome, especially, since the sources are vague. But obviously the article can't be just a table! The problem with the title &quot;Battle of Rajasthan&quot; is that it is unbearable modern and folkloric. I tried hard to find out where it came from, but I couldn't. I don't find much wrong with the term &quot;Arab expedition&quot; because the &quot;Indians&quot; were just holding their ground and defending themselves. Your source says so on page 93: &quot;the ''defenders'' mounted successful raids in turn.&quot; Cheers, [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 19:14, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

: I'm with Kautilya3 on this, and I too am still trying to track down when ''Battle of Rajasthan'' emerged. FWIW, one problem with tables is that they tend to get messed up quite often, and especially when inexperienced contributors are involved. Given the nature of the article I would expect quite a lot of new contributors to have a play with it. I haven't checked the history to see whether that has been the case so far, though - I miss the analytical tools that we used to have before Labs took over and made a mess of things. We might get away with a list rather than a table, depending on the degree of detail you propose. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 21:06, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

:: Yes, I agree that ''BoR'' should not be the title of this page. However, the reference from Richards clearly lists battles with descriptions like &quot;Muslim principality becomes vassal of Pratiharas&quot; (845 CE, Yavana) and &quot;Kalachuri raids into Sindh to finance war with Pratihara kingdom&quot; (860 CE, Rajputana-Sind).

I am happy to use the neutral term &quot;conflicts&quot; if that is what the situation warrants. But I am not happy with broadening the scope from &quot;Arab-Rajput&quot; to &quot;Hindu-Muslim&quot;. That is what they call &quot;communalising&quot; history. The topic of this page is interesting because what we used to think of as little fragmented kingdoms somehow fought back a powerful empire, a world power. In the process, they might have established the border between Sindh and Gujarat + Rajasthan, which has held ever since. This is what is of interest to history, not Hindu-Muslim conflicts.

:: I am sympathetic to your argument here, was just following the notation in the source. Problem with &quot;Arab-Rajput&quot; is that not all commanders from the Central/West Asian side were Arabs, Turks became involved and later became the principal invading party. Also, we cannot be certain that all commanders from the South Asian side were Rajputs, do we know for example if the Shahis and the Chalukyas, Rashrtakutas were all Rajputs ?

::: First of all, thanks a lot for entering all this information. It is tremendously valuable to have it on Wikipedia.

I am sorry that {{U|Ghatus}} reverted it without discussion. But we can go back and look it up in the revision history.
::: In answer to your second question, no, Shahis, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas were not Rajputs. That is a good reason to omit them from here, except for passing mentions when necessary. Cheers, [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 17:45, 10 May 2015 (UTC)
:::: Or it is a good reason not to limit ourselves to Rajputs in the title etc, depending on how things pan out.

::::: Well, there is the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]] article, which has recently been enhanced for the Arab invasion period. This table could go there. As far as the &quot;Battle of Rajasthan&quot; goes, we should take the entries that deal with Rajasthan, Gujarat and Sindh, starting from 725 and ending in 810. This was the time period that was originally discussed in this article at the time of the AfD. I believe whoever wrote that mixed up [[Nagabhata I]] and [[Nagabhata II]], talking of it as a single &quot;battle.&quot; I think the 810 battle firmly established the Sindh-Rajasthan border, which has held ever since.

There is a paucity of historical sources. That is part of the reason why standard history books don't talk about this much. The Arab chronicles apparently don't mention their defeats. The Indian sources are just two, the &quot;Navsari grant&quot; and the &quot;Gwalior inscription,&quot; both documented now on the page. So, some not-so-great historians, Hindu nationalists and possibly Rajasthani folklore have filled in the gaps by their own reconstructions. See the Kamlesh Kapur book for an example. On the whole, these reconstructions are not far off the mark, because we can see the Sindh-Rajasthan border on the map and imagine what might have happened. But I don't believe ideas like &quot;Hindu alliance.&quot; I am going to the library today to get a couple of books. This is going to take a while.

== Use-mention mismatch in lead sentence ==

I appreciate that people here are trying to hedge the lead sentence properly to reflect the fact that the &quot;battle&quot; as such is not a historical fact, but the current version (&quot;The Battle of Rajasthan is a folkloric term...&quot;) is unsuitable. This is a [[use-mention distinction|use-mention mismatch]]. A term can refer to a battle, but a battle &quot;is&quot; not a term. A proper way of saying what people have apparently been trying to say here would be something like: 

{{tq|The term &quot;battle of Rajasthan&quot;, in popular Indian history-writing, refers to several battles…}}

Note, however, that the current footnote &quot;3&quot; is unsuitable to support either version of the lead sentence; this needs to be fixed. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 14:07, 10 May 2015 (UTC)

== Bhandarkar source ==

Central to this article are the two victories of Pulakesi and Nagabhata and these are based almost exclusively on the Bhandarkar source. Unfortunately, that source is not a reliable one. First, it is published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and is both borderline self-published as well as unlikely to have been peer reviewed. Second, the source itself is almost entirely conjecture. Bhandarkar has based his research on two inscriptions and missing information in Arab writing. The entire article is full of statements of the sort: ''The Arab account, no doubt, speaks of a force being Bent against Maliba ( Malwa ) and Uzain ( Ujjain ), but nowhere is it stated that they were reduced or subjugated. The Nau sari grant also does not say that Ujjain was seized or destroyed by the Tãjikas. We can therefore reasonably believe the Sägar Tãl inscription when it tells us that the army of the Baloch foreigners was defeated by Nãgabhata.'' This would be acceptable interpretation if it were validated by other sources. Since Bhandarkar wrote all this in 1929, we should be able to find, and should use those, more recent scholarly sources that support his interpretations. --[[User:RegentsPark|regentspark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:RegentsPark|comment]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 10 May 2015 (UTC)

== [[Arab conquest of Sindh]]? ==

How about converting this article into the main article on [[Arab conquest of Sindh]] , for which there are plenty of sources. Then the battles, raids, skirmishes with the rulers of Punjab, Rajasthan etc can be mentioned in one or two subsections. That way we won't have the tail wagging the dog, in which we try to create an article on a relatively minor, and poorly documented, event (ie, Battle of Rajasthan) and need to flesh it out with background material about a much more significant event (ie conqest of Sindh) on which wikipedia doesn't have a dedicated article. Note that ''The Arab Conqest of Sind'' is the first chapter of ''[[The Cambridge History of India]]'' (vol III), and while I am not suggesting using that dated source, it does establish the notability of that topic, which currently is covered in piecemeal fashion under [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] and [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]].

:Drat. I was sitting in the park and thinking the exact same thing :) My proposed title was [[Arab incursions in India]] or [[Eighth Century Arab incursions/invasions of India]].

The reason is, first of all, that I don't have the energy to research into the Sindh and Afghanistan and, secondly, because I suspect that there would be a lot more detail there because they were ''occupations'' rather than incursions.

:::::::: The historical India includes all of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (though not Afghanistan). Therefore, incursions into Sindh are incursions into India and Arab conquest of Sindh is also an Arab conquest in India. I'm not fussy about the title. Rather, we have to be careful that we don't take material out of context and avoid writing our own theses on the importance of these battles. And we have to make big claims carefully. For example, the legacy section implies that both the decimal number system as well as Algebra were disseminated from India to the Arab world as a result of these battles. That may indeed be the case but perhaps it would be better to make these claims in our articles on [[Algebra]] or [[Decimal]] or [[History of Algebra]] where the sources can be better evaluated  before we make such large claims on what is, at best, an article of peripheral historical interest. --[[User:RegentsPark|regentspark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:RegentsPark|comment]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:12, 15 May 2015 (UTC)

== Timelines ==

There are major confusions with timelines. There were at least two major Arab expeditions, possibly three, as shown in the map called &quot;Arab campaigns.&quot; The old Indian sources weren't good at keeping track of them, a problem inherited by Richards's table. For instance, Richards puts Junayd everywhere, whereas he was transferred out in 726. But the Arab side of the history is well-documented now and Blankinship has a good description of them. So, I am working on straightening out the timelines. Unfortunately, the Indian sources don't have good dates. - [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 09:04, 15 May 2015 (UTC)

Sorry, folks. I am afraid I did a bit of synthesis. It seemed obvious to me that the Brahmagupta books must have been obtained from Bhinmal if they went to Baghdad soon after its annexation. I didn't read it anywhere that the books went from Bhinmal. The astronomer that went with the books was called &quot;Kanaka al-Hind&quot; and I have been interpreting al-Hind to mean the lands east of Indus.

::::{{ping|AshLin}} what you were writing was good stuff, just not really taking us anywhere useful in the context of this article. I am sure it is useful elsewhere, which I think is pretty much what Abecedare is saying also. Kautilya3 is correct re: the many small kingdoms etc but the fact remains that we cannot synthesise: if the sources don't say much about the Battle of Rajasthan then we cannot and should not say much about it. This is especially so if the sources do not even use the term and - sorry to bang on about this - I'm pretty sure that few do because it seems to be a recently-coined term favoured by pro-Hindu nationalists and their like. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 16:20, 16 May 2015 (UTC)

When I went to school, I was taught that [[Ambhi]], the ruler of Taxila, who acceded to [[Alexander the Great]], was a &quot;traitor.&quot; Supposedly Alexander treated him as such and cut him down to size. But, only after learning enough history that I realized that Taxila was actually a part of the Achaemenid empire at that time. It was a border town that made its money through trade between India and Persia, and maintained friendly relations with both. [[Kautilya]], my famous namesake, decided that Taxila should become part of &quot;India&quot; and made sure that it did. But the reality is that what we now call &quot;Pakistan&quot; has always been a bridge between South Asia and West Asia. It could move between the two spheres of influence as dictated by history. The Arab conquest of the 8th century moved it west. Our friend on [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]] just changed &quot;Umayyad invasion of Sindh&quot; to &quot;Umayyad expansion&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muslim_conquests_on_the_Indian_subcontinent&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=662545171] and nobody complained. But, on this page, they definitely &quot;invaded.&quot; I think those who argue for an unchanging idea of &quot;India&quot; are ignoring historical realities and buying into the [[Akhand Bharat|Hindutva idea of India]]. So my answer, once again, is no. This page is about the Arab incursions into &quot;India,&quot; not the Indian subcontinent.

{{reply|Kautilya3}} But that's not how the secondary source discuss the subject. All the sources I have seen (Wink, Bhandarkar, Haig) (briefly) discuss the events discussed in this article in context of the Arabic conquest of Sindh, so I don't think we need to draw this artificial division between (seventh century) India and the Indian subcontinent. Best practice would be to use non-anachronistic names such as Sindh, Gurjara country, Malwa etc with reference to modern day &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Rajasthan&quot; &quot;Gujarat&quot; etc. made only to orient the reader. &lt;/br&gt;
{{reply|AshLin}} To answer your question about the proposed broader article, see the above section on [[Talk:Battle of Rajasthan#Arab conquest of Sindh?|Arab conquest of Sindh?]]. Basically the idea is to
# Rename the article. All the better quality sources I have seen label the events raids, and sometimes invasions (so far only Blankinship). As discussed previously &quot;Battle of Rajasthan&quot; appears to be a neologism used by isolated, poorer quality, sources.
#''Expand'' the current [[Battle of Rajasthan#Background|Background]] and [[Battle of Rajasthan#Campaign by Muhammad bin Qasim|Campaign by Muhammad bin Qasim]] sections to be the central focus with the raids/invasion of Rajasthan and Northwest India (which is currently missing from the article) forming a section. This would match ''all'' the sources that I have seen on the subject. Has anyone come across any exception?

:: The Richards source mentions large Arab expeditions and sieges. Other good sources mention large amphibious expeditions. The raids were mainly to raise resources for the bigger conflicts (in this theatre and elsewhere). For example, the Kalachuris later raided Sindh under Arab rule to finance their war with the Pratiharas.

{{reply|Abecedare}} History can be written from various points of view, in this case the Muslim/Islam point of view (Wink, Bhandarkar), Arab point of view (Blankinship), Ancient Indian/Hindu point of view (Sen etc.), Rajasthan point of view, etc. No particular viewpoint is ''a priori'' more legitimate than another. Obviously, we don't want to create multiple articles on the same subject from different points of view. So, all such viewpoints should be combined and integrated. It is not helpful to say one source does this. So should we.

The subject of this article, as originally conceived, rightly belongs in Rajasthan history, keeping in mind that Rajasthan and Gujarat seem to be an integrated whole at this point. They bordered Sindh and somehow magically they stood up to the Arabs. Their story needs to be told, despite the fact that it is very difficult to piece it together. This doesn't preclude other articles coming into being such as [[Arab invasion of Sindh]] or [[Arab incursions into Indian subcontinent]] etc. Once the content for this article is developed, it can be summarised wherever it is needed.

:Kautilya3, based on what you're saying here and in the big picture section below, you're treading heavily into the OR territory. Perhaps all this is true but it is not for us to create the 'Big Picture' or to piece together difficult stories. Both are left to historians publishing in peer reviewed journals where their conclusions can be examined and the legitimacy of those conclusions validated.  Nor is it correct that no particular viewpoint is more legitimate than others - there are always more legitimate viewpoints and less legitimate ones and the relative merits of one versus the other is decided by looking at the weight scholars give to each viewpoint. I'm sorry to say this, but it seems as if you're writing a research paper (without having to face the scrutiny of a peer review) rather than an encyclopedic article. --[[User:RegentsPark|regentspark]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:RegentsPark|comment]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:21, 18 May 2015 (UTC)
::Agree with RegentsPark. Kautilya3, this is not the first time that the problem has been highlighted but you are persisting in this exercise.

::: {{reply|Kautilya3}} I have to agree with RP that that sounds like a suggestion to play amateur-historian and synthesize a history (or, view of history) that no historian has formulated before, and an approach contrary to the best available sources. Besides being disallowed by wiki-policies, it is also a dangerous  and foolhardy conceit since it tends to introduce errors as previously in the ''Legacy'' section, or more subtle ones. 
:::An example of the latter: currently the article says, {{tq|The booty from Junayd's campaigns in India is estimated to have been 400 million dirhams and 650,000 captives. In comparison, Iraq's annual tax was 120 million dirhams.}} which substitutes &quot;India&quot; for &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0Yy053WS4C&amp;pg=FA65&amp; '''deep''' into India]&quot; (Blankinship consistently considers Sind part of India; see map [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0Yy053WS4C&amp;pg=FA65&amp; on page 244] for example) and, more importantly, leaves out the 600 million dirhams that the Sind campaign yielded.

:::: Ok, I got the message. Will be more careful. I will take out the booty paragraph too. I never liked it anyway.
:::: On another matter, the table of conflicts from Richards is badly broken because it puts Junayd all over the place whereas we know he was relieved in 726. Also, the presence of Nagabhata I in 725 is doubtful because reliable sources believe he started in 730 at the earliest. So on.

I am retaining the &quot;Commanders&quot; column in the table for now, hoping that {{U|Ghatus}} can check the sources once he is back online. The date of 743 for the annexation of Bhinmal worries me because, according to Blankinship, Hakam died in 740 and there were no land incursions afterwards.

== The term Hindu ==

In the table from Richards, we use the source to qualify the term 'Hindu' and avoid any communal associations. However, we dont do this before that in the bulk of the article. If we are using the term 'Arab' in the rest of the article, I think 'Indian' would be a better term to use in the article. The term 'Arab' carries almost all the same caveats as the term 'Indian', the multiplicity of meanings, the association with a modern day nationalism and socio-political conflicts. No to mention the word 'Hindu' in older sources is usually meant in the sense of 'Indian' or 'South Asian' today. [[User:Fundamental metric tensor|I am invariant under co-ordinate transformations]] ([[User talk:Fundamental metric tensor|talk]]) 16:53, 17 May 2015 (UTC)

:: Hi Fundamental metric tensor, I just realized that I kept the &quot;Hindu&quot; term around earlier because of your comment and footnote about Hindu/Muslim terminology. You may need to do this replacement in the full table too, because, several Indian (Sindhi/Afghan) Muslims are labelled as &quot;Hindu&quot; too, which looks bad.

== Regarding big picture ==

It is certainly a good idea to tie the contents of this article to a broader view. The sources do seem to indicate that this eastern frontier was peripheral to the Arab caliphate, which seems plausible since they faced more serious threats from the Byzantines and internal Arab-non Arab conflicts. However, a couple of the newer Indian sources (Sen, Saxena etc) indicate that the outcomes of these battles might have had a role to play in the establishment of the Habbari dynasty and Soomra dynasties in Sindh later. If we can find good sources that make this connection that would be a worthy addition to this article. [[User:Fundamental metric tensor|I am invariant under co-ordinate transformations]] ([[User talk:Fundamental metric tensor|talk]]) 18:11, 18 May 2015 (UTC)

: It seems that the sea trade was their main concern. Blankship or Wink has said that the Arabs &quot;turned their back&quot; on the mediterranean and grew to depend on the Indian Ocean trade. Protecting the trade is what brought them to Sindh and that is probably what drove them towards South India, which turned into a disaster. But, meanwhile, there was plenty of unforced jehadism too, which got them nowhere. Cheers, [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 16:44, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

== The content is done ==

I am essentially done with the content of the article. The lead, the title and the infobox remain. In the end, there is no mystery here. The Arabs overreached, got defeated by the Chalukyas and that weakened them enough so that the smaller upstart kingdoms pushed them out. Please feel free to copy edit, or quiz me about any details. The Aftermath section needs citations. I will put them in after I go back and read the sources once more. Cheers, [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 16:41, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

===Arabs East of Indus===
Arabs retained control of Al Mansura, which is situated East of Indus and was the capital of Arab Sindh. So it is unlikely they lost control of areas east of Indus following the defeat of 739. The loss of control probably refers to the period when Tamim was forced to ababdon the province and flee across the river before drowning.[[Special:Contributions/202.79.203.83|202.79.203.83]] ([[User talk:202.79.203.83|talk]]) 03:48, 21 May 2015 (UTC)

== Kashmir ==

{{ping|Fundamental metric tensor}}, Regarding Kashmir [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Rajasthan&amp;diff=663357892&amp;oldid=663277105 diff], here is what Blankship states during the al-Junayd and al-Hakam periods:
* p.132: Perhaps the first of al-Junayd's efforts was that directed to the north against al-Kiraj, possibly to be identified with Kira or the Kangra Valley near Dharmsala in the present-day Himachal Pradesh.[78] This area, along with Kashmir, had previously been raided by Muhammad b. al-Qasim[79] and 'Amr b. Muslim al-Bahili.[80] As no campaigns against places between al-Kiraj and Sind are mentioned by the sources, it must be assumed that these territories, including much of the great plain of Punjab, were regularly a part of Sind and therefore presented no obstacle to al-Junayd's progress. In alliance with the rising kingdom of Kashmir, al-Junayd took the capital of al-Kiraj  by storm. This seems to have effectively put an end to the kingdom of al-Kiraj.[81]
* p.188 To the north, al-Hakam may have sent an expedition against Kanauj and Kashmir, for in 118/736 these appealed to the Chinese emperor for help.[127] But the threat against Kanauj and Kashmir also may have come from the Tibetans, so that the evidence for al-Hakam's activity in this quarter is slight.
So, apparently Kashmir ''allied'' with the Arabs during Junayd's time, rather than fighting them. I can also show you the footnotes, which give copious analysis of how Blankinship arrived at these conclusions. Regarding what happened in Hakam's time, it is confirmed that Kashmir tried to ally with the Chinese, but there is no record of Hakam going back to even ''al-Kiraj''. I think Hasan (1959) is too weak a source to counter this. Cheers, [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 07:39, 21 May 2015 (UTC)

{{ping|maglorbd}}, Do you have any better information about this issue? - [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 08:13, 21 May 2015 (UTC)

: I think Blankinship had trouble with dates here. The footnote [81] says: ''Al-Junayd was accompanied by Chandrapida, the king of Kashmir (reigned at least 94-106/713-24), and his forces. Baladhuri, Futuh, 541; Ya'qubi, Ta'rikh, II, 379-80; Ibn al-Athir, Kamil, IV, 590, V, 135; Majumdar, III, 132-33, 173, IV, 244; Tripathi, 196; Vaidya, I, 236, 240.'' However, Chandrapida didn't reign till 724. Sailendra Nath Sen says he was murdered after 9 years. Lalitaditya started his reign either in &lt;s&gt;720&lt;/s&gt; 723 (Wink I, p.242) or in 724 (Sen, p. 294). So, Chandrapida's alliance that Blankinship is talking about must have taken place in Bin Qasim's regime, not Junayd's.
: But the fact remains that we don't have corroboration from Blankinship or Wink for an Al-Junayd attack on Kashmir. - [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 17:36, 21 May 2015 (UTC)

:: That is the problem with the sources, they differ. Blankingship explained how he arrived at his conclusion, the other sources are not as forthcoming in that regard. Most agree Lalityaditya ruled 724 - 760 AD, and he repelled the Arabs. Who the Arab governor was it not often Mentioned. &quot;Arab Invasion of India&quot; by R.

However, [[Vatsaraja]], Nagabhata's grand-nephew is known to have been a ruler in Ujjain.
