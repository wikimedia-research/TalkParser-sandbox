Is &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot; the name of the individual or a group ? An individual can't have a line-up, surely ? -- [[User:Beardo|Beardo]] ([[User talk:Beardo|talk]]) 06:43, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

:I think it's a group, but the article is ambiguous. I'm going to try to get to the bottom of this in time and update the article accordingly. -[[User:FrankTobia|FrankTobia]] ([[User talk:FrankTobia|talk]]) 16:56, 19 June 2008 (UTC)


It's the stage name of the individual singer. Also, bits of this article are copied DIRECTLY from the linked NY Times article, with no reference or notification.  This should be fixed, preferably by someone who can remember their logins.. ~~  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.115.6.86|70.115.6.86]] ([[User talk:70.115.6.86|talk]]) 19:13, 13 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== How does this sentence make sense? ==

&quot;While she was being trailed by a writer and photographer she developed condylar resorption.&quot;  This sounds as if the being trailed by a writer and/or photographer could (or might) have caused the condylar resorption, when in reality the condition is idiopathic.  This sentence needs to be recast. [[Special:Contributions/99.93.246.124|99.93.246.124]] ([[User talk:99.93.246.124|talk]]) 03:14, 9 February 2011 (UTC)
