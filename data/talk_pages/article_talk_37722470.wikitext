==Including Music==
Hi Francis, it was nice to meet you yesterday. [[Tonality]] is an article you might want to look at, it has a snippet of music. If you can load files to commons as .png files then the code &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:your image file.png|thumb|Caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is worth copying. the thumb is for thumbnail and you can also position by adding |left |right or if you are OK with American English, |center. So &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|Caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as [[Image:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|Caption]]

Also you might want to join [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Music]] I'm sure there are people there who are very familiar with ways to display sheet music.

:Hi Francis! Glad to see you yesterday.
:You were asking about PDFs, I believe? We do support PDFs, though not always perfectly; they can be included as standard image links, with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:your file.pdf|thumb|Caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will always display the ''first'' page of a multi-page file; to get it to display an arbitrarily selected page, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:your file.pdf|thumb|Caption|page=42]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:We don't currently have a system which lets us embed or edit musical notation in articles other than as images, but it's a long-standing feature request and there has apparently been some movement on it in the past couple of months. It'd make this work a lot easier! [[User:Andrew Gray|Andrew Gray]] ([[User talk:Andrew Gray|talk]]) 15:07, 24 November 2012 (UTC)
