== Shina and kashmiri languages ==

It is absolutely wrong that there is no connection between languages spoken in Kashmir valley and Gilgit/Chilas region. In fact Kashmiri also called Kausher is a sister language of Shina. Both languages share upto 30% common everyday vocabulary. Shina and kashmiri/kausher together with swat kohistani language belong to Eastern subgroup of Dardic languages.  Shins and kashmiris do originate from the same linguistic ancestors, this is proven with presence of shina speaking people in Gurez region within kashmir valley, some ethnic kausher/kashmiri tribes like &quot;Lone&quot; tribe in northern kashmir are often billingual in both kashmiri/kausher and Shina, the reason is quite simple Shins and Kausher/kashmiris are from the same roots.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/129.69.21.94|129.69.21.94]] ([[User talk:129.69.21.94|talk]]) 12:29, 20 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Pakistan, Kashmir ==

Considering Northern Areas as part of pakistan occupied Kashmir is questionable as the area was first liberated by the people of the area themselves and volunterily joined Pakistan.

The above statement is untrue. The British decided to make it a bone of contention and one Major Brown of the British army without authority raised the Pakistani flag in the area just before the withdrawal of the british army.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/196.1.52.48|196.1.52.48]] ([[User talk:196.1.52.48|talk]]) 04:07, 14 November 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:It is the Indian Viewpoint and IMHO must be presented here for the sake of NPOV. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 21:38, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Azad Kashmir / Pakistan-occupied Kashmir ==

India certainly does not refer to the Northern Areas as Azad Kashmir since that term means 'Free Kashmir' and would imply that India was occupying the rest of Kashmir (an implication that is obviously against the Indian government's policy). The usual term used by the Indian government and the media is PoK or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to refer to all of Kashmir under Pakistani rule. That part of the article which incorrectly states that India uses the term 'Azad Kashmir' should be changed.

The whole article has a pro pakistan slant. It speaks of the UN resolution on plebiscite. But does not speak of teh pre-condition that Pakistan must withdraw from the Pakistan occuppied areas. It also does not mention the fact that now plebiscite is an impossiblity because teh areas have been extensively occuppied by Pakistanis from other areas making the Pakistanis a minority whereas India did not do that.
It speaks of &quot;annexation&quot; etc. again rather slanted.
:That thing was due to an [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{PAGENAME}}|diff=5162684&amp;oldid=4792794}} apparently unintended edit]. This was cleaned up by [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{PAGENAME}}|diff=6298221&amp;oldid=6296141}} this edit], but to maintain NPOV IMHO (see my previous comment above), I added back the statement that India calls it a part of PoK. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:47, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== NPOV Section - History ==

The following description presents only the pro-Pakistani point of view. --[[User:DuKot|DuKot]] 21:27, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

''But the people of Gilgit-Baltistan regard themselves as being distinct from Kashmiris and many want to become the fifth province of Pakistan. And they oppose being included in Kashmir. Their opinion is that invasion of Mahrajas doesn't mean that this is a part of Kashmir, just like British invasion over the India in 19th century does not mean that India is a part of Britain.''


:Actually, the view is that of the people there.  The Pakistani govt. doesn't want to extend make them a province because they believe that would make the Indians believe that they have agreed to a defacto permanent border.  What do you propose be said instead then?  The people there go up within Pakistan and often work in Pakistani cities in other provinces as well.  You might as well call the views of someone in Karachi pro-Pakistani as that's all you'll hear.  [[User:Tombseye|Tombseye]] 23:14, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed merger ==

{{discussion-top}}
I oppose the proposed merger between this article and Gilgit Agency, because the Agency was an entity which existed until the 1970's and the Northern Areas were created by merging the Agency with Hunza and Nagar principalities. [[User:Green Giant|Green Giant]] 22:15, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
:Right, I see your point. You're right, the article has been refined, but it wasn't clear enough on the [[Gilgit Agency]] page that the [[Gilgit Agency]] is now a part of [[Northern Areas]], there is no sentence on this page that refers to the article [[Northern Areas]]. (Although it's mentioned on the [[Northern Areas]] page.) 

:Otherwise, you're right, the two articles stand on their own. How about adding a conspicuous sentence on top of the [[Gilgit Agency]] article? I would say that the [[Northern Areas]] page is just fine the way it is.

:And I saw a couple of articles referring to [[Gilgit Agency]], and not to [[Northern Areas]], in a way that created more confusion. Also, the [[Gilgit]] article refers not to Gilgit city, but &quot;Gilgit region&quot;, not specifying whether it's about the district, or Gilgit agency... It also states, &quot;Gilgit has an area of 14,680 mi² (38,021 km²).&quot;, it is not specified whether it's the area of district or Gilgit Agency. It needs refinement as well. [[User:Waqas.usman|Waqas.usman]] 00:38, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

I '''Strongly Oppose''' the merger. They are different and should exist in two separate articles. --[[User:Spasage|Spasage]] 07:39, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

== Northern Areas Districts - Overlay in Google Earth ==

For identifying towns, villages, peaks, lakes etc by districts, use the following placemarks alongwith the overlay map for district boundaries of Northern Areas:
[http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/420123/an/0/page/0#420123 Northern Pakistan detailed placemarks in Google Earth]

Open the above mentioned overlay map in Google Earth and it clearly shows what lies in which district (but this map is old, Astore district was carved out of Diamer District later on in 2004, works for all other boundaries).

== Article is becoming increasingly one-sided ==

This page needs to be checked for its neutrality as the article is increasignyl becoming one-sided. Idleguy in particular seems to be adding alot of this. All of the sources added are from [[India|Indian]] sources, and i know that the countries of Pakistan and India have a bitter enemity, so I can see why sources from one country would be derogatory towards the other. So, hence, I request using neutral sources
For example, there is use of double-sources. The person added that The Hindu(an indian source) wuoted a Pakistani source The Dawn.
&quot;Though outwardly calm, the Northern Areas of Pakistan are simmering with a crisis that has all the ingredients of boiling over the rim&quot;
But I did a search on google, with the quote and it came up with nothing. I then emaied Dawn (www.dawn.com), and they said their records do not show anything with those quotes.

ALSO, I think Poltical substance of the Indian-Pakistan conflict should be kept out of this, and perhaps be put in the Kashmir article in wikipedia. I can sense that this is becomign a propaganda war.
--[[User:Cranberryjuice10|Cranberryjuice10]] 19:40, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

: &quot;The Herald&quot; is a Pakistani publication. have you even read that? First you disputed its contents trying to sound rude in my talk page then when it was provided, you simply tag it as POV. True, rediff is an Indian website but The Hindu used a double source. I've emailed them myself to check which date they got the selected quote. Until I get that I can't comment on it. [[User:Idleguy|Idleguy]] 01:47, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

:Now I've added half a dozen sources - mainly Pakistani and an international one - and all of them still talk about the fact that there is violence and discontent in NA due to the lack of legal and political representation. I hope you read the sources before levelling allegations at me as if I'm making up things. --[[User:Idleguy|Idleguy]] 02:25, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

If the page on [[Jammu and Kashmir]] doesn't say in the intro that Jammu and Kashmir is disputed between Pakistan and India, then this page shouldnt' say that Northern Areas of Pakistan is disputed between Pakistan and India.

== Be reasonable ==

Hi all, can you guys please take a deep breath and count backwards from 20 to 1? I think that will considerably help you in reducing your hatred towards each other. There's a guy, using BT connection from somewhere in the UK, who accuses me of being pro-Indian. My dear friend, (the IP editor, and pls don't think that Paki is a deregatory term as used in the UK. It merely means a person with a Pakistani origin in India), I am no blind Indian. But the kind of abuse that you and your fellow editors heap on others, will definitely force any self respecting Indian to become a staunch supporter of all her policies. This was exactly the case even with the Germans during Hitler's reign.

In line with naming conventions applied to other Pakistani provinces, e.g. [[North-West Frontier Province]] (and equally [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]), I propose that this article's title should be '''''Federally Administered Northern Areas''''' (presently a redirect to ''Northern Areas (Kashmir)''). Apart from the reason already provided (i.e. consistency), I would add two more:
# It would make the generally applied abbreviation ''FANA'' more easily understood.
# I find the current title somewhat oblique with the parenthesis ''(Kashmir)'' more obfuscating than helpful. Since this is part of a contested area, the title should be as neutral, descriptive and unambiguous as possible, even at the cost of being lengthy and officious sounding.

== Bias ==

&quot;The people of this remote region were liberated from the Dogra regime of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir on 1 November 1947 with the help of the Pakistani army and then became citizens of a self-liberated and very short-lived independent state (17 days only). The new state asked the government of Pakistan to provide it with necessary assistance with which to conduct its affairs, as it did not have the necessary administrative infrastructure of its own. The government of Pakistan accepted the request and sent Sardar Muhammad Alam Khan, an extra assistant commissioner from the NWFP, to Gilgit. Sardar Muhammad Alam Khan then took control of the territory's administration as its first appointed political agent.&quot; - The single source is a pakistani newspaper and it cannot be accepted as a neutral source.

== Kashmiriness ==

A sentence in the lead read, &lt;code&gt;Gilgit-Baltistan and the neighboring Azad Kashmir together constitute the disputed region, referred to as [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] by the [[United Nations]][http://ochaonline.un.org/humanitarianappeal/webpage.asp?Page=1893] and other international organisations, and as ''Pakistan-occupied Kashmir'' in India.[http://www.sify.com/news/china-has-major-presence-in-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-gilgit-activist-news-international-kjcnubijjdc.html]&lt;/code&gt; 

However, when the UN source[http://ochaonline.un.org/humanitarianappeal/webpage.asp?Page=1893] mentions Gilgit-Baltistan, it treats it as ''separate'' from &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot;, which is used synonymously with [[Azad Kashmir]]. Here are the relevant excerpts: &lt;code&gt;Baluchistan, '''Pakistan-Administered Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan''', also experienced extreme weather, resulting in widespread losses and damages.... up to seven different geographical areas (Baluchistan, Punjab, Federally Administered Tribal Area, '''Gilgit Baltistan''', KPK, '''Pakistan-Administered Kashmir''', Sindh... Baluchistan / Federally Administered Tribal Areas / '''Gilgit-Baltistan''' / Khyber Pakthunkhwa / '''Pakistan-Administered Kashmir''' / Punjab / Sindh&lt;/code&gt;

Interestingly, the Indian source[http://www.sify.com/news/china-has-major-presence-in-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-gilgit-activist-news-international-kjcnubijjdc.html] uses &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot; to refer to the area administered by Pakistan and claimed by India as part of &quot;Kashmir&quot;. (The definition used by the Indian source includes Gilgit Baltistan, although neither the Gilgit-Baltistanis nor the Pakistanis always accept this definition). The only instance of &quot;occupied Kashmir&quot; is in the title, suggesting to me a [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2008/07/christian_sites_ban_on_g_word.html Tyson Homosexual]-type automatic replacement.

This usage by both sources belies the claim that &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot; is a neutral or international description, at least when it includes Gilgit-Baltistan as well as Azad Kashmir, because it uncritically accepts the Indian government's extremely expansive definition of &quot;Kashmir&quot;. So I've changed the lead to indicate that the Indian government claims the place as part of its [[Jammu and Kashmir]], without getting into the muddy waters of how &quot;Kashmiri&quot; this place is, because that question requires better sources in a dedicated article.

:I followed you up until the third paragraph where you state:

::''&quot;Interestingly, the Indian source uses &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot; to refer to the area claimed by all of India as &quot;Kashmir&quot; (which includes Gilgit Baltistan...)&quot;''.

:What do you mean by &quot;the area claimed by all of India as 'Kashmir'&quot;? It sounds as if you are saying that India refers to all of what they consider to be &quot;Kashmir&quot; as &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot;. The source you linked doesn't seem to directly address this claim. It does state:

::''&quot;...India's claims of the province (Gilgit-Baltistan), which Senger says is 'constitutionally part of J&amp;K (Jammu and Kashmir), and under Pakistan's illegal occupation since 1947'.&quot;'', which is consistent with my understanding of India's position.

:::The government may use &quot;occupied&quot; exclusively, but non-government pro-India sources, such as the quoted Indian news agency, may use &quot;administered&quot;. For both such Indian-biased sources, &quot;Pakistan administered/occupied Kashmir&quot; includes Gilgit Baltistan, while for Pakistan, the United Nations and other international sources, &quot;Pakistan administered Kashmir&quot; does not necessarily include Gilgit Baltistan. My concern is that some articles on Wikipedia juxtapose the term &quot;Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot; against &quot;Pakistan-occupied Kashmir&quot;, using both to describe India's claims and promoting the former as a neutral/international term for Azad Kashmir-plus-Gilgit Baltistan, when the latter's inclusion within &quot;Kashmir&quot; is a contention directly connected to India's claims (which don't respect Pakistan's administrative separations since 1947).

:: Sure...this has been discussed many times before, so in case you are not familiar with the topic, I can clarify. [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] is not the only disputed territory, the entire [[Kashmir]] region is disputed. The region consists of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], which are part of Pakistan, and the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which is administered by India. All articles have just about a sentence in their leads and the same standards apply here. There is no reason at all why a paragraph of the [[Kashmir conflict]] should be discussed in depth in this particular article.

On 22 October 1947 the Pakistani armed forces crossed the border in Jammu and Kashmir with the claim that they needed to suppress a rebellion on the southeast of the kingdom. Local tribal militias and the Pakistani forces moved to take [[Srinagar]] but on reaching [[Uri, Jammu and Kashmir|Uri]] they encountered defensive forces. Hari Sing made a plea to India for assistance and signed the [[Instrument of Accession]].

*'''Include''' It is accurate historical fact. The article fails NPOV without any mention of this. [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 13:03, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Meh'''. Before this or anything else can be added to the article, first the existing stuff in the article has to be cleaned up. This was surely one of the most chaotically structured history sections I've ever seen. Then we need to find a place ''where'' to insert any new stuff. CMD was absolutely right in saying that the way you thew it in was extremely poor editorship. When stuff has been cleaned up, we can add a paragraph or two about what happened in 1947. In doing so, it will be important to keep in mind that detail articles should not needlessly duplicate the content of their parent articles. The general history of how and why India and Pakistan came into conflict and why parts of Kashmir came under the control of either party is a matter for [[Kashmir conflict]] and other higher-level articles. Here, these general events do not need to be summarized with more than one sentence. In that sense, I don't see why we need &quot;crossed the border in Jammu and Kashmir with the claim that they needed to suppress a rebellion&quot; or &quot;the UN passed a resolution...&quot; etc. here. What this article needs is only what's really specific to this one geographical portion of the area, and that doesn't seem to be overly much. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 13:14, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''No''', already discussed above. Only a neutral summary of the conflict should be added ''after'' being proposed here, with the main article link to [[Kashmir conflict]].

::How is it not neutral? [[User:Darkness Shines|Darkness Shines]] ([[User talk:Darkness Shines|talk]]) 14:02, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
::TopGun, can you propose an alternative?  I find this to be a step in the right direction at a minimum.  Pakistan is in the region, the UN called for forces to withdraw, they are still there.  These are verifiable facts.  That being said, I don't know enough about this region to know for certain that it is neutral.  The UN resolution was in 1948.  Is that still the stance of the UN?  Has the UN's stance changed?  The fact of the matter is, the disputed status of this region should be mentioned in ''all three articles''.  There seems to be no opposition to that fact.  Instead of debating the inclusion of this, editors should be collaborating to create a working neutral piece of information for each of the three articles.  Adding this information in just the article on Gilgit-Baltistan does in fact go against any consensus in the preceding RfC.  I know very little about the politics of India and Pakistan, so I apologize that I cannot assist more with the content creation of these facts.  I do know enough to understand that none of these articles adequately covers the disputed status of this region.  Just as an article on Taiwan cannot be written without reference to its disputed status, these should be written with that reference.&amp;nbsp;[[User:Ryan Vesey|'''''Ryan''''']]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Ryan Vesey|'''''Vesey''''']] 14:13, 30 July 2012 (UTC)

::::: Ryan, I still think we should concentrate material on the highest-level articles possible. It is a bit of a pity there doesn't currently seem to be a common top-level article for all Pakistan-administered parts of the Kashmir area together – if there was, that would clearly be the place for this stuff – but there's [[Kashmir conflict]] and multiple subarticles to that. Gilgit-Baltistan is only one part of a larger issue. If we have an article about an entity that is affected by or part of some larger situation, we don't re-hash all our coverage of the larger situation in each sub-article. We ''mention'' it, of course, and we link to it, but we don't expect ''treatment'' of it. In an article about some city that was destroyed in WWII, we ''mention'' the war in that article (obviously), but we don't rehash the whole story of why WWII started and how it ended. In an article about some settlement in the West Bank, we ''mention'' that the area is disputed, but we don't rehash the whole story of the Palestinian conflict in each. What really is important in this article here is not the story of how the India-Pakistan war started, or what this or that international body thinks about its outcome. Those are facts about the larger situation, to which we need to only give a pointer. What really matters here is, for instance, the story of what consequences the conflict has on the internal status of the territory within Pakistan, for its human rights situation, for its ties with territories beyond the border, etc. Things that are specific to this topic. ''That'' should indeed be expanded. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 14:50, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
::::::I've got no objection to your statement.  My problem is, the articles currently treat these regions as if there is no dispute at all.  The existence of a dispute isn't mentioned, the effect the dispute has had on economies isn't mentioned, the way the dispute affects the lives of the people in the region isn't mentioned.  All of those should exist.  You may be correct that Darkness' draft focuses a bit too strongly on the debate as a whole and not how it affects the region; however, I feel that this should have a mention of the existence of a dispute at a minimum.  Perhaps the second paragraph of &quot;Autonomous status and present-day Gilgit–Baltistan&quot; should contain a reference to India's claim after &quot;Officially, Pakistan has rejected Gilgit–Baltistani calls for further integration on the grounds that it would prejudice its international obligations over the Kashmir dispute.&quot;  It is hard to create a plain insertion, because I feel that some rewriting will need to be done.&amp;nbsp;[[User:Ryan Vesey|'''''Ryan''''']]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Ryan Vesey|'''''Vesey''''']] 15:08, 30 July 2012 (UTC)

:::As Discussed here and before, [[Kashmir conflict]] is the article to deal with the dispute and it influences. The state articles can simply state an acknowledgement of a dispute by just telling the current area in control etc which is relevant to the administrative context of the topic. If at all a little more detail is needed, it would be more appropriate at Azad Kashmir article which used to be the whole entity until 1970, with this one being an administrative improvement. It would be funny to have dispute related material in each village article of the GB or Azad Kashmir if we go with this precedent. Each article is to cover it's own scope. --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:17, 31 July 2012 (UTC)
I think the proposed text isn't very clear, as reading the upper section of the article (even together with the proposed text) the relationship between e.g. Jammu and Kashmir to Gilgit-Baltistan remains quite mysterious: first the lead states that J&amp;K is a neighbouring region, then later we hear that G-B used to be part of J&amp;K. This may be clear to persons familiar with the issues, but it doesn't seem so to casual readers. These basic legibility issues should be improved before going to the level of detail in the proposal.  --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 20:08, 30 July 2012 (UTC)

*'''Exclude'''. As Fut.Perf says, duplication (as opposed to summarization) of parent article material is ugly and unnecessary, as well as disproportionate to such a short article. Also, Ryan made a smart admission when he said that he &quot;know[s] very little about the politics of India and Pakistan&quot;.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Gilgit%E2%80%93Baltistan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=504938548] Since he alluded to Taiwan, let me make an analogy. On some formal governmental level, there is a dispute between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China over control over &quot;all of China&quot;, including Taiwan. However, decades of ''de facto'' separation have given rise to a different issue: the issue of an emerging separate Taiwanese identity from the country of &quot;China&quot;, People's Republic or not.&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese case relates to Gilgit-Baltistan because by most reliable accounts of the ''facts on the ground'', Baltistanis fear and resent domination by Kashmiris, encouraged Pakistan's half-hearted attempts to separate it from Kashmir, and desire further integration into Pakistan proper. The biggest obstacle to Baltistani self-determination (within Pakistan, obviously; since India has not given its J&amp;K a referendum, fat chance they'll give G-B one) is in fact India's internationalization of the Kashmir issue, using an archaic and expansionist definition of &quot;Kashmir&quot; which ignores the contemporary desires of the inhabitants and all other state disputants. I only mention these issues because some participants have couched their support for the RfC language in moral terms; of Pakistan's supposed &quot;illegal occupation&quot;, etc. [[User:Shrigley|Shrigley]] ([[User talk:Shrigley|talk]]) 00:54, 9 August 2012 (UTC)

::::::: ''&quot;territory of Pakistan&quot;, which not to mention incites a sense of inherent belonging to Pakistan'' - but it ''does'' belong to Pakistan, it is part of the Pakistani federation. Just because it is not a ''province'' does ''not'' change anything. Not every subdivision has to be a province, many countries have federally administered territories that exist alongside states/provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan is not a province but an administrative territory &lt;u&gt;of Pakistan&lt;/u&gt;. The Kashmir dispute is mentioned in a paragraph in the lead and mentioning it in the opening sentence is hardly neutral. Moreover, the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] has an inaccurate lead and currently starts of like ''Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost state of India.'' Since you're so keen om arguing over this status quo, we can start with the J&amp;K article first, I propose the following lead for that article: ''Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost state under '''Indian control.''''' Enforcing double standards on this article while an article on an '''internationally disputed territory''' (Jammu and Kashmir) fails to mention the same is blatant POV push.

== Mar4d's edits ==

The article currently refers to &quot;Gilgit–Baltistan&quot; as ″territory of Pakistan″, not ″Disputed territory of Pakistan″, not ″territory under Pakistani control″, not ″Pakistan-administered territory″ just ″territory ''of'' Pakistan″ (notwithstanding the colossal international dispute it has been between India and Pakistan and what a redundant lump of diplomatic fiasco it has been at the UN) and when I asked others to change it to ″Pakistan-administered territory″ or something similar since that ''is'' objectively more neutral, Mar4d aggressively argued that since Gilgit Baltistan ''is'' indeed a territory of Pakistan it need not be changed. I took it to [[WP:NPOV/N]] and same thing with Mar4d even though I got ''some'' support, Mar4d with his usual [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Noticeboard&amp;oldid=550354327#Denying_the_obvious.3F obfuscatory chicanery contended] that Indian POV need not be mentioned in the first line, it just does not deserve a mention simply because it's ''only'' India who is arguing it. 

But amazingly enough when, to avoid the much hyped &quot;double-standard&quot; (touted everywhere by none other than Mar4d himself), I changed the language for Jammu and Kashmir from &quot;the Indian-administered state&quot; to &quot;state of India&quot; (following the same rationale as what was given to me about Gilgit-Baltistan) he cleverly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gilgit–Baltistan&amp;diff=550481379&amp;oldid=550312950 tries to argue] that I need to seek a consensus and uses that as a pretext to edit war.

::: Oh shut it please, I have had enough of your constant blabbering every now and then. &quot;Indian-administered&quot; was added before Jammu and Kashmir because the same wording is used on the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] article where it is referred to as a &quot;state of India&quot; and the Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan regions are called &quot;Pakistan-administered&quot; regions there. The same wording here is in uniformity with that. However, since you are so insistent on getting things done your way, I shall apply the same change at [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

First you manage to remove the term 'administered' before Jammu and Kashmir (which is effectively an Indian-administered territory) in this article, which I've reached a compromise on, and then you want the same word to be applied before Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir regions. What are you up to? '''[[User:Mar4d|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Mar4d&lt;/font&gt;]]''' ([[User talk:Mar4d|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]) 12:44, 16 April 2013 (UTC)

But now you are taking it further by trying to omit the fact that it's an administrative territory. &lt;p&gt;Well, ''now that I think of it'', it is as meaningless a change as the line it replaces.

:Hi [[User:Atelerix]].  I've reverted your edits as it's not clear to me how they're improving the article.  I'd like to hear your side as well.

::Just a note that Atelerix is blocked for 24 hours for edit warring. I did try initiating a discussion on the user's talk page, to no avail.

== POK and IOK ==

[Copied from [[User talk:Kautilya3]]]

Do you agree that all Indian administered Kashmir be called IOK and Pakistan administered Kashmir as POK ? [[User:Delljvc|Delljvc]] ([[User talk:Delljvc|talk]]) 12:38, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
: {{ping|Delljvc}} No, &quot;occupied&quot; is a loaded term.  We tend to say &quot;administered&quot; on Wikipedia.  Wherever the term &quot;occupied&quot; occurs on our pages, it needs to be replaced by &quot;administered&quot;.  However, if we are citing a source and the source uses the term &quot;occupied&quot;, we can't substitute that with something else. I noticed that you were replacing the titles of the newspaper articles to be different from what they were.  We don't do that. [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3#top|talk]]) 13:35, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
::{{u|Delljvc}} and {{u|Kautilya3}}, editors have gone over this repeatedly. Either add the POV terms of all sides in all articles or not add at all in any of them and use neutral terms like 'administered' or controlled (if in context). You can see the consensus here (editors from all sides participated) [[Talk:Azad Kashmir/Archives/2012/December]]. Hopefully this will end the moot discussion. Simply put PoK / IoK as a terminology or claims in [[Kashmir dispute]] and refrain from adding them (esp to the lede) of the three territory articles. --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 14:14, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

On the other hand, the version you have reinstated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gilgit%E2%80%93Baltistan&amp;diff=630932697&amp;oldid=630724184] has all of {{U|Delljvc}}'s POV.

:::: {{ping|TopGun}} By the way, Gilgit-Baltistan is not included as part of &quot;Pakistan&quot; in the Pakistan constitution.  So, calling it a &quot;territory of Pakistan&quot; is POV.  I changed it to &quot;territory of Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot;, which should not have an objection from anybody.

:::::It was already linked to Pakistani &quot;administrative&quot; territories. What you were saying was already there. Maybe you missed it.

::::::::Hey.. I just realized I was reading the diffs through the highlighted markup only and after seeing some new editors [[User_talk:TopGun#October_2014|recently reverting PoK in other articles]], I didn't notice that the word PoK was in the ''citation's title'' and not in the ''content''. I would have self reverted, had I noticed earlier; instead I was debating of not including PoK it in the content and sticking to neutrality with 'administered' as discussed numerous times. And I just saw where I was wrong after reading another editor's comment on my talkpage. I guess I've been a bit out of touch with the wiki markup. If it's just that you oppose, I guess there's no dispute. But if you also want to include the title citation refers in the ''content'', [[WP:BIASED|I would oppose that]] (hopefully that's not the case and it was just a mess up from myside). --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 16:51, 24 October 2014 (UTC)
::::::::: No problem.  Misunderstandings happen!  Perhaps, you can add a note on the [[WP:DRN]] referral that you agree with the changes and they can close the issue.
::::::::: {{ping|TopGun}} The ''only'' change I have made is to change &quot;territory of Pakistan&quot; in the lead to &quot;territory of Pakistan-administered Kashmir&quot;.  This change is because AJK and GB are not listed as part of &quot;Pakistan&quot; in the Pakistan constitution, whereas a &quot;territory&quot; of a country is normally understood to be its part.  I could also settle for &quot;administered territory of Pakistan&quot; if that sounds more neutral to you.

::::::::::I don't really have a problem with using administered (if you see I am actually favouring it). What I was saying was it is being referred to in the same sentence twice. The last suggest seems more sensible imo according to my previous comments, I wouldn't really oppose the current version too though it's a bit less elegant. For the PoK edits, I guess it was [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] from another dispute at [[AJK]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;lTopGunl&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:TopGun|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:16, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

== Semi-protected edit request on 18 May 2015 ==

{{edit semi-protected|Gilgit-Baltistan|answered=y}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;

Instead of using the term &quot;Azad Kashmir&quot; the term that should be used is &quot;Pakistan Administered Kashmir&quot; or &quot;Pakistan Occupied Kashmir&quot;. As Kashmir was always a part of India, only during the partition of India in 1947 the Pakistanis had sent in state sponsored terrorists to illegally occupy Kashmir.

Your edits are breaking Wiki syntax and removing sources and breaking up actual sentences in order to put the material the way ''you'' want to see it. You also insist on referring to the Twelver Shi'a as &quot;Shia&quot;, which may be used in the original broken English of the quote but is offensive to Ismailis, who are ''also'' Shi'a Muslims.
