==[[:Bianca Baxter]]==

A tag has been placed on [[:Bianca Baxter]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]]. If you can indicate why Bianca Baxter is really notable, you can contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Bianca Baxter]], explaining how Bianca Baxter is notable. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, articles #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt; --[[User:ArmadilloFromHell|&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''Armadillo'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''From'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Hell'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
