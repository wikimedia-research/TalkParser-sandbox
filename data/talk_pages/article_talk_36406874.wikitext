{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Power bank]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G1|section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for any other experiments you would like to do. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Power bank|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]].  &lt;!-- Template:Db-nonsense-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; '''[[User:Theopolisme|&lt;font color=#00B74A&gt;Theopolisme]] '''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_Talk:Theopolisme|&lt;font color=#37DB79&gt; TALK]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:41, 12 July 2012 (UTC)
