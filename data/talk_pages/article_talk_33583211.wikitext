----
Hello Rcsprinter123! The [[WP:WMF|WMF]] is currently developing new tools to make new page patrolling much easier. Whether you  have patrolled many pages or only a few, we now need to  know about your experience.  The survey takes only 6 minutes, and the information you provide will not be shared with third parties other than to assist us in analyzing the results of the survey; the WMF will not use the information to identify you.
* If this invitation  also appears on other accounts you  may  have, please complete the  survey  once only.  
* If this has been sent to you in error and you have never patrolled new pages, please ignore it.
'''Please click [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/9RSKYC9 HERE] to take part.'''&lt;br&gt;
Many thanks in advance for providing this essential feedback. 
----
&lt;small&gt;You are receiving this invitation because you  have patrolled new pages. For more information, please see [[Wikipedia:New pages patrol/Survey|NPP Survey]]. [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 12:57, 26 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

It's probably best to only non-admin close AfDs as &quot;SNOW&quot; if there is unanimity in the comments.  There wasn't in the one you closed, so I've re-closed it.  Also, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shelby Ford]] should've probably be closed as no consensus (2 vs 3 and weak arguments).  Whilst NAC closures at AfD are useful, it's probably best to steer away from anything that's not completely obvious.  I was pointed here by a [[WP:ANI]] thread that you don't seem to have been informed of, by the way.  Thanks, &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Black Kite|Black Kite (t)]]&lt;/font&gt;  01:45, 28 October 2011 (UTC)
:I agree with black kite WRT Shelby Ford but the the first one was borderline NACable. However, you didn't use a very good closing rationale. Quoting [[WP:SNOW]] wasn't needed as the AFD had run the full 7 days and it also strongly suggested that you counted !votes and that makes a lot AFD participants see red. A better closing rationale would have been something like ''There is a strong consensus here that this event is more then routine and therefore the subject passes WP:EVENT&quot;. --[[User:Ron Ritzman|Ron Ritzman]] ([[User talk:Ron Ritzman|talk]]) 12:24, 28 October 2011 (UTC)

May I make a request of you since I am going? - please look in on the doings at the article. Two editors there are bullying and dictating like mad. I see they've been at it for at least a year or so.

== Steampunk ==

I have no intention of responding to the hysterical claims of an editor who began by making demands that other editors change the Steampunk article, who then made repeated personal attacks against myself and other editors, and who repeatedly forum-shops looking for editors or admins to take his side.  I said everything I intend to say on this matter at [[User:Orangemike|Orangemike]]'s talk page, where I received no reply, other than more comments from the anonymous user.  I am done with Steampunk, and all related articles, which I suppose the anon. can take as some sort of victory.  Life is simply too short to repeatedly deal with this nonsense.  Today, the anon. left another [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARepublicanJacobite%2FAlternate&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=458639539&amp;oldid=458310733 provocative message] on my alternate talk page.

== User: Republican Jacobite. Help me with him, I beg you! ==

Hello. So sorry to pop over and bother you, you've been kind and helpful.

Republican Jacobite has now gone whining to an admin username Neelix, to screech about getting in trouble. Let me remind you that RJ attacked me the moment I posted at [[Steampunk]] - and he's not stopped screaming since then.

Please, grant me this assistance and take a gander at Neelix's talk. RJ posted a comment under the title of my IP address. RJ is creating a real tempest in a teapot, but he's vindictive, childish and paranoid now.

I told everyone I was leaving activity - I did not say I'd take my eye off this character! I tell you, RJ is trouble and has been for a long time.[[Special:Contributions/75.21.113.40|75.21.113.40]] ([[User talk:75.21.113.40|talk]]) 01:12, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

== Steampunk dispute ==

Hi Sprinter,

I just received your message on my talk page. Are your comments directed towards the IP address user involved in the dispute or to me?

[[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 16:20, 3 November 2011 (UTC)
:Kind of everyone. Telling you, telling off the IP and just kind of continuing the conversation. Wouldn't be involved but see two sections above to find out why I am :). &lt;font color=&quot;#7026DF&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:cambria; font-size:11pt; color:gray&quot;&gt;Rcsprinter&lt;/span&gt;]]''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:calibri; font-size:9pt; color:black&quot;&gt;(talk to me)&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 16:22, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

''Stupid'' of me to think you might have helped in this - which by the way is all over, except I have to keep chasing all the garbage RJ has spread round all Wikipedia. So glad you sided with RJ, I thought you might.

Say, if you really want out of this, how about you stay off the other talks where I am in discussion with the editors? Like Neelix for starters? What is between them and me does not concern you. How/why ''did you track me to a totally separate editor's page where we were having a discussion that totally did not involve you'' to put your two cents in? You know who I mean![[Special:Contributions/75.21.156.42|75.21.156.42]] ([[User talk:75.21.156.42|talk]]) 17:20, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

What is going on with this IP?  Do you have reason to believe they are the same person as the blocked [[User:99.70.66.43]]?

:They might be, but I'm nothing to do with it. What is going on is the IP wrote some stuff on [[Steampunk]], RepublicanJacobite reverted it, they edit warred, I stepped in, we spoke on a million different talkpages, for some reason ending up on yours. And I'm not a she. &lt;font color=&quot;#00ACF4&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:cambria; font-size:11pt; color:gray&quot;&gt;Rcsprinter&lt;/span&gt;]]''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:calibri; font-size:9pt; color:black&quot;&gt;(Gimme a message)&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:11, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

::Fairly unlikely. The 99 IP geolocates to California, whereas the 75 IP geolocates to Illinois. The writing styles, as well as their understanding of Wikipedia is vastly different. The 75 IP clearly has a good understanding of Wikipedia's process, whereas the 99 IP appears to be new to Wikipedia. Both IPs are in a dispute with RepublicanJacobite, but on two different content disputes. Based on the fact that he often reverts non-vandalism IP changes, it is quite conceivably possible that he got in a dispute with two different IPs in a similar time period. The 99 IP was blocked for 24 hours for edit warring. I am not sure why JamesBWatson put a week long block on that particular IP. A range block would be needed to keep either dynamic IP from editing, as both of the IP addresses change about every 6 hours. At this point, I believe this issue can be resolved fairly easily, without the use of [[WP:BLOCK|blocks]].

== Questions about recreation of [[John Albert (fighter)]] ==

A couple months ago you closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John Albert (fighter)]] to redirect the article to [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Bisping vs. Team Miller]]. Yesterday the article was recreated (or rather the redirect removed).  The contents of the article compared to prior to the AfD is the same except now there is actually prose in the article.  I don't see anything that changes the notability of the individual in the last couple of months.  If the AfD result were delete, I'd simply put this article up for speedy deletion under criteria G4. Since it was redirected, I'm unsure what to do.  Does it need to go up for AfD again or is there another route to take?  Thanks.  --[[User:TreyGeek|TreyGeek]] ([[User talk:TreyGeek|talk]]) 21:44, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

Hey! It's been a good few months since the '''[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bacon/Bacon Challenge/2012|Bacon Challenge 2012]]''' kicked off in June, and I'm pleased to say that decent progress has been made.

Here's a quick rundown of the overall positions as they stand:
*&lt;font color=&quot;#FFCC33&quot;&gt;'''1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;: [[User:Silver seren|Silver seren]]
*&lt;font color=&quot;#BAC3CC&quot;&gt;'''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;: [[User:Worm That Turned|Worm That Turned]]
*&lt;font color=&quot;#A55858&quot;&gt;'''3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;: [[User:Rcsprinter123|Rcsprinter123]]
*'''4th''': [[User:Doh5678|Doh5678]]
*'''5th''': [[User:Cirt|Cirt]]
Currently, only a handful of participants have reported contributions: to those who haven't, remember, there is still plenty of time left to contribute and rise up in through the positions, as the Challenge and WikiCup run up until March. Just like last year, all participants will receive a shiny medal which they can place on their userpages, or use as a self-esteem booster if need be (just joking...sort of). If you need ideas for what to work on, a list is available [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Bacon/Bacon_Challenge/2012#Things_to_Work_On|here]].

One last thing! Per request, '''we are bringing back territory representation''' into the WikiCup! Editors can now represent nations, states, or provinces, just to add a bit of fun and Olympic-flair to the event. Simply reply to this message with the territory you wish to represent, if you choose to do so.

Thanks for reading! Good luck! &lt;b&gt;~&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#07517C&quot;&gt;[[User:SuperHamster|Super]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6FA23B&quot;&gt;[[User:SuperHamster|Hamster]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:SuperHamster|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/SuperHamster|Contribs]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:02, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

rv- Just nonsense- Lloyds of London is Insurance- not a high street bank.  (Second time- dab solver is wrong). Can you educate the little bot that in Medway - Lloyds means Lloyds of London not LloydsTSB! It really needs to get over its fixation! :)--[[User:ClemRutter|ClemRutter]] ([[User talk:ClemRutter|talk]]) 20:02, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

== AfD close ==

I think your close of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bundle (software distribution)]] was premature. This deletion discussion should result in ''some consensus about the topic of the article''. I just rewrote [[Bundle (software distribution)]] based on the definition I assume the &quot;keep&quot; !votes wanted. When I finished the second version I started to move it to [[Bundled software]] and discovered that page already existed as a disambiguation page, which now suggests a redirect with possible merge. Seems inappropriate to do that right after an AfD. Would you consider undoing your close so consensus on the rough definition can be reached? – [[User:Pnm|Pnm]] ([[User talk:Pnm|talk]]) 19:29, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
:OK, I have undone the close. &lt;font color=&quot;#00ACF4&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:cambria; font-size:10pt; color:gray&quot;&gt;Rcsprinter&lt;/span&gt;]]''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:calibri; font-size:8pt; color:black&quot;&gt;(chatter)&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 20:34, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks. Would you please update the article and talk pages too? I'm hoping some of the keep votes weigh in. – [[User:Pnm|Pnm]] ([[User talk:Pnm|talk]]) 21:00, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
