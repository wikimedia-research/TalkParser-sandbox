==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:The Network Program]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:The Network Program]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] as well as [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:The Network Program|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:The Network Program|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; '''&lt;font color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;[[User:Xtzou|Xtzou]]&lt;/font&gt;''' ''(&lt;font color=&quot;#008080&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Xtzou|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;)'' 19:44, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but in this &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Network_Program?diff=366860440 recent edit]&lt;/span&gt; you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from [[:The Network Program]], a page you have created yourself.  If you do not believe the page should be deleted, you can place a {{[[Template:hangon|hangon]]}} tag on the page, under the existing speedy deletion tag (please do not remove the speedy deletion tag), and make your case on the page's talk page. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-hugglespeedy1 --&gt; [[User:Uncle Dick|Uncle Dick]] ([[User talk:Uncle Dick|talk]]) 20:13, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Please do not remove [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] notices from pages you have created yourself, as you did with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Network_Program?diff=366860605 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:The Network Program]].  Please use the {{[[Template:hangon|hangon]]}} template on the page instead if you disagree with the deletion, and make your case on the page's talk page. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-hugglespeedy2 --&gt; [[User:Uncle Dick|Uncle Dick]] ([[User talk:Uncle Dick|talk]]) 20:13, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
