[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/162.227.241.31|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Culture of Panama]] because it did not appear constructive. If you would like to experiment, you can use the [[WP:sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Flyer22|my talk page]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;  [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]] ([[User talk:Flyer22|talk]]) 21:04, 25 November 2013 (UTC)
