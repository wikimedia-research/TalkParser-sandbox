Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:Anish Kapoor]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=558015630&amp;oldid=557637218 here] to [[Anish Kapoor]] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]].  The external link(s) you added or changed (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70FwPUhDO4&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \byoutube\.com) --&gt;) is/are on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[Wikipedia:Media|media]] file (e.g. a [[Wikipedia:Media help|sound or video]] file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright policy]], as well as other parts of our [[WP:ELNO|external links guideline]].  If the information you linked to is indeed in violation of copyright, then such information should not be linked to.  Please consider using our [[Wikipedia:Upload|upload]] facility to upload a suitable media file, or consider linking to the original.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam0 --&gt; --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 19:24, 2 June 2013 (UTC)
