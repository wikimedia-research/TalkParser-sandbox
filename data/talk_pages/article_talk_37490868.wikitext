[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Sue Rangell|Sue Rangell]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/70.246.230.120|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Agra]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Sue Rangell|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Sue Rangell|Sue Rangell]]&lt;sup class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;[[Wikipedia:Don't be a dick|''&lt;span title=&quot;This user is a total snood&quot; style=&quot;white-space: nowrap;&quot;&gt;citation needed&lt;/span&gt;'']]&amp;#93;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 30 October 2012 (UTC)
