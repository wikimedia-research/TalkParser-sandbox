==Keep it cool, keep it fresh==
Hi DreamingLady,

I've noticed in (some of) your latest edits there seems to be a bit of a frustration boiling up. Though I can wholeheartedly understand the frustration that Wiki-ing sometimes brings with it, I find it best to [[Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot|stay cool]]. It's taken me some time to figure it out, yet I gladly pass it on as advice.

Feel free to let me know if you've got any comments ;-)

Happy editting

Great. I'm new to wikipedia, so I'm not sure if this is the way to talk to other users. Nevertheless, you'll probably see it anyway. :) Actually, it's not like I'm angry or anything, I just wished people wouldn't act so fanboyish. I mean, &quot;Ralis looks like Komali????&quot; Seriously, they are making that up to fit their prefered version of the Rito-Zora thing. But I'm more sarcastic about it than anything else, and I'm sarcastic 24/7. So it doesn't really mean much. one of the only two reasons I joined Wikipedia is to stop this kind of fanboy vandalism. So, yeah, I pretty much can't stand this stuff, but I don't let it get to me even though it appears I do.

BTW. The other reason I joined is to make proper pages for games that deserve it, but don't have a big enough group of fans. At the moment, I'm working on Geist, but I have a bit of trouble with the reception section. Do you have any clue if and where I can find sales charts for not-overhyped games?[[User:DreamingLady|DreamingLady]] 23:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:Hi thar,
:I can understand ;-)
:I'm glad to hear you're ok. Yet, better to be safe then sorry right? And it can never hurt to say hi to anyone. (when dealing with normal people that is =p)
:http://www.vgcharts.org is often good on video game sales, though as they state themselves, they're not flawless. Just keep that in mind.
:As for Geist, that's a good one. I wouldn't know one. I'll look for it, though I think it's gonna be a though one and you might not get any further then one early press release, if at all.
:Keep me updated on it if you like, and feel free to ask me anything anytime.

== Geist ==

Hey DreamingLady,

If you'd like, I can help out with GA'ing Geist.
If you could use some help, just tell me what you need me to do.

::Is it worth it to mention who did what in creating this game? Some game pages have a Voice Cast section, but I don't get why only the voice actors and the people who already have a big name should be mentioned. Is there a particular reason why no other pages have credits section (some rule on Wikipedia I don't know of?) or is it just a matter of choice and am I free to add it?
:'''It is a matter of choice, and you are more then free to add it. If you want, there is no one stopping you from adding in everyone. The only reason it's not done, is because it's a lot of work.'''

::When is it a good idea to split the character section? Or any section that is practically a list (weapons, enemies, characters, locations).
:'''In the case of Geist, just keep it short. Single game character articles are usually deleted, because WP is not a gamesguide. That's the most important thing to remember too, don't write it as if a games guide.'''

::Is there a criteria for who's opinions (reviews) count and if so, what?
:'''Not a set case of criteria, and if it's a less reviewed game, or there is a very good outstanding one, you can add it, but my advice would be to go by [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess#Reception]]. Like I said, if there's a real good one, [[WP:BOLD|be bold]] and add it. '''

::Any general advice on good places to find info is nice. Or a place that has audio samples or scanned manuals of games.
:'''Audio samples are dangerous, because of copyright. I'm not sure how those work. Scans the same.'''

::Any idea what kind of sections I could add or which one(s) really need improvement (Reception?)? If not GA status improvement, then what sections would need for FA status improvement.
:'''I'm gonna take a good look at it this weekend, and I'll let you know =)'''


:Sorry for the wait. I've been a bit busy lately.
:Hope this helps for now! I'll get back to you soon.

Hey, thanks for getting my pic of Pathways Into Darkness back up where it belongs.  I owe you one. [[User:White bishop|White_Bishop]] 15:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)



== Your [[WP:GA|GA]] nomination of [[Geist (video game)]]==

The article [[Geist (video game)]] you nominated as a [[Wikipedia:Good article candidates|good article]] has passed [[Image:Symbol support vote.png|25px]], see [[Talk:Article]] for eventual comments about the article. Good luck in future nominations. [[User:Funpika|Funpika]] 23:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== Geist ==

Sorry. I didn't pay attention at the username, that's why I put &quot;some guy&quot;. OK, it was only twice at the GAC, but was in such a short time, and already had a &quot;GA failed&quot; before, that's why I joked. 

I put it in the CVG assessment to help, since you were doing a huge effort at the article, and an external view other than the GA people would give some ideas for improvement. And congrats for the approval.  [[User:Igordebraga|igordebraga]] [[User_talk:Igordebraga|â‰ ]] 14:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

== FPA ==

Isn't the ''Metroid Prime'' games listed as first-person adventures?

== Zelda:TP Gerudo theory ==
You asked: &quot;You mean the Gerudo Mesa where the portal to Midna's world is located? Think about that before you put that theory back on the page.&quot;

Yes I meant that, anything wrong with it? I didn't put it as a fact, but as a theory, just to spark some discussion between people. Since I didn't present it as a fact I have no idea why you decided to delete it... I'm not the first to speculate of such theory, as I researched on some forums beforehand. Explain why it can't be in the page. If things such as speculation aren't allowed in the articles (even though I've seen a lot of them around and not being removed) then forget what I wrote. Thanks.

== Game manuals ==

Hi DreamingLady,

I found the website I was looking for/thinking of for you, that has game manual scans:&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.replacementdocs.com/news.php replacementdocs.com] or easier to remember:&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.gamemanuals.net gamemanuals.net]

Hope it helps. And great work on your articles so far :D

I looked back at [[Lady Sia]], to see what had happened after I had assessed it, and saw what an amazing job you've been doing there over the last few weeks.  You've singlehandedly turned it from a small stub to an almost GA-class article, and if that doesn't deserve a barnstar, I don't know what does.  --[[User:PresN|PresN]] 04:58, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

==AfD nomination of [[Masks from The Legend of Zelda series]]==
An editor has nominated [[Masks from The Legend of Zelda series]], an article on which you have worked or that you created, for [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion]].  We appreciate your contributions, but the nominator doesn't believe that the article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion and has explained why in his/her nomination (see also &quot;[[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot;).  Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at {{#if:Masks from The Legend of Zelda series | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Masks from The Legend of Zelda series]] | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Masks from The Legend of Zelda series]] }} and please be sure to [[WP:SIG|sign your comments]] with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the [[WP:AfD|articles for deletion]] template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate.  Thank you.  '''Please note:''' This is an automatic notification by a [[WP:BOT|bot]]. I have nothing to do with this article or the deletion nomination, and can't do anything about it.
