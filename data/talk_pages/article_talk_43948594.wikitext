[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:10A8:2D:3FBE:18BA:B4C:94E6|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enfamil&amp;diff=627039177 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Enfamil]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Jim1138|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]] ([[User talk:Jim1138|talk]]) 15:53, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
