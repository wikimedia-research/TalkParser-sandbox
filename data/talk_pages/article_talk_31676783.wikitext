The article [[Circle of Sisterhood]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''Non-notable organization. [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Ginny+was+aware+that+the+sorority+movement+itself+came+forth+out+of+oppression.+In+the+mid+1800s%2C+women+in+the+United+States+did#q=%22Circle+of+Sisterhood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=8pPBTYPzE67YiALgxeWbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CA4Q_AUoAw&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=44cf8ba1d72a0eb3 Zero] Google news hits for &quot;Circle of Sisterhood&quot;. Moreover, this article is little more than an advertising piece. Its references are Wikipedia links.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Circle of Sisterhood|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Fang Aili|Fang Aili]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Fang Aili|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 4 May 2011 (UTC)
