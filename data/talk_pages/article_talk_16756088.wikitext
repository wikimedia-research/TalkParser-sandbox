==[[WP:NOTE]] Removal==
I deleted the [[WP:NOTE|notability]] tag on this article on the grounds that this establishment is basis for a main-stream movie with prominent American actors such as [[Liv Tyler]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[John Goodman]], and [[Reba McEntire]]. Additionally, it is well-known in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] community as a reputable bar.
