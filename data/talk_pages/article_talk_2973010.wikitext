==Cleanup==
*Clean up clutter (Beautiful Arabo-Persian letters that curve like a sexy womans' body, but still clutter)
*&lt;strike&gt;Make the Rulers of Persia template more attractive and colorful (check out the [[Template:WWIITheatre|WWII]] template).&lt;/strike&gt; Done, for this article and for immediate predecessor &amp; successor.  Repeat for other articles as neccessary.
*Continue to use BCE dating and ''add dates of his reign in ancient dating systems where appropriate, if appropriate.  Same if you think AH dates are appropriate, since he is still revered in modern Iran.''
*&lt;strike&gt;Definitely ''do not'' mention [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] (we all love him, but he doesn't belong here).&lt;/strike&gt;  That was mostly intended as a joke - and maybe, just maybe - mention of him might belong here.  How did his family come to adopt that surname?  Was one of his ancestors a fan of Xenophon or Sir Thomas Browne, or perhaps an evangelical Christian who read about the King of Persia in his KJV?  If anybody can dig the information up in a published source, they should feel free to put it here. --[[User:Jpbrenna|Jpbrenna]] 21:36, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::Wait, they should put it in the Billie Ray Cyrus article, and have it link here.  Ok, ''why'' am I obsessing over this issue?  Time to go do something productive - like mowing the lawn.
:Looks like a good plan of action.  I will help out with the clean-up.  With respect to the reproduction of the Persian characters, I do think they look good.  Take a look at [[I Ching]] for an example of the reproduction of letters of the native language pertinent to the article.  Perhaps we could get other authors of articles on Persia (such as [[User: SouthernComfort]] or [[User: Zereshk]]) to comment. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 16:27, 2005 May 23 (UTC)

I think it would be good to include a bit more biblical reference, namely the fact that Isaiah prophesied the coming of Cyrus to overthrow Babylon 100 years before Cyrus was born. Isaisah 45:1-4 &quot;1)Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him...2) I will go before thee...I will break in pieces the gates of brass...4)...I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me.&quot;  Indeed, the Bible has a lot to do with it....

:''This decree was discovered &quot;at Achmetha [R.V. marg., &quot;[[Ecbatana]]&quot;], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes&quot; (Ezra 6:2).''

What does that mean? Where and when was the decree discovered? What does the Bible have to do with anything? Man, this Bible dictionary really sucks. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 21:31 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)

== Yes, but... ==

I just wanted to give props to whoever wrote this article - and, I assume, a lot of the near-east history articles - for doing stuff like digging up historical figures' real names, like Sharrukin and Koroush. Lord knows the Anglicized and Latinized versions are what people know these days, but having an idea of what these guys called *themselves* can only provide that much more of a connection to the past.

:I too give &quot;props&quot; the inclusion of English transliterations of the Persian names in addition to the Latinized Hellenized forms that have come down to us, but I think it should be noted that the ancient Persians did not use the Arabo-Persian alphabet.  All these names are given in the modern rendering, and though they are pretty close to how the Persians in question would have ''pronounced'' their own names, they do not reflect how they would have ''spelled'' them.  If only we could get Pahlavi fonts to work here, we could include those spellings too.  Which gives me another idea: how about a chart of Persian names in their Pahlavi, Arabo-Persian, Greek and Anglo-Latin forms, for comparison? --[[User:Jpbrenna|Jpbrenna]] 20:52, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Another thing... ==

The transliteration of Cyrus's name as given at the top of the article would be &quot;Koroush Kabir.&quot;  But &quot;kabir&quot; is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word.  Wouldn't they have called him something else in pre-Arab times? Like &quot;Koroush Bozorg?&quot; Or did they use some form of &quot;Kabir&quot; via [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].  --[[User:Jpbrenna|Jpbrenna]] 19:41, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Dates and numbers in this article==
'''Wikipedia policy is clear on the use of [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Eras|Eras]] in articles''':

:''Both the BCE/CE era names and the BC/AD era names are acceptable, but be consistent within an article. Normally you should use plain numbers for years in the Common Era, but when events span the start of the Common Era, use AD or CE for the date at the end of the range (note that AD precedes the date and CE follows it). For example, [[1 BC]]–[[1|AD 1]] or [[1 BCE]]–[[1|1 CE]].

It is up to the author(s) of an article to determine the dating system to be used and there must be consistency with each article.  In this case, for a non-Christian topic in a non-Christian region of the world, BCE/CE appears to make the most sense.  [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 17:59, 2005 May 22 (UTC)

::The authors of the article appeared quite happy with BC/AD until Slrubenstein's friends decided to implement his failed proposal - which is already quite divisive and causes enormous offence to many people worldwide. Why do you wish to perpetuate this silly offensive dispute? [[User:Jguk|jguk]] 18:09, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't know who you mean by &quot;Slrubenstein's friends.&quot;  Perhaps we could take a poll of authors of this article and other articles on Persia and other non-Christian regions of the world to see which dating system they prefer.  [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 18:16, 2005 May 22 (UTC)
::::Using AD for this guy makes about as much sense as putting his name in the anachronistic Arabic alphabet and using the Arabic &quot;kabeer.&quot;  But since we're doing that, we might as well be consistently whacked and us &quot;AD&quot; as well.  --[[User:Jpbrenna|Jpbrenna]] 18:39, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::I'm not sure I understand your logic here.  Would &quot;two wrongs don't make a right,&quot; perhaps apply? [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 19:04, 2005 May 22 (UTC)
::::::Yes, it would. I guess what I mean to say is that the whole AD/CE issue is just one of the ''many'' problems with this article, which aren't being addressed.  There's a lot more that needs to be changed than that.

So far we have one author of this article ([[User: Jpbrenna]]), who has indicated his preferance for BCE/CE.  Anyone else who has worked on this article care to weigh in?  Meanwhile, I will revert to that.  [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 06:43, 2005 May 23 (UTC)

==Use of language==
...these Arabo-Persian spellings aren't somehow more &quot;authentic&quot; than the Latinate names.  Cyrus the Great didn't spell his name &quot;Cyrus,&quot; but he didn't spell it  &amp;#1705;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1588; either.  Actually, he probably didn't spell anything at all -- he dictated to a bunch of scribes.
At the beginning of the article, it should give Cyrus's Latinate name (which is what he is most commonly known by in English), followed by Old Persian cuneiform (when technically feasible), followed by a Latin-alphabet transliteration of the Old Persian with appropriate diacritics.  ''Then'' we should give the Modern Persian and Greek spellings.  The Arabo-Persian spellings of names other than Cyrus should be taken out and put in their respective articles.  Yes, these people remain important to modern Iranians, and many of them were important in Greek literature as well, and we should include those spellings.  But &amp;#1705;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1580;&amp;#1740;&amp;#1607; etc. just clutter up this article.  &amp;#1705;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1580;&amp;#1740;&amp;#1607; belongs at the beginning of the [[Cambyses]] article, and nowhere else.

:they are not more 'authentic' but they are very appropriate considering that persia, basically, has had roughly the same borders for thousands of years, and many modern iranians consider themselves  in the lineage of cyrus the great, and modern iranians use arabic letters if i am not mistaken, and have for many hundred years.

Readers come to learn an encylopaedia to learn about what they want to know. And we should provide text to them that they find easy to read (from a stylistic point of view). Writing in a style that suits US academics is just not appropriate - almost all of our readers are not US academics. We should write in a style that suits them. It is not by chance that Encarta, Britannica, www.historychannel.com, www.discoverychannel.com, and others choose BC/AD. It is because they recognise that that is the style the world uses nowadays (and by an overwhelming advantage at that). Since you and I have come to agreement that we should put our readers first, I am surprised that you continue to preach invective rather than address quite what it is that our readers expect.

== Cyrus Cylinder ==

I object to this sentence in the opening paragraph:
:''He is perhaps best known for having declared the first ever charter of human rights (the [[Cyrus Cylinder]])''
For the following reasons:
#The Cyrus Cylinder is not a &quot;[[charter]]&quot;.
#The Cyrus Cylinder has nothing to do with [[human rights]].
#In no way is Cyrus the Great &quot;best known&quot; for issuing it.
--[[User:JW1805|JW1805]] 22:29, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

As far as I can say - and my view is confirmed by a really remarkable part of people and historians - the declaration of Babylon contains a really amazing amount of ideas which represent thoughts and values protected by a modern understanding of &quot;human rights&quot;: e. g. Cyrus condemns slavery (throughout the world!), regards the freedom of religion and the freedom of choice of profession as elementar rights of individuals, he strictly fights the violation of rights etc. The modern ideas of &quot;human rights&quot; are rather seen on the base of  some occidental philosophical and social developments. However, this is not contradictory to the fact that similar ideas and values were expressed, realized and even translated into policy by some other, ancient cultures with different philosophical and religious origins and experience. Regarding the question wether the word &quot;charter&quot; is  used correctly it would be of value to emphasize that the other, perhaps more adequate term often used in order to depict this document is &quot;declaration&quot;. Furthermore, here Cyrus identifies himself as the &quot;King of Iran&quot; (and not &quot;King of Persia&quot; which would correspond to the Greek term used for that country). (195.93.60.145)

*The text is available [http://www.ahura.info/cylinder.html here].  In no way is that a &quot;Charter of Human Rights&quot;.  It is the decree of an absolute monarch who is saying &quot;I am great, I am just, etc.&quot;  A standard declaration that would be issued after a great victory.  It doesn't &quot;condem slavery throughout the world!&quot; or say anything about the &quot;elementary rights of individuals&quot;.  Such concepts would have been alien to this time.--[[User:JW1805|JW1805]] 03:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

*Also, it doesn't say &quot;King of Iran&quot;.--[[User:JW1805|JW1805]] 19:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)




* Cyrus the Great has been regarded and respected as a symbol of tolerance throughout history and cultures (even by the Bible and the Old Greeks (see e. g. Herodot)). In this document, he defines visions of individual rights which should not be violated by anyone and he declares that he will defend such rights against violators: rights such as freedom of religion, freedom of profession, prevention and prohibition of slavery: 
&quot;I prevent unpaid, forced labor. Today, I announce that everyone is free to choose a religion. People are free to live in all regions and take up a job provided that they never violate other's rights... I prevent slavery and my governors and subordinates are obliged to prohibit exchanging men and women as slaves within their own ruling domains. Such a traditions should be exterminated the world over. &quot; Of course, he did declare a clear opposition to slavery &quot;the world over&quot;. Self-evidently, the terminology used  in ancient iranian times was not exactly the same as today regarding modern philosophical developments. But the values defined, expressed and defended here (more than 2544 years ago) by a king who would have been able to act in another way (but did not) are the same.
Furthermore, Cyrus defines himself as the King of &quot;Iran&quot; and not as the King of &quot;Persia&quot; which is a term used in Old Greece and consequently in European languages:
&quot; Now that I put the crown of kingdom of Iran ... Until I am the king of Iran&quot; etc.

See for example the precise translation by '''The Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies at The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) - University of London''' which is the only higher education institution in the UK specialising in the study of Asia and Africa: link:

*I question the accuracy of that website.  See my comments at [[Talk:Cyrus Cylinder]].  The bit at the end (with the &quot;I abolish slavery&quot;, and &quot;I will impose my monarchy on no nation&quot; language) seems remarkable intact, compared to the other sections which have gaps (corresponding to places where the clay has chipped off.  Other translations on other websites don't contain this last part.  I would like to see a translation from a more reputable source.  On the face of it, it seems dubious.  Of course slavery was part of the Persian Empire, and of course the Empire was based on conquest.  The modern concept of &quot;human rights&quot; would have been completely alien to people at this time.  --[[User:JW1805|JW1805]] 19:27, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

:: What are you saying? Slavery in Persian Empire? As Cyrus the Great said in his cylinder, he mentioned that i payed all those who worked for me. That was what separated Persians and Greeks.

== Bozorg not Kabir ==

the persian word for great is '''Bozorg''' and not '''Kabir'''

kabir is an Arabic word.

[[User:Gol|Gol]] 10:38, 24 March 2006 (UTC)


:: There is no doubt that Kabir is an Arabic word. But it is also a word in Farsi. Persian in English language means Farsi and not Parsi (old Persian). Korosh-e Kabir is the most common used name of Cyrus the Great in Persian (Farsi). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:66.36.157.210|66.36.157.210]] ([[User talk:66.36.157.210|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.36.157.210|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

::: Kabir or Bozorg in this sense are used interchangibly. The fact that Kabir is originated from Arabic makes Kabir a bit more formal. Like you do not use Kabir to describe a thing but you would for a king but you use Bozorg for a king and for a thing. Arabic to Persian is like Latin or French to English. In fact the only text I have read with little or almost no Arabic word in Persian is [[Shahnameh]] and I am impressed how [[Ferdowsi]] could do it. If you try to use pure Persian words only, say in the Iranian capital, Tehran, you could hardly be understood in a day-to-day conversation. Also remember once I tried to read one of very Persianized book of Nashre-Daneshgaahi on Physics. I could hardly understood the text without the help English glossary at the end of the book. They had used &quot;Kheft&quot; for &quot;Toul&quot; (Length in English) and &quot;Behanjaaresh&quot; for &quot;Normal Kardan&quot; (Normaliztion in English)! Mind you, some of those efforts have been good and successfull. Sometimes, I envy Americans for not being have to care too much about purity of their language and they use whatever comes into their language. [[User:203.48.45.194|203.48.45.194]] 01:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

::::Arabic is to Persian certainly not at all like Latin is to French or English. First off, French is based on Latin, whereas English is a Germanic language, i.e., not based on Latin. Second off, Persian (Farsi) once existed independent of Arabic influences. Arabic words in Farsi are an advent of the Arabic invasion of Islam in the 700s AD, while Iran and Persian language has existed since c. 550BBC. Arabic words are used in day to day language in Iran, but there is a long history of a movement to preserve Persian as a &quot;pure&quot; language (Firdawsi's Shanamah brought Persian back into popular use after a few centuries of Arabic-only usage in Iran). While some Iranians use Kabir rather than Bozorg in everyday use, the proper Persian translation of Great is indeed Bozorg and that's how it should be listed.

That took a while, but I managed to clean up the article, add a lot of information, add in footnotes and actual references, the [[Template:Infobox Military Person]] box à la [[Alexander the Great]], got rid of the now-useless &quot;see also&quot; section, etc. Don't get me wrong, '''this isn't even CLOSE to being a [[WP:GA|Good article]] yet.''' So, my fellow Wikipedians, I ask of you to join me in my crusade (*ahem*), in improving this article all the way to Featured Article status. So, let's get cracking!

== Request for Comment filed ==

I have filed a request for comment at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/History and geography]]. The details for which are as follows, copied from the RfC page:
:''[[Cyrus the Great]] is in an edit war between myself, [[User:SG]], and [[User:Spahbod]]. We have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_the_Great&amp;action=history reached the three-revert-rule], and so the article is in a state of limbo for the next little while. Here is my revert: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_the_Great&amp;diff=65898515&amp;oldid=65897326], the reasons for which are the fact that the additions made are poorly written and that the images are NOT free (licensed as GPL, when they clearly are not). The images in question are [[:Image:2500 sal4.jpg]] and [[:Image:Cyrus3.jpg]]. I have tagged them as improperly licensed, but Spahbod continues to revert my tagging. The discussions for this can be found on our user talk pages at: [[User_talk:SG#Cyrus_the_great]] and [[User_talk:Spahbod#Recent_image_uploads]].''
[[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 05:12, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
:An update from me, it is highly likely that I used the wrong template to tag the above images. Nevertheless, they are incorrectly tagged as GPL. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 05:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

I have reported you for vandalism, and personal attacks, which clearly you have done. And in the future please refrain from changing image info, or you will be blocked for vandalism.

:Actually, I believe SG is correct. These images are clearly not GFDL. Please read [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]], [[Wikipedia:Fair use]] and [[Wikipedia:Fair use criteria]] before uploading any additional images from other websites. The sites in question do in fact have copyright statements which allow for limited non-commercial use. Wikipedia does not allow images under that rationale. (see [[Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ#Non-commercial licenses]].) It is possible that the images might be used under [[fair use]], if they conform to Wikipedia's policy on that, but there are conditions for that which you will find at the previous links.

==Cyrus Portrat==
It would be nice to make it obvious if the portrat that begins the article is likely an actual depiction of the historical figure or just an artists depiction.  It doesn't seem very clear and
could be quite misleading I think. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:128.113.146.66|128.113.146.66]] ([[User talk:128.113.146.66|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/128.113.146.66|contribs]]) 21:35, 27 July 2006.&lt;/small&gt;
:That is true. --[[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] 18:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:Good point. It is definitely an artist's depiction of Cyrus, as that type of drawing had not been around during his time (as far as I know), and probably would not survive until now. There's a possibilty that it was copied from a relief, but I don't know about that. Until we can find some real sourcing, how about we just call it an artist's depiction? Still, I'd rather be more sure, so I'll send the CAIS-SOAS an email about it. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 19:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

== The name ==

I added this to the article:
:The realtionship between the name &quot;;Cyrus&quot; and the word &quot;sun&quot; is also stated by the ancient historians Ctesias and Plutarch. However, some modern historians prefer interpretartions as &quot;young&quot; or &quot;humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest&quot;.

And I cited my source: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/hakhamaneshian/Cyrus-the-great/Cyrus/cyrus_name.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; (also aviable at the Enciclopaedia Iranica wbsite: http://www.iranica.com ), an article by Rudiger Schmidt in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]. ''Enciclopaedia Iranica'' is a respected publication of [[Columbia University]], and Schmidt is a respected scholar on Iranian language. He is also cited in the article [[Iranian languages]]. Then, I see no reason to delete my addition. If someone doesn't think so, please, discuss it here before deleting. I belive we can get a consensus. Remember that we shouldn't give only one view if we want to follow the [[NPOV]] policy. --[[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] 18:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:Yes, I have to apologize for that. After I got into my argument with Spahbod, I completely forgot to mention to you why I did that. And now, I no longer remember. I'll just clean it up, though. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 18:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
::You just changed it again, and I reverted it. The way it is now is proper, and there's no need to change the wording to something a lot more ambiguous. And we use cite Schmitt because we are using Iranica as the reference, which in turn names Hoffmann as the origin of the idea. Also, in the future, please check your links; the link to [[Karl Hoffmann]] is in fact a disambiguation page, &lt;strike&gt;which doesn't even list the aforementioned person.&lt;/strike&gt; (I see you added him; please accept my apology. However, it is still a disambiguation page.) Wikipedia tries to avoid linking to disambiguation pages. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 00:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

SG wrote: ''The way it is now is proper''. I believe the word you are looking for is: ''in my opinion'' or ''i think'' or ''i beleive'' its proper. You don't go around teling people whats proper and whats not. Like i mentioned before everyone has the right to edit, this article does not belong to you nor anyone else. Noticing that my uploaded images had improper license then reporting them all over wikipedia does not mean you have the right to tell people whats proper. I see you reverted the image to be in line with the headline instead of introduction. As i mentioned before ''the &quot;least&quot; you could do is to look at all other articles in wikipedia and see the &quot;proper&quot; place of images''. I am busy with other things right now, but i will be back to edit this article later, i hope you will be more cooperative than you were before.

:Wow, would you mind relaxing a bit? You have no need to be so hostile all the time. Bringing in the completely irrelevant topic of the image copyright problems into this discussion was rather inane. Honestly, I was even about to come to your talk page and apologize for before, as well as note that I uploaded some alternative images that you might be interested in. I don't think I'll be heading that way, now.
:It is implied that &quot;the way it is now is proper&quot; is my opinion; how can it be someone else's opinion? [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 02:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Hostile? irrelevant copyright? it is impied that ...? :) I really do not know what you are talking about, the post above was a reminder that your incivil behavior will not be tolerated, and if you want this to go easy you have to cooperate with other editors when they edit this article, please keep that in mind.

And again keep in mind that speaking like this: ''the way it is now is proper'', is not civil. Other editors that wants to edit artices you have worked on are not your enemies.

1) [[Ctesias]] and [[Plutarch]] didn't know that &quot;khour&quot; means &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;vash&quot; is a sufix of likeness. They only knew that the name &quot;Cyrus&quot; was somehow related with the persian word of &quot;sun&quot; (they even didn't know, or at least didn't tell it, how to say &quot;sun&quot; in persian!). 2) Hoffmann doesn't suggest &quot;humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest&quot; as a transation for &quot;khur&quot;, he gives it as a translation os &quot;Kurus&quot;, the entire name. 3) I think we should write &quot;Hoffmann (cited by R Schmitt)&quot; or &quot;Hoffmann (followed by R Schmitt)&quot;. I think is better to give first the original proposer of the translation (Hoffmann), instead of someone (Schmitt) who is just citing his source. 4) Excuse me if my English is not completely accurate. If my additions are not so clearly expressed / have ortographical or gramatical errors, feel free to correct it. --[[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] 21:15, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

:::Someone who can actually explain his issues clearly! Amizzoni, you have my sincere apology, and I appreciate your lightheartedness about it. However, in response to #1, doing a quick search brings up that Greek and modern sources note the meaning/translation of ''khur'', ''khor'' (or other variations) as &quot;sun.&quot; The entire name is translated as &quot;like the sun,&quot; ''Khor -vash'' inverted. I've changed the wording again; how do you feel about it now? [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 02:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

::The Plutarch refrence is -as I can read in the Encyclopedia Iranica article- &quot;Live of Artoxerxes&quot; 1. 3: &quot;Cyrus {the Younger} took his name of the ancient Cyrus, as he, they say, had his from the sun, which, in the Persian language, is called Cyrus.&quot; (quoted from Dryden's translation [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/artaxerx.html]). The Ctesias refernce is [[Photius]] epitome of &quot;Persica&quot; 52: &quot;After his accession she bore him another son, called Cyrus {[[Cyrus the Younger]]} from the sun.&quot; (quoted from Freese translation [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_03bibliotheca.htm]). In the refrnce you give, Suren Pahlav writes: &quot;His name &quot;Cyrus&quot; (a transliteration of the Greek Kυρoς) is the Greek version of the Persian Koroush or Khorvash meaning: &quot;Like the sun&quot; in Persian khour means &quot;sun&quot; and vash is a suffix of similarity.&quot; Then, nowhere is said that Plutarch and Ctesias &quot;gave its meaning as &quot;like the sun,&quot;&quot; They only knew that &quot;Cyrus&quot; was somehaw related with the persian word for sun. The rest, is not told by them. --[[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] 21:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Oh, I see. I had not been looking at the right sources. I'm trying to write this in a way that fits the context of the rest of the paragraph, so hopefully now it's more acceptable. I think now you'll find it better. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 00:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
some scholars  like abayev ,an ossetian iranologist believes that the word is probably derived from koros that means son[boy],even now in persian kore mean boy child,and interestingly we can see in greek word diocorous that means son of the god.[[User:Spitman|Spitman]] 21:56, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

:I have no problem being cooperative with others. I'm sorry that you interpreted my actions as hostile, but rules are rules, and images need to be tagged properly.

[[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 00:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

First please read this post again carefully: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cyrus_the_Great&amp;diff=66569983&amp;oldid=66560061]. Yes rules are rules, and if you keep deleting categories, waging revert wars and being incivil you will get blocked, its very simple really. I don't recall saying anything about the image tags, that was an error from my part and has been cleared up with user KwH, and i do appreciate your search to find copies of them in the web, you saved KwH's time.
However i see that you from telling user Amizzoni whats proper and not and reverting his changes, has been improving your behavior and did apologize to him, and did not revert his sourced material, that is what being cooperative: [[Wiktionary:Cooperative]] means, and i am glad you finally decided to work with him.

Regarding your reverts on my last changes, lets say achaemenid empire is a subcat, what gives you the right to remove all other cats i added along with that cat?
And the previous images were fine before you changed them, you should explain your changes, not me.
I am sorry but even though you have worked on this article does not mean you own it, i have told you this before, but it seems your ignoring it. I am not being hostile to you nor am i your enemy, so i advice you to be cooperative, do not delete categories, do not delete sourced material and do not tell people whats proper. Consider this a mild warning, i will not be so nice next time you delete categories and such.

:You've threatened me many times about being blocked, and I've yet to see anything emerge. I suggest you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_the_Great&amp;action=history read the page history] and look at the reason for my edit. And we don't &quot;say Achaemenid empire is a subcat&quot; &amp;ndash; it IS a subcat, therefore ONLY the subcat needs to be added, that's how MediaWiki works.[[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 02:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

==Good Article==

[[Cyrus the Great]] is a good article because:
*It is broad
*It is neutral
*It is well cited (w/ inline citations)
*It has well-chosen photos

--[[User:GoOdCoNtEnT|GoOdCoNtEnT]] 19:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
:*It is not neutral.
:&quot;The dynasty had been founded by Achaemenes (ca. 700 BC), who was succeeded by his son Teispes of Anshan. Inscriptions indicate that when the latter died, '''two of his sons shared the throne as Cyrus I of Anshan and Ariaramnes of Persia. They were succeeded by their respective sons Cambyses I of Anshan and Arsames of Persia.'''&quot; Many scholars think the &quot;inscriptions&quot; mentioned are a fake.

:&quot;the cylinder of Cyrus is widely referred to in modern times as the &quot;first charter of human rights.&quot;&quot;, Why &quot;widely&quot;?

:*It hasn't well-chosen photos. The griffin cames from Persepolis, a city founded by [[Darius I]]. It's later that Cyrus. The farahaver is not attested in the reign of Cyrus, and his zaraostrism is disputed.

:Cyrus the Great is not a good article. --[[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] 21:50, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

::It's taken me a while to respond, but here goes. I'm not sure who the &quot;many scholars&quot; you're referring to are. If you can get some proper referencing for names and reasons of why they believe the inscriptions are fake, then we should most definitely put that in there. (''A note on this, you've made me realize that the current sentence needs referencing.'')

::The &quot;widely&quot; in the cylinder sentence has been changed to &quot;often.&quot;

::While the griffin photo itself was taken in Persepolis, I was using it to replace another unfree image of a griffin. If I'm not mistaken, griffins were symbols of the Achaemenid Empire as a whole, but they were more popular during and after Darius the Great's reign.

::Lastly, the article never mentions whether or not Cyrus himself was a Zoroastrian, I know this is disputed. However, he was at the very least influenced by Zoroastrianism. For example, had Zoroastrianism not been promoted to some extent by Cyrus, I find it hard to believe that the Jewish faith itself would have been influenced by Zoroastrianism on its own. Most sources seem to note that Zoroastrianism became the official religion of sorts under Cyrus' reign, but they don't clarify whether or not he himself was a major follower (Darius, for example, was a clear follower, but some other inscriptions note that he paid respect to other religions, such as polytheistic ones). For some sources:

::*&lt;small&gt;Moulton, James Hope, ''Early Zoroastrianism'', ISBN 1417974001.&lt;/small&gt; This book details the difficulty of finding out Cyrus' religious beliefs, and further details on Darius.
::*&lt;small&gt;Boyce, Mary, ''Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism'', ISBN 0226069303.&lt;/small&gt; This one shows that Cyrus made Zoroastrianism the &quot;Iranian religion.&quot;
::*&lt;small&gt;Nigosian, Solomon A., ''The Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research'', ISBN 077351144X.&lt;/small&gt; This book notes that at least one Fire Temple was built during Cyrus' reign.

:::moreover, extremely important things are not allwed to be copied and duplicated for trivial reasons. i would be more surprised if the cyrus cylinder was similar to other things. it should stand out as it has.

== Assessment ==

This is the current critic at Assessement for the A-class:
''The last paragraphs of the conquest of Lydia should be reveised to correct the Pactyes/Pactyas mix up, wich is hte real one or are they two different people. Also in the prior paragraph the pointform of Cyrus' conquest of Croesus should be worked over. As well, why is it mentionned &quot;including Syria and Palestine&quot;, their modern names, while the rest of the article speaks of the states and territories' names as known then? Lastly the map should be moved higher in the article, due to all the movements and cities mentioned (If possible indicating these cities would be appeaciated)'' Could anyone here look to implementing the changes? --[[User:Dryzen|Dryzen]] 15:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== [[Cultural depictions of Cyrus the Great]] ==

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on ''in popular culture'' information.  I started that last year while I raised [[Joan of Arc]] to [[WP:FA|featured article]] when I created [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]], which has become a [[WP:FL|featured list]].  Recently I also created [[Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great]] out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.

== Fraudulent translation of Cyrus Cylinder ==

The link I have removed refers to an incorrect translation of the Cyrus Cylinder. A correct translation can be found [http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/meso/cyrus.html here]. The translation that I removed, contained sections that are not included in the origin. The falsification is well-known, was probably made by Iranian refugees wanted to create a secular hero for Iran, and was discussed at [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Iranica-L/message/1930 Iranica-L] (registration required).

The most recent edition of the Cyrus cylinder is in: Hanspeter Schaudig, ''Die Inschriften Nabonids von Babylon und Kyros' des Grossen samt den in ihrem Umfeld entstandenen Tendenzschriften''. (Ugarit-Verlag, Muenster 2001), 550-556.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Jona Lendering|Jona Lendering]] ([[User talk:Jona Lendering|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jona Lendering|contribs]]) 21:01, November 20, 2006.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

Please do some research before making anymore changes.'''[[User:Mehrshad123|Mehrshad123]] 22:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
::Mershard (why not offer your full name?): Any translation must now be based on Hanspeter Schaudig, ''Die Inschriften Nabonids van Babylon und Kyros' den Grossen'' (etc). 2001 Ugarit Verlag Münster. This version, nor earlier editions as you can find in Pritchard's ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', contain claims about religious freedom. Translations that do claim that the Cyrus Cylinder was a human rights charter, are quite simply adding elements that are not there. These translations have been made by post-Revolution Iranian refugees who have -for reasons I can to some extent understand- tried to show that Iran was once a civil society; but keeping up the Shah's ideas, and creating fake translations, has nothing to do with the real Cyrus.
::As to your advise that I must study the subject: funny that you bring up to subject. I published several books on the ancient Near East.

== &quot;the great&quot; ==

The section I removed is not based on any Achaemenid royal inscription; I have put them online [http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/inscriptions.html here]. Like all oriental rulers from Sumerian times on, Cyrus has the title of &quot;great king&quot;, that's all - nothing special. The first ruler to receive the surname &quot;the great&quot; was probably Antiochus III or -almost just as likely- Alexander III of Macedonia.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Jona Lendering|Jona Lendering]] ([[User talk:Jona Lendering|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jona Lendering|contribs]]) 21:19, November 20, 2006.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Cyrus and Zoroastrianism ==

There used to be a period, somewhere at the mid-twentieth century, in which it was believed that monotheism was preached by Zarathustra, and that these teachings became popular in Iran during the age of Darius. There may be an element of truth in this, but there are several reconsiderations.
* There is no direct evidence - we simply have no texts in Persian from the age of Cyrus because the script was invented by Darius;
* The only Babylonian text (the Cyrus Cylinder) is polytheistic;
* No serious scholar maintains that Zoroastrianism was the sole religion of Iran. There is strong evidence for religious pluriformity (e.g., the Zoroastrian burial practice -exposure- was not used by the Achaemenid kings) and the idea that one nation must have one religion is, of course, nice for a tyranny, which Cyrus did not establish. (Cf. the Christian religions, which have the same God, scripture, etc, but are completely different. Likewise, the fact that Darius mentions Ahuramazda does not make him a Zoroastrian.)

Finally, it must be noted that the idea that Zarathustra was important, was created in Germany to show that not the Jews, but an Aryan nation had invented monotheism. This of course does not mean that it was not an Iranian invention, but must make us skeptical

**Point taken on Cyrus, Darius and Zoroastrianism, but attributing the Prophet Zarathushtra's importance, to the machinations of German Aryan ideology is, itself, a little offensive and disingenuous. Quite a few Parsis, Zoroastrian scholars, and comparative religion students might have a bone of contention there. I know it's a valid point. But a lop-sided one nonetheless, worthy of debate elsewhere - since many Zoroastrian ideas did seem to find their way into the Judeo-Christian tradition. Monotheism (or henotheism, et al.) was probably a contemporary development of both Jews and Zarathushtra, I'm not arguing with that. Anyway, off topic. I agree with the Cyrus point. There is no evidence for it. Although, I would not say that because they were not put in dakhmas (Towers of Silence) proves anything either. Rulers have a habit of following their own rules. Constantine wasn't exactly the model Christian, etc. I would say there is inconclusive evidence either way, and I myself, lean towards the theory that he wasn't an orthodox Zarathushtri Mazdayasnian by any means.

== Caption Wrong: Image:Cyrus II le Grand et les Hébreux.jpg ==

The current caption of the image, Cyrus II le Grand et les Hébreux.jpg, states, &quot;Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Hebrew pilgrims to resettle and rebuild Jerusalem, earning him an honored place in Judaism.&quot; I believe this is in error for two reasons: 

1) The Hebrews in question were not pilgrims; they were captives. A pilgrim makes his travels at his own will, on his journey to a destination (usually for relgious reasons). The Hebrews were captives, forcibly removed from Palestine by foreign armies. 

2) The decree of Cyrus only allowed the Hebrews to rebuild their temple, not the city. A different king gave the Hebrews permission to rebuild their city. 

I will wait a week before I make a change to the caption of the image, unless someone presents an objection before then. [[User:Pooua|Pooua]] 23:30, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

:You are correct; in fact, the article text itself supports your statement. I've updated the caption per your suggestions, but with one difference.

:If I am not mistaken, Cyrus did actually allow them to go back and rebuild the city, not just the temple. However, Ezra, who maintained the city after the Jews returned to Jerusalem, only managed to finish the temple; one can only assume that he was occupied with other issues. Nehemiah, the governor of Judea after Ezra, was the one who essentially rebuilt the city. He didn't need more permission to do so, as Ezra already had authorization.

== Cylinder ==

''However, it can be argued that the cylinder decrees the normal themes of Near-Eastern rule: respect for the gods of all peoples, just and peaceful rule, and the power and glory of the empire. By this argument, pointed out by several scholars&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuhrt &quot;The Cyrus Cylinder and Achaemenid imperial policy&quot; in ''Journal of Studies of the Old Testament'' 25 pp. 83-97, B. van der Spek, &quot;Did Cyrus the Great introduce a new policy towards subdued nations? Cyrus in Assyrian perspective&quot; in ''Persica'' 10 pp. 273-285; it is also followed by M. Dandamaev ''A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire'', pp. 52-53, and {{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html |title=Cyrus Cylinder |accessdate=2006-12-29 |author=Lendering, Jona |authorlink=Jona Lendering |date=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cyrus may have been unusually generous, but the cylinder cannot be regarded as a charter of human rights.''

1- Please stop adding 3 references in to one, there is no need. The Lendering page is not academic. The other two can be discussed.

2- Many Assyrian kings are known to have destroyed temples of kingdoms and boast about it in their inscriptions, e.g. &quot;'''The Babylonian Chronicle retells how Egypt &quot;was sacked and its gods were abducted&quot; (ABC 1 Col.4:25)'''&quot;, also &quot;''I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds''&quot; (Ashurbanipal).

So how can this cylinder have the ''normal theme'' of decrees of near eastern rulers?! --[[User:Rayis|Rayis]] 11:17, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
: As to #1: I propose a reference to &quot;Schaudig (title) and Van der Spek (title)&quot; to which may or may not be added something like &quot;summarized, in collaboration with S and VDS, by L&quot;.
: As to #2: Perhaps &quot;many of the normal themes&quot; (i.e., &quot;respect for the gods of all peoples, just and peaceful rule, and the power and glory of the empire&quot;) is a better phrasing?

I can understand the removal of the homa griffin, though [[Talk:Cyrus_the_Great#Good_Article|I have argued this before]], and the image was kept. But Croesus, why would that be deleted?

Now, as for the tomb image, I'm not sure. I like the fact that it is a more whole photo of the tomb, but the one we had previously had two greater aspects to it: a much higher resolution and the people in the photograph served as a measurement; looking at the current image, I can't really see how massive the tomb is.

The relief photo is a bit better, since it allows us to actually see it in more detail due to the shadows. I think it needs a crop and color balance adjustment, but I'll get to that later. [[User:SG|♠ SG]] [[User talk:SG|→Talk]] 19:56, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

I find Cyrus Kar's [http://spentaproductions.com/300themovie_the_truth_behind_300.htm view on the Battle of Thermopylae] to be rather extreme, comparing Leonidas and the Spartans to bin Laden. He has provided no sources for his arguments, as if pulling them straight out of thin air.

== Achaemenidian? ==

As it now reads, the article can easily be read to say that Cyrus is an Achaemenidian.  How-ever, see Rollinger 2007 (http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2007/2007-02-46.html#n3): &quot;Cyrus and Cambyses I are Teispids and should not be confused with the Achaemenids of Darius' line.

:Achaemenid or Achaemenian, but not Achaemenidian! :P Yes, and see also M. Waters, &quot;Cyrus and the Achaemenids&quot;, ''Iran'' 42 (2004), in http://www.achemenet.com/ (&gt; ressources &gt; sous presse); he gives more references in note 6.

== &quot;The largest nation the world had yet seen&quot; is potentially misleading. ==

The end of the first paragraph claims that &quot;The empire expanded under his rule, eventually conquering most of Southwest Asia, much of Central Asia, and up to the Indus River, to create the largest nation the world had yet seen&quot; and a source is cited. http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus.html . However, this statement has two issues:

1. The cited source makes no such claim. A broad claim like this needs a strong citation, as this kind of superlative language (&quot;the biggest&quot;, &quot;one of the most...&quot; etc) is used flippantly around here and ultimately makes these articles devoid of meaning. I'm not saying the Persian empire wasn't the largest the world had yet seen, but that there has to be a valid source for this claim. The source does back up the statement about the regions that were conquered, but it makes no comment about the overall size of the resulting empire.

2. It is a stretch to call the ancient Persia empire a &quot;nation.&quot; The nation itself would've been where Cyrus came from, but I think most people would agree that conquered territories aren't instantly assimilated into the &quot;nation.&quot; Nation has more to do with cultural and linguistic regions than political boundaries.

And doing a quick web search, I see that people are not much reluctant to call it Cyrus' capital or Cyrus' residence [http://books.google.com/books?id=vRR8dfI7j_kC&amp;pg=RA1-PA838&amp;ots=tfNzb5r3WI&amp;dq=pasargadae&amp;sig=KGCbCQt6arIP1hmMbZeGkeiKYwI#PRA1-PA838,M1]  [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f5/v6f5a026.html] .

:::You are comparing chapter 20 of a book to the lead of an encyclopedia entry. It absolutely deserves mention that he commissioned Pasargadae (and possibly Persepolis) to be built during his lifetime, and that Pasargadae, while under construction, became the capital of his new empire some time after his reign began. However, not in the lead. It seems to me that we're just trying to pack too much information into the introduction, whereas details like this could be used to expand the rest of the article.

== Death edits ==

&quot;Vengeance&quot; was not a referenced motive by historians for Cyrus' attack against the Massagetae.  It was expansionism typical of his career.  Vengeance was, however, a major motive for Tomyris' retaliation against Cyrus.

The site popularly known as the tomb of Cyrus is not definitively accepted as the actual site where he was interred, and indication of that is now given.

The term &quot;regnal years&quot; regarding cuneiform needs somekind of explanation, reference, or wikilink on the subject.  As it stood, it was a term with no context and made little apparent sense by itself.

The death section uses numbers 26 and 27 as citations.  I have removed statements which are not supported by those citations or the Tomyris article, with the exception of 26 and its statement about Croesius' advice.  The source doesn't illustrate the claim that Croesius advised Cyrus to advance into the territory of the Massagetae.  It states the opposite--that Cyrus was advised by Croesius ''against'' entering their territory and did so anyway, and I have re-written that statement to accurately reflect what the source does mention of it, instead of removing it.

I added a bit more detail about the battles with the Massagetae.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.58.152.55|75.58.152.55]] ([[User talk:75.58.152.55|talk]]) 02:37, 14 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Classical period ==

The use of the term Classical period is a bit confusing.  Presumably, this refers to the Classical period of Greek history, which from the outset is a somewhat chauvinist framework within which to discuss Persian history.  Moreover, it is incorrect to say that Cyrus was active in the Classical period, since the sixth century is traditionally regarded by Greek historians as a part of the Archaic period (ending with the invasion of Greece conducted by Xerxes in 480/479).

Ariobarza talk says that this is a excerpt from the article [[Basileus]] which is a copy pasted here, and says...

'''Use of Basileus in Classical Times'''

In classical times, almost all states had abolished the hereditary royal office in favor of democratic or oligarchic rule: Some exceptions exist: namely the two hereditary Kings of Sparta (who served as joint commanders of the army, and were also called arkhagetai), the Kings of Macedon and of the Molossians in Epirus, various kings of &quot;barbaric&quot; (i.e. non-Greek) tribes in Thrace and Illyria, as well as the Achaemenid kings of Persia. The Persian king was also referred to as Megas Basileus (Great King) or Basileus Basileōn, a translation of the Persian title Šāhanšāh (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), or simply &quot;the king&quot;.

==GA Sweeps==
This article has been reviewed as part of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force]] in an effort to ensure all listed Good articles continue to meet the [[WP:WIAGA|Good article criteria]]. In reviewing the article, I have found there are many issues that need to be addressed.
*In short, this article has serious problems. Parts, like legacy etc. are well sourced while others, like this whole dam business seem to be copyright violations from some website, so badly have they been incorporated. Much of the article is poorly written. In the legacy section for example, which is one of the best parts of the article, Thomas Jefferson is brought up twice in two seperate paragraphs which make the same comment. In order for this to remain a GA, I will need to see a real commitment from somebody to deal with these problems, beginning by exorcising this strange section on the dam and replacing it with reasonable and sourced prose. If anyone is willing please indicate below and I will work with you to straighten out the problems.
*The biography section needs close attention because at the moment it is just a collection of short, frequently unconnected paragraphs, and in places lacks vital sourcing. 
*Find an image to go in the infobox.

I will check back in no less than seven days. If progress is being made and issues are being addressed, the article will remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. Otherwise, it may be delisted (such a decision may be challenged through [[WP:GAR]]). If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at [[WP:GAN]].

I do not know how to make big light blue quotation marks, so sorry, I'm new here, been doing other things.

So I did 2 of 3 things, and I want you to send your pleading message to all those guys intrested in Cyrus, so the pros can know about this articles mishaps, also  I will one day soon put some information pertaining to the views of Ctesias, and Nicolas, Xenophon, which have the right to be heard, I mean their accounts of Cyrus that are very similar to Herodotus's versions, so they have some truth to it.

Cyrus was also King of Anshan. It is in fact his most attested title.

AFAIK means &quot;as far as I know&quot;. I paste here your comments on [[basileus]] (from my talk page):

&quot;Ariobarza talk also says that this is a excerpt from the article Basileus which is a copy pasted here, and says...

Use of Basileus in Classical Times

In classical times, almost all states had abolished the hereditary royal office in favor of democratic or oligarchic rule: Some exceptions exist: namely the two hereditary Kings of Sparta (who served as joint commanders of the army, and were also called arkhagetai), the Kings of Macedon and of the Molossians in Epirus, various kings of &quot;barbaric&quot; (i.e. non-Greek) tribes in Thrace and Illyria, as well as the Achaemenid kings of Persia. The Persian king was also referred to as Megas Basileus (Great King) or Basileus Basileōn, a translation of the Persian title Šāhanšāh (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), or simply &quot;the king&quot;.

None Greeks calling none Greek kings the title of Basileus? What the hell, I thought...Oh, and don't forget that Byzantium rulers of turkey in nearby Lydia used them to, even for foreign conquerors, and that Thrace was sometimes changed in locations between Greece and Turkey, and that the eastern half of ancient Thrace belongs to Turkey today, so don't say it only applied to Persian Satraps in Thrace, which anyways Thracians and Persians are none Greeks themselves, it was applied wherever the majority of the population was Greek, I guess, because I think this seems to be the case here, or the lands between Greece and Turkey. Which included ancient Lydia, which Cyrus conquered. Also we have a considerable amount of information that Ctesias has left us, basically based on the fragments of Ctesias, Herodotus talks about the Persians five times more than Ctesias talks about the Persians, and both Ctesias and Herodotus mention eachother, which shows both the (Persica), and (Histories), were written around the same time, which is very similar to Herodotus accounts too. So I think there is some truth to it, in the middle of course. Which is still worth mentioning, you can find it, and read it, and you'll be suprised, in books, and on the internet. Another reason is that Ctesias, as verified by other historians was the personal physician of Artaxerxes, and had access to the Persian archives. So is it not common sense, to believe in the words of a royal Persian physician, or to believe in the words of a commoner in some ancient town, meaning Herodotus!. To give an EXAMPLE, imagine a Assyrian tablet saying king Whatever killed Tedo, but the tablet dosen't say when he buried Tedo. Then a Babylonian tablet both dated in the same time, says that in July 2, 1,234 BC, king Whatever buried Tedo, now we have the date, because the Babylonians have told us this, and there is no reason to doubt them, because, like I said both tablets were dated around the same time, and lets say they were written by prominent historians, (and again this is an example), SO the point is, (by using more than one source to find something out, we come closer to the truth), both Ctesias fills in the gaps that Herodotus leaves open, and Herodotus does the same thing to Ctesias. So as I read in most books, historians do this today. Okay then, thanks for reading, goodbye.&quot;

&quot;I really respect your work, but I got to say I'm just dissapointed at your recent edits, YES imperial status of Media is disputed, but compare it to Assyria and Egypt, it was a huge KINGDOM? Or an {E M P I R E}, so the Cyrus article is just an educated guess on it, because to tell you the truth were never going to know. And Cyrus first conquered Lydia, so if the Persian kings after him were called Basileus (as my last comment implies), then he was most likely the first of the Persian kings to be called that, thank you!--67.180.225.250 (talk) 08:46, 12 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk&quot;



I find it hard to understand what you are trying to mean, it really doesn't make much sense to me. 

*On Emperor of Media vs. King of Media: no, the Median kings never called themselves &quot;Emperor&quot;, the word comes from Latin ([[imperator]]) and there has not yet been found any written source of the Medes themselves.
*On Basileus of Lydia: &quot;so if the Persian kings after him were called Basileus (as my last comment implies), then he was most likely the first of the Persian kings to be called that.&quot; The Persian kings, as all kings, were called basileus by the Greeks: basileus is the Greek word for king. It is not a title the Persian kings used, but a way the Greeks called them. Futhermore, they had no title related in any way with Lydia, as far as we know from the evidence available.
*On King of Neo-Babylonia: So you admit that his title was King of Babylonia. Remember that caption is about titles, not about the places where he ruled. If you click on &quot;edit&quot;, you'll see that this part of the Infobox says: title = , and a little bellow, othertitles = .
*On King of Anshan: Again, the caption is about titles. [[User:Amizzoni|Amizzoni]] ([[User talk:Amizzoni|talk]]) 02:37, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

===EXCUSE THE PERSONAL RESPONDS IN THESE COMMENTS, I WAS RESPONDING TO A FRIEND, BUT I MAKE MY POINTS HERE TOO, SO THANK YOU FOR AVOIDING THEM AND UNDERSTANDING IF YOUR WILLING TO READ IT.===

Salam or Dorood my Persian bro...

Hi, I got to say, thanks for your edits, you have opened my mind. But, there is a problem, me, who has studied the works of Herodotus, the father of historical lies, and Ctesias the lost and very intricate historian that almost all his works were lost, and Xenophon, Nicolas of Damascus, Justin, including Biblical and Babylonian sources... All I can say is that all these historians and history, which the arguement over history itself lets leave for another time, is disputed, all of them, so just because the full work of Ctesias the guy who knew personally as the physician of Artaxerxes, and knew Persian historians, I think people have been biased to Ctesias because almost all his works were lost, and he fills in the holes that Herodotus leaves open, including that he wrote his thing only 200 years after Herodotus' Histories, so to call him unreliable, would be a big mistake. So I just want to say that Cyrus' campgain box that I created is based of a combination of Hero,Ctes, and Nicols works. Which always remember the only way to discover truth in history is to analize all works and average them, by using all sources to find similar things which could be true. The article of Cyrus only has Herodotus' version of events, and that shows that over the ages peoples bias's are expanding, he basically fails us to cover the later events of Cyrus the Greats life. So it is the only way is to include all estimates even if they are not true. Like in certain battles if more than one historian talks about the numbers, you don't just put one of their guesses, you put all the guesses of all the historians who talked about it, to be fair and balanced of course. So Atradates was a nickname of Cambyses I, it's not another person, and therefore I think it now should be included in Cambyses I article, don't worry I won't put it back in Cyrus's article. Second, Baselius or something, I may have spelled it wrong, like you said only applies to Greek rulers right, but in tradition Croesus was a  Semi-Greek, and even if the tradition is wrong, Asia Minor which is half of The Lydian Empire was composed of Asian Greeks! Lydians are Greeks, and so are Ionians, throughout really ancient history they migrated back and forth from mainland Greece to Asian Greece. But when Persia fought, starting from the Ionian Revolt, mainland Greece, the official Greco-started-Persian Wars began, so to make Cyrus's title apply to him, calling him a Baselius is not going to hurt. And the Medes had a Empire with a Emperor, some books today call Astyages Emperor of the Medes, ask me to look for it, and I'll prove it to you. But as we all know Bablyonians had only Kings, which they called themselves, so thanks for reading, and best of wishes to you. Also Herodotus told allot of stories, but Ctesias said facts, now Herodotus is more proned to lie than Ctesias, but Ctesias could have lied to, most of the time they both don't know if even the things they say themselves is true or not, so they could lie without even knowing it. And thanks you. Comment back, and suggest things to me if I'm wrong, remember that I only talk comman sense here, I'm in a unknown school of thought, and I am becoming 19 years of age, and study ancient Persia heavily, and have allot of good books, okay.

Ariobarza talk also says that this is a excerpt from the article Basileus which is a copy pasted here, and says...

Use of Basileus in Classical Times

In classical times, almost all states had abolished the hereditary royal office in favor of democratic or oligarchic rule: Some exceptions exist: namely the two hereditary Kings of Sparta (who served as joint commanders of the army, and were also called arkhagetai), the Kings of Macedon and of the Molossians in Epirus, various kings of &quot;barbaric&quot; (i.e. non-Greek) tribes in Thrace and Illyria, as well as the Achaemenid kings of Persia. The Persian king was also referred to as Megas Basileus (Great King) or Basileus Basileōn, a translation of the Persian title Šāhanšāh (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), or simply &quot;the king&quot;.

None Greeks calling none Greek kings the title of Basileus? What the hell, I thought...Oh, and don't forget that Byzantium rulers of turkey in nearby Lydia used them to, even for foreign conquerors, and that Thrace was sometimes changed in locations between Greece and Turkey, and that the eastern half of ancient Thrace belongs to Turkey today, so don't say it only applied to Persian Satraps in Thrace, which anyways Thracians and Persians are none Greeks themselves, it was applied wherever the majority of the population was Greek, I guess, because I think this seems to be the case here, or the lands between Greece and Turkey. Which included ancient Lydia, which Cyrus conquered. Also we have a considerable amount of information that Ctesias has left us, basically based on the fragments of Ctesias, Herodotus talks about the Persians five times more than Ctesias talks about the Persians, and both Ctesias and Herodotus mention eachother, which shows both the (Persica), and (Histories), were written around the same time, which is very similar to Herodotus accounts too. So I think there is some truth to it, in the middle of course. Which is still worth mentioning, you can find it, and read it, and you'll be suprised, in books, and on the internet. Another reason is that Ctesias, as verified by other historians was the personal physician of Artaxerxes, and had access to the Persian archives. So is it not common sense, to believe in the words of a royal Persian physician, or to believe in the words of a commoner in some ancient town, meaning Herodotus!. To give an EXAMPLE, imagine a Assyrian tablet saying king Whatever killed Tedo, but the tablet dosen't say when he buried Tedo. Then a Babylonian tablet both dated in the same time, says that in July 2, 1,234 BC, king Whatever buried Tedo, now we have the date, because the Babylonians have told us this, and there is no reason to doubt them, because, like I said both tablets were dated around the same time, and lets say they were written by prominent historians, (and again this is an example), SO the point is, (by using more than one source to find something out, we come closer to the truth), both Ctesias fills in the gaps that Herodotus leaves open, and Herodotus does the same thing to Ctesias. So as I read in most books, historians do this today. Okay then, thanks for reading.

I really respect your work, but I got to say I'm just dissapointed at your recent edits, YES imperial status of Media is disputed, but compare it to Assyria and Egypt, it was a huge KINGDOM? Or an {E M P I R E}, so the Cyrus article is just an educated guess on it, because to tell you the truth were never going to know. And Cyrus first conquered Lydia, so if the Persian kings after him were called Basileus (as my last comment implies), then he was most likely the first of the Persian kings to be called that, thank you!
===Shahenshah of Persia===: Ok.
===Emperor of Media===: The imperial status of Media is disputed among scholars, so it would be better to &quot;SAY&quot; &quot;King of Media&quot; instead. REPLY; That is why I PUT a semi-colon on the word Emperor, so if its wrong people know its just a fancy title.] It is important to take into account that the word King doesn't imply that the individual ruled over a small territory, it is used to indicate that he was a sole ruler; by this way, all emperors were kings, so the people who consider Media as an Empire, accept that its emperor was King of Media. REPLY; And also according to some findings, which I WILL site soon, sometimes the rulers of Media called themselves the EMPEROR, and Cyrus was not a ruler of a Kingdom, but an Empire.] Compare the usage of Emperor of Media (4) with the usage of King of Media (2,100). REPLY; In the study of history, it changes over time, as more evidence is discovered and arranged, so basically if the majority of people choose to believe something wrong, does not mean its true.]
===Basileus of Lydia===: Cyrus conquered Lydia, but, AFAIK, there is no evidence that he used any title relating to Lydia. REPLY; PLEASE READ THE LAST HUGE PARAGRAPH I WROTE, AND LOOK AT THE BASILEUS ARTICLE YOURSELF!] It is a dubious and unreferenced statement, so I think we should simply remove it. REPLY; I referenced it on your talk page, and Cyrus' talk page.]
===King of Neo-Babylonia===: Such title doesn't exist, his title was &quot;King of Babylonia&quot;. We shouldn't make up titles. REPLY; Yes, but he conquered the Chaldean or Neo-Babylonian Empire, not the ORIGINAL Babylonian Empire, please type in Neo-Babylonian Empire on Wikipedia.] Cyrus was also King of Anshan. It is in fact his most attested title. REPLY; Yes, but most scholars today consider him just talking about his capitals name, which Tiespes conquered Anshan or Susa from the Elamites, when they were destroyed by Assyria. So if Cyrus says he is the King of Pasargadae, he is the king of his own capital, his capital was later moved to Pasargadae.]

Finally, the Finale!
I'm doing this, as from the begining, to correct the previous versions of the titles of Cyrus, and to match it with Alexander the Greats titles (which I suggest you click on him to see what I mean), in history, there is NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU CLAIM OF EXISTS, UNLESS ITS ARCHAEOLOGICAL. So please do not TALK about EVIDENCE, the only EVIDENCE is a surviving fragment of the historians writings. Also read the USE IN CLASSICAL TIMES part of the Basileus article, even if you have already read it carefully, I beg you the last sentences answers your questions. EVIDENCE OF TITLES for Cyrus is the king of the four corners, as he and the Mesopotaimians cite in his famous stella to himself. Or the former powers that he conquered, IN FACT, by conquering the LYDIAN, NEO-BABYLONIAN OR YOU CAN CALL IT CHALDEAN, AND MEDIAN E M P I R E S, he managed to also conquer the hundreds of smaller types of peoples in them too. So what BOTHERS me is that other than a coin of Alexander saying he is Zeus-Ammon, there is no evidence, just like in Cyrus's case that he had any other titles, we give him titles based on what historians say, SO believe it or not, JUST LIKE CYRUS, he conquered the three to four major powers of his time, (and anyways they should give him a Indian title to, because he also conquered India), Alexander gets the Greek, Hellenstic, Egyptian, and Shahenshah TITLES. But Cyrus only gets half of what he deserves. But, know this, its not that I want to overshadow Alexander or any other great conquerers article, its that I want things to be fair, so if your human, I think you can understand. And Herodotus, Ctesias, and Nicolas of Damascus, all say after the battle of Pasargadae, which Cyrus conquers the Medians, he is praised by both sides, and even referenced by the titles of now being the KING OF PERSIA AND MEDIA, ACCLAMATIONS AND SHOUTING TO HIS FACE! Again ANSHAN is just a capital, that later moved to PASARGADAE! About 75% of historians agree that the Persian realm was all of south-western IRAN, because all the Persian tribes were united as one under Achaemens or Teispes, so Cyrus was not the ruler of just one small city, most suppose that Cyrus may have acknowledged himself (so the Babylonians would know) that his original capital was at ANSHAN, that is why he refers to himself as KING OF ANSHAN AND OF PERSIA, (Persia being the new empire he created). I PRAY to Ahura Mazda, that you can understand my simple to understand sentences that even a five year old can understand. Finally check this mind blowing article out, [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], yes such a name, and possible title for Cyrus can exist. For Medians calling themselves emperor, I'm still searching. But in the mean time, I'll put &quot;Emperor&quot;, but as you can SEE, with SEMI-COLINS AROUND EMPEROR, TO SHOW THAT THIS IS A FANCY TITLE FOR MEDIAN EMPIRE, so people UNDERSTAND it still means king, so DON'T remove it, because I kinda agree with you on the Media subject.

FINALLY, Amizzoni, I agree with you on everything, its just there are some things most people know and don't know, but don't REALIZE! I cheerish and I'm pissed off about the debates that we sometimes have, but I HOPE THIS CAN BE THE LAST ONE!

I am sorry. I know when I write, it sounds like I'm a ten year old, its just I'm in a hurry most of the time for personal reasons, hope you can understand. Also whenever I revert your edits, it is because of AFAIK, I might know more or less for certain things at times. And I'm expecting you to know why I do it, because I leave you those HUGE responses. But, I did not revert your edits last time, someone else added Media and Babylon to it. So again just for YOU to know, Anshan was an Elamite city conquered by Teispes in 645? BC, when the Elamites were weakened by the Assyrians. Then from that time it was considered to be the capital of the Persis province, so Cyrus may have been wanting the Babylonians to know that his birthplace and coronation was in Anshan, that is why he says he is KING OF ANSHAN, AND PERSIA, which is more like KING OF PERSIA, if he was originally from Anshan, then he should have said he is an Elamite, WHICH HE DOES NOT SAY, again the capital was moved to another city, which is Pasargadae, the city where his tribe resided, and the clan of the Achaemedae were, it was also were he beat his so called grandfather Astyages in battle, so to me, and most historians, it is considered as only ONE TITLE, not Anshan and Persia, only PERSIA. So don't be mad at the last edit that did not really change anything, which anyways was not me.

And look at the &quot;other titles&quot; section of [[Cyrus the Great]], and the main title I think should now be Shahensha of Persia, which if you look is most appropiate, I also did not remove anything you put there, only rearanged it, so that is it. I hope you can now agree!
==DATE OF DEATH, AND CITING TITLES==
The last editing for Cyrus titles tells me that I have to cite titles. But why do I have to site other titles, if in the Cyrus article it says he conquered the median, lydian, babylonian empires? So Cyrus is never going to have these titles, even in the other titles, these were independent and largest empires of that time, so he had to have the titles. Also from the babylonian tablet other than him being king of Anshan, Persia, Media, he says he is the king of Babylonia, so I don't need to cite anything its to obvious, and the small numbers by the titles, will make this article to silly and intricate, as other articles are not like this, anyways for Lydia it was at the time the 4th largest empire, so I think it is safe to assume he had a title for that, almost no historians doubt it. And I found this on the cyrus article of 1911encyclopaedia.org site, which says, (His death occurred in 528 B.C., as we have a Babylonian tablet from the Adar of the tenth year of Cyrus, i.e. February 528; for in Babylon the first year of Cyrus began in the spring of 538.) I'm not sure if this is true, I always thought he died either mid-August 530 or 529 B.C. So if anyone wants to verify it, please go ahead and comment here or on my page, or both, goodbye.--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 06:29, 18 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

:No, you need reliable sources that he actually used any title you want to cite. 'Safe to assume' won't do. What 'other articles' do is immaterial, they may need fixing.

[[User:Dougweller|Doug Weller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 18:16, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

I think it is not necessary to give the entire titulature above the image, see for instance [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Perhaps we should create a new section on his titles with all the details. I think &quot;King of Persia, King of Anshan, King of Babylon&quot; would be OK for the infobox. Or perhaps we should include King of Media too, and say Shahenshah of Persia instead of King of Persia. My reasons are the following:
*King of Anshan: He uses it in an inscription from [[Ur]] and in the Cyrus Cylinder.
*King of Babylon: He uses it in the Cyrus Cylinder Doug quotes, and he is called so in Babylonian documents. King of Neo-Babylonia is not a title, it was made up by Ariobarza.
*King of Persia, or Great King of Persia, of even Shahenshah if you prefer: He is called so in by the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] (king of Parsu) and by Greek authors. It is agreed among scholars that he was king of Persia (although DT Potts called it into question in a recent article published in ''Birth of the Persian Empire''; I think his view is not at all mainstream). The problem with Shahanshah (King of Kings) is that it is Modern Persian; in Old Persian it was rendered xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām. Furthermore, xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām is only attested since [[Darius I]].
*King of Media: Herodotus, Ctesias and Xenophon says he took the throne of Media. I don't know what happened in Cyrus' times, but I'm quite sure that Xerxes is called King of Persia and Media in Babylonian documents, so it is a real title that the Persian kings used (I mean, it wasn't made up by Ariobarza). The problem is that I'm unable to find any academic book or article calling Cyrus &quot;King of Media&quot; or discussing the matter (in fact I haven't searched a lot).
*Basileus of Lydia, or King of Lydia: Cyrus never used such title. No Greek author calls him so, no source of any kind calls him so, no scholar argued that he used such title. The title &quot;King of Lydia&quot; disappeared with Croesus' dethronement. As far as I know, of course, but in any case Ariobarza must provide an academic reference.

:  &quot;Medism: The Origin and Significance of the Term&quot; by David F. ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 104, (1984), pp. 15-30&quot;Although the simple title 'king of Media' does not appear in the Achaemenid royal inscriptions, there is substantial evidence that Cyrus also adopted the standard royal formulae of the Median kings after his defeat of Astyages in 550. Several years later, in the Harran inscriptions of king Nabonidus of Babylon, Cyrus is depicted as the legitimate successor to the Median throne. These texts indicate that the Babylonian monarch received ambassadors from the 'king of Egypt, the city of the Medes, and the land of the Arabs'.46 The strange expression, 'the city of the Medes', has been assigned to the period 'immediately after the victory of Cyrus, who had perhaps not secured or assumed his official titles',47 but it can more plausibly be dated after the I3th year of the reign of Nabonidus, i.e. between 543 and 539.48 'The city of the Medes' then seems obviously to refer to the Median capital of Ecbatana, the political center of Cyrus' regime or a synecdoche for the entire Median kingdom.&quot;[[User:Dougweller|Doug Weller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 14:50, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

==Lydia Title==
Hi, I was wondering why you keep removing Cyrus the Great title of king of lydia. As you know Cyrus conquered three major Empires during his reign, the median, lydian, and babylonian EMPIRES, NOT SOME INSIGNIFIGANT SMALLER KINGDOMS, like Armenia or Cappadocia, these where all independent. So as cited various times in history books, the article, and historical fragments he conquered lydia the same why as he conquered  media or babylon but, for some reason, to YOUR exception he does not deserve the title, EVENTHOUGH, the Persian kings right after him still held the title [[Basileus]] of Lydia, eventhough the Lydians or Persians where not Greeks, this is due to the fact that the Lydian culture was modeled after the Greeks! So if he was the  first Persian king who conquered Lydia, shouldn't he be the first to have the title BASILEUS? Or if thats to extremist for this user, than at least KING should do, EVENTHOUGH, (basileus translated to persian is shahensha which still means ruler or king!) thank you, goodbye. (Sorry for the confrontational langauge, I was in a hurry), BY THE WAY SHAHENSHA STILL MEANS KING SO PLEASE DO NOT REPLACE IT WITH KING OF PERSIA, THEY MEAN THE SAME THING! For Ruler of Anshan, Anshan was a small city of belonging to the small petty kingdom of Elam, which the Persians took, so look at the article of [[List of rulers of Bithynia]], notice it says ''ruler of'', they were still kings, but for cities, they say RULER.--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 04:04, 20 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

===For Basileus of Lydia===
From google.com go to books, and type in cyrus the great as basileus. NOTE TO READER: Eventhough hundreds of sources were found, sources relating Cyrus the Great and his title was limited, but none the less should prove that the only way he could have been basileus, if he was closest to Greece, which the closest EMPIRE was that of the Lydians, which were not a mere province but an EMPIRE controling 1/3 of Turkey. And in the [[Basileus]] article which specifically says Persian kings were called basileus by greeks, which means they did not have to be Greek to have such a name, and the Ionians that Cyrus conquered were Greeks, and may have bitterly called him basileus.

First, for some reason, King of Media is up there with his titles, so confirmation of titles for Media and Lydia only appear in Greek historians accounts of when he was alive, and Media is still up there!? We keep it because we know he conquered it. But for Lydia it should not be a mystery, because it was a empire he conquered. Second, the persian kings at Lydia that lived after him were called basileus, and they did not conquer Lydia, so who conquered Lydia first? CYRUS THE GREAT, this should be common sense. And it is not my fault the author gave a wrong quote from Xenophon.

===Now, for King of Lydia===
NOTE TO READER: As already acknowledged, Basilues means king. So, is there any shred of historical evidence that the kings of Lydia were called and or gave themselves the title of basileus in the first place? And did Cyrus let Croesus keep his title? Another thing, just because we have not FOUND evidence of Cyrus as basileus written down, does not mean he was not, and Lydian coins minted in his time should call him king, like all other Persian coins do, so I am also doing research on that.

It's not known if it refers to Croesus, but the other ruler could have been of Cilicia, which is unlikely because cyrus never fought him in battle, which the tablet implies he fought the ruler first, which only man could have been Croesus that Cyrus killed, and thus took the title, because in Herodotus version it says Croesus' son and hire to the throne was accidently killed,(Which is the only possible reason the tablet is refering to) or Cyrus may have actually killed Croesus, so it's a barely a mystery, and Cyrus spares Croesus in Herodotus' version, and Ctesias' version, also Ctesias says Cyrus relocated Croesus, and made him satrap(therefore taking his title away) of the Choromithrenia province, which the capital of the province was Barene, near Ecbatana, the capital of the Median province. Also the only way the Persians could have attained the title of Basileus is that the former king was descended from a Greek, or a Greek king ruling in a Asian state, or as it means king could have applied it anyone, if the population or culture did not mind it.

Seriously, as there is another 1.5 way to go in the results, I am getting tired, I have proven that Lydia used the title of Basileus(Whether or not his king was of Greek descent or not, which can forever be debated) which does not matter because he did call himself Basileus, anyways I have also proven that Croesus was called and called himself Basileus, and that while his son and hire died, becaue of Cyrus' invasion, and even if Croesus did not self execute or was not executed, scholars and historians agree that he became a satrap, and Ctesias says he was satrap in the city of Barene that I already explained above. Lastly even if Lydia got a Persian satrap, which it did, it would not take the Basileus title away from Cyrus, because Cyrus appointed a satrap for Media, and Babylon, BUT still he kept his title for them. And it is so obvious, that scholars in books don't even attempt to name him Basileus of Lydia, (but King of Lydia they do call him, which I am finding more and more in books, which I will copy paste more books with that here soon, for now I have no time, and must depart) because it's virtually implied, and not straightforwardly stated everywhere! The FACT is his main conquests, not the minor ones, was that he conquered the MEDIAN, LYDIAN, AND BABYLONIAN EMPIREs, THEREFORE HE IS THE KING OF MEDIA, KING OF LYDIA, KING OF BABYLON, OR BASILEUS FOR LYDIA, (same thing!), WHETHER ANYONE LIKES IT OR NOT. And Anshan is just a Elamite city conquered by Persians before Cyrus, so KING OF ANSHAN is said to the Babylonians to make them know that he was born and ascended to the throne there, so its just a city and Cyrus says it himself. Also the city of Pasargadae, home of that certain Persian tribe containing the clan of the Achaemenids existed before Cyrus built a bigger city there to comemorate his victory over Astyages there. And Anshan was not an independent kingdom to have it's OWN TITLE! So finally, If anyone agrees or STILL does not agree with me, after multitudes of evidence supplied here, please have a dam* good explanation here! Finally, thank you for reading, and goodbye.--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 13:34, 23 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

==Croesus, the last king of Lydia==
Please stop the insults. You have shown no sources that say he used the title King of Lydia. It is easy to find sources about who the last king of Lydia was. You have not found a source that says he ever used the title King of Lydia, and that is what you need. All the sources I have read do not give him that title and say that Croesus was the last King of Lydia.

==um==
DA one of my sources says the [king of persia was always BASILEUS] to the greeks of europe and asia too, even when alive, kings of Lydia were also called BASILEUS, last king of Lydia was Croesus, Croesus dies or lives but becomes satrap in a far away land, Croesus' son, the Prince of Lydia dies, the satrap of Lydia is still not a Baileus, SO WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE KING WHO CONQUERS LYDIA IN 546 BC? BASICALLY, WHO GETS THE TITLE OF BASILEUS SO THAT PERSIAN KINGS AFTER HIM STILL HAVE THE TITLE OF THE BASILEUS? WHAT ARTICLE SAYS LATER PERSIAN KINGS WERE CALLED BASILEUS? Pss! (See [[Basileus]] article). I think your telling me as Croesus died, his title of Basileus (which believe it or not means king) FADED INTO THIN AIR? History and contempories say know one could have carried on the god forsaken title, so that leaves one person, the KING OF KINGS, KING OF MEDIA, KING OF LYDI*, KING OF BABYLON, KING OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH. Still don't know who it is? I will close my eyes and take a deep breath.--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 14:58, 23 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

NOW i got this from Amizzoni's reply: And look at what happened below!

King of Babylon: He uses it in the Cyrus Cylinder Doug quotes, and he is called so in Babylonian documents. King of Neo-Babylonia is not a title, it was made up by Ariobarza.(ACTUALLY HE IS KNOWN TO HAVE CONQUERED THE NEO-BABLYONIAN OR CHALDEAN EMPIRE AS SEEN ON THE MAP ON HIS ARTICLE!) 
King of Persia, or Great King of Persia, of even Shahenshah if you prefer: He is called so in by the Nabonidus Chronicle (king of Parsu) and by Greek authors. It is agreed among scholars that he was king of Persia (although DT Potts called it into question in a recent article published in Birth of the Persian Empire; I think his view is not at all mainstream). The problem with Shahanshah (King of Kings) is that it is Modern Persian; in Old Persian it was rendered xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām. Furthermore, xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām is only attested since Darius I. 
King of Media: Herodotus, Ctesias and Xenophon says he took the throne of Media. I don't know what happened in Cyrus' times, but I'm quite sure that Xerxes is called King of Persia and Media in Babylonian documents, so it is a real title that the Persian kings used (I mean, it wasn't made up by Ariobarza). The problem is that I'm unable to find any academic book or article calling Cyrus &quot;King of Media&quot; or discussing the matter (in fact I haven't searched a lot).(NOTICE AMIZZONI SAYS THAT THE GREEK AUTHORS SAY THIS AND THAT, SAME THING I SAID TO YOU FOR LYDIA TITLE, AND YOU TURNED ME DOWN, AND EVEN IF XERXES IS CALLED KING OF MEDIA, THATS STILL AFTER HIS DEATH, AGAIN LIKE I SAID BEFORE CYRUS THEY CALLED THEM BASILEUS OR KING OF LYDIA, AND AMIZZONI SAYS IT WAS AFTER THAT THEY SAID KING OF MEDIA, BY THE WAY BASILEUS I SAID A MILLION TIMES WERE THE TITLE GIVEN TO ALL PERSIAN KINGS WHILE ALIVE, AND THE FIRST PERSIAN RULER OF LYDIA WAS CYRUS!) I hope you can understand the irony I putting up with here!--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 15:11, 23 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

:Here is what I wrote on my talk page in reply.
:No sources deny it, and it's so obvious you can barely find it because the scholars don't say it, they imply it. That's your problem in a nutshell. You need to read WP:OR and {{WP:SYN]]. And please don't say 'other articles are bad' because that is definitely not a good argument. And while we are on the subject of sources, I hope you have stopped creating articles with no reliable sources. I've got some good sources for a couple of articles you've created that way, but I can't find any for your Battle of the Median Border -- there is no battle of that name I can find. So,I'll help where I can, but if between the two of us we can't find reliable sources, it'll have to go to AfD. It's not as though other people have said the same thing to you.
:Now to add to that. First, I think this is all due to a misunderstanding on Ariobarza's part on how Wikipedia works. In this case, editor's should never add their own conclusions, only what other people -- reliable, verifiable sources (Ariobarza, have you read the policies and guidelines on this?) have said. And we are talking about Cyrus's '''titles''', specifically those which he actually used.  
:Now, you asked about what AfD is and if you are in trouble. Nope, you're definitely not in trouble, but you haven't been following guidelines for creating new articles. Have you read [[Wikipedia:Starting an article]]? If not, please read it.
:My example in this case is your article [[Battle of the Median Border]]. It consists of the sentence &quot;The Battle of the Median Border, is the second encounter of the forces of Media and Persia together.&quot; and an infobox that tells us that Nicholas of Damascus had both heavy and light casualties and that there were up to 250,000 combatants (with Nicolas again fighting on both sides). There are no references. It also has the date, 551 BC. It links to [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] who is a Syrian historian in Herod's time.  This is simply not enough for an article. Now if I could (and I don't think I should have to, the article should have been created according to guidelines and policies), I'd try to enhance it with sources at the expense of time I'd rather spend doing something else. But I can't, because I can't find such a battle.  It doesn't seem to belong in an encyclopedia, and Wikipedia is meant to be an online encyclopedia reporting what reliable sources say about a subject.  So here's how it works. I've tried to find sources, now it's your turn.  Find some sources to flesh the article out. I'll watch it, if there are problems about the sources I'll try to help and we can discuss them on the talk page.  If you can't find any, there is something called the Articles for Deletion process. Someone (me probably, but you can if you decide you can't turn it into a good article, you can't delete even your own article) lists it on the AfD page for a particular date, putting a template on the article leading to the discussion. Editors then put their reasons for keeping or deleting the article. It may look like a vote but it isn't. After 5 days or so an Administrator looks at the arguments and makes a decision as to what to do about it. 
:You have other unsourced articles I may be able to find sources for and if I can I will.  But as I've said, it shouldn't be necessary.  The only article I have created I created on a subpage of mine and created it there with sources, etc, then created it as a new article. --[[User:Dougweller|Doug Weller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 16:21, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

==The date of his death==
I found this on the cyrus article of 1911encyclopedia.org site, which says, (His death occurred in 528 B.C., as we have a Babylonian tablet from the Adar of the tenth year of Cyrus, i.e. February 528; for in Babylon the first year of Cyrus began in the spring of 538.) I'm not sure if this is true, but I know that Cyrus invaded Babylon in 539, but it was in spring 538 that he officially began his rule after he had conquered it. Anyways, I always thought he died either mid-August 530 or 529 B.C. Here is the link, http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Cyrus. When anyone reading this gets there, scroll down to the death of Cyrus, where it talks about it. So if anyone wants to verify it, please go ahead and comment here or on my page, or both, goodbye.--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 02:55, 27 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

:See note 5: &quot;Cyrus' date of death can be deduced from the last reference to his own reign (a tablet from Borsippa dated to 12 August 530 BC) and the first reference to the reign of his son Cambyses (a tablet from Babylon dated to 31 August); see R.A. Parker and W.H. Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C. - A.D. 75, 1971.)&quot; He died on August 530 BC. An encyclopedia published in 1911 is outdated.

Hey, thanks for responding to my call. But the fact that the article on www.1911encyclopedia.org is OUTDATED, IS NOT THE ISSUE. You know, Herodotus is outdated too, but the info he provides most of the time is true. Anyways, if they find a tablet from Babylon that shows Cyrus' last breath, not reign was longer than what is said on Wikipedia. It means Wikipedia is outdated. Now, it is possible that by the time he reached the area of his final battle a year had passed, and if his death is ranged from 530-528 BC, I THINK IT WAS MOST LIKLEY IN 529 BC, a reign of 30 years. I'm currently researching to find such a tablet, and if it's found, then I will not outdate Wikipedia, but indated, goodbye.--67.180.225.250 (talk) 09:25, 28 June 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

== Um... His CHARTER OF FREE RIGHTS??? ==
I was reading, and i saw that there was hardly any mention of his charter of free rights. Now, shouldn't there be some kind of &quot;goog&quot; expansion into this? This was the first occurence of something like this, as to not take slaves, let the invaded country keep its own religion and ways, and even king. They payed the workers from teh captured countries.

:: The above-mentioned article in ''der Spiegel'' is just a worthless and ugly piece of propaganda. Any person who has even a passing knowledge of history can clearly see that the article by Mr Matthias Schulz overwhelms in falsehoods. Here is an example. Mr Schulz writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:::...priests of the god Marduk were committing treason against their own country. Angry over the loss of power they had suffered under their king, they secretly opened the gates and allowed hostile Persian negotiators to enter the city. [...] In truth, Cyrus merely freed his own followers. [...] In compensation for their treacherous services, the priests were given money and estates. In return, they praised Cyrus as a &quot;great&quot; and &quot;just&quot; man and as someone who &quot;saved the entire world from hardship and distress.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:: Now anyone who knows anything at all, knows that [[Cyrus the Great]] was referred to as a &quot;great&quot; and &quot;just&quot; king in [[Old Testament]] (''[[Ezra]]'', Chapter I onwards). It follows that Mr Schulz is implicitly asserting that the elders and priests of the [[Jewish]] community in ancient [[Babylon]] must have been involved in paying &quot;treacherous services&quot; to Cyrus the Great. But this directly contradicts the earlier statement by Mr Schulz that these priests were the priests of the god [[Marduk]]. Can there be any doubt that Mr Schulz is involved in creating historical falsehoods? Mr Schulz seems to be loath to mention that Cyrus the Great released Jews held in captivity in Babylon; he instead refers to Cyrus' &quot;own followers&quot;. Clearly, the Jewish captives in Babylon were by no recorded account &quot;followers&quot; of Cyrus the Great! Who were these &quot;followers&quot; actually? Mr Schulz does not mention. In fact, I am not aware of any of the historical sources that Mr Schulz must have supposedly relied upon in writing the above-mentioned treacherous article. What Mr Schulz writes is in direct contradiction with what we know through, for instance, Old Testament and [[Xenophon]]'s  [[Cyropaedia]]. The interested may wish to consult the latter text at this address: [http://www.iranchamber.com/history/xenophon/cyropaedia_xenophon_book1.php Iran Chamber Society]. 

:: Lastly, I am familiar with the &quot;journalism&quot; of Mr Matthias Schulz (I peruse the German version of ''der Spiegel'' on almost daily basis), and consider him a propagandist, rather than a serious journalist; he is very consistently always the same ill-informed, pernicious and jingoistic person.

Thanks for the page numbers.  I will check them more carefully later.  I did want to point out that [[Jona Lendering]], whom you have often quoted, in his version of the Nabonidus Chronicle (found here: [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/babylon02.html] interprets this ''&quot;In the month of Tašrîtu, when Cyrus attacked the army of Akkad in Opis''  [i.e., Baghdad] ''on the Tigris, the inhabitants of Akkad revolted, but he '' ['''Cyrus or Nabonidus?''']'' massacred the confused inhabitants.'' He is not the only one to question the reference of the personal pronoun. [[User:Tundrabuggy|Tundrabuggy]] ([[User talk:Tundrabuggy|talk]]) 15:43, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

I know what I am about to say does not matter; but the comman sense of Ariobarza tells him that the only reason I would massacre the confused inhabitants, is that if they revolted from me, therefore they were confused and did not know who to fight, me or Cyrus, but I taught them a lesson, so I Nabonidus, slaughtered the confused inhabitants of Akkad, it was me!--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 18:38, 6 October 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

:If you look at Lendering's version, he says at the bottom: &quot;This translation was made by A. Leo Oppenheim and is copied from James B. Pritchard's Ancient Near Eastern texts relating to the Old Testament, 1950 Princeton. Some minor changes have been made.&quot; The comments in brackets are not in Oppenheim's original text, which says &quot;(Nabonidus)&quot; instead. An article in vol. 35 of ''The Ancient World'' calls this interpretation &quot;perverse&quot; and correctly notes that modern translations such as Kuhrt's (or Grayson's, or Glassner's) &quot;more plausibly see the perpetrator as Cyrus&quot;. This certainly makes more sense in the context - it was common practice for conquerors to massacre the inhabitants of resisting cities in order to encourage other cities to surrender without fighting (as Sippar and Babylon did). The Romans famously did that, and it would be no surprise for Cyrus to do it too. I obtained a recent translation by Maria Brosius (in ''The Persian Empire from Cyrus II to Artaxerxes I'') in which she comments: &quot;After the Babylonian defeat at Opis, both Sippar and Babylon surrendered, opening the gates of their cities to the enemy. In doing so, the people of Sippar and Babylon had made a choice between accepting a new ruler or being killed and having their city destroyed. The chronicle clearly depicts Cyrus as a ruthless military conqueror, a portrait which stands in sharp contrast to the image of the benign ruler related by himself [in the Cyrus cylinder], and presented in the books of the Old Testament.&quot; -- [[User:ChrisO|ChrisO]] ([[User talk:ChrisO|talk]]) 18:43, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

::Re Lendering's version, I had pointed out earlier that his translation had &quot;differences&quot; that we are unaware of, and thus had to be taken with caution.  However that particular line demonstrates that even Lendering whose general pov is in line with yours acknowledges that it is unclear whom that passage is referencing. Nor, as I have said, is he the only one who recognizes the confusion in the personal pronoun.  It is so out-of-character with the Cyrus the Great that we ''do'' know, that there are even contemporary translator(s) who claim the whole passage is mis-translated. Thus it seems to me that we are doing [[OR]] when we try to determine a &quot;correct&quot; version based on certain translators (or historians) and not on others.

:::We're not in the business of deciding which translation is &quot;correct&quot;, merely which is the prevalent modern interpretation. There's a common interpretation of the disputed line by essentially all the modern translators of the Nabonidus Chronicle's full text - Grayson (1975), Brosius (2000), Tavernier (2003, in Dutch) Glassner (2004) and Kuhrt (2007). Lendering uses the older Oppenheim translation from 1950, for some reason. As for being &quot;out-of-character with the Cyrus the Great that we do know&quot;, this is just an assumption on your part, I'm afraid. We ''don't'' &quot;know&quot; Cyrus for the simple reason that he's been dead for 2,500 years, there are very few more-or-less contemporary sources on his life and none of them are remotely objective. All we &quot;know&quot; is that there a majority of modern translators follow a common interpretation of the Nabonidus Chronicle's description of the Battle of Opis.

== Cyrus cylinder ==

After reading that sections and other posts in discussion page, I have decided to put it up for disputition and undue weight. There is a great deal of original research that has been done in that section. It has simply brough together material from various sources, to make &quot;ONE&quot; point. I have visited the British museum website, and it does not merely trying to make a point like this section does. Again, Wikipedia is not for tyring to make a &quot;point&quot; of your judgments. I read that some users &quot;think&quot; that since Cyrus entered Babylon as a conquerer it is not possible for this cylinder to represent human rights, and these users have made the changes in this section. Wikipedia is not a place for your thoughts and judgements. the cylinder and what it represents should be discussed from both sides. The important  aspect that support the human right claim is that its claim is supported by Jewish and Babylonian sources, unlike the ones before it. The article fails to make mention this.There is a great deal of &quot;reenforcment of one idea over another &quot; in this section. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.12.101.45|74.12.101.45]] ([[User talk:74.12.101.45|talk]]) 18:03, 18 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== [[Richard Frye]] quote ==

I think that this quote is too long and given too much weight. He is an esteemed academic and a fervent proponent of Persian culture but there are other opinions, and too give this clearly POV quote two paragraphs as a block quote does not meet [[WP:NPOV]]. [[User:Dougweller|dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 22:10, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
:A quote is a quote. I do not see why this is problem with [[WP:NPOV]]. 1. The article has no size problem. 2. I think giving the opinion of a top modern scholar in the specific form of '''quote''' with his name mentioned in the body of the article, gives a good alternative view of what is usual in Eurocentric texts. This is what I think. 3. You did not mention what are those views that you say: &lt;u&gt;there are other opinions&lt;/u&gt;.--[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 22:54, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
::I have to agree with Dougweller. The specific problem that this quote presents is one of [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] on one individual scholar's viewpoint. Why is Frye's POV so important that it deserves such prominence? -- [[User:ChrisO|ChrisO]] ([[User talk:ChrisO|talk]]) 23:32, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
: A quote is a quote, it's a point of view by design. Richard Frye is the the most renowned scholar of Achaemenid studies, so his viewpoint is not the viewpoint of just another scholar. It's also not the the job of the Wikipedia editors to call such prominent scholar a &quot;fervent proponent&quot; of X or Y, or question his authority on the subject. --[[User:WrongDude|WrongDude]] ([[User talk:WrongDude|talk]]) 23:44, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
: You could, however, include a quote from a an equally prominent scholar of Achaemenid studies, who holds a different opinion on Cyrus's legacy. --[[User:WrongDude|WrongDude]] ([[User talk:WrongDude|talk]]) 23:51, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
:: He is a high-profile scholar of Achaemenid studies, certainly, but not a godlike voice of authority. I think it would be questionable to call him &quot;the most renowned scholar&quot; (most renowned among who? and why?). But your approach violates NPOV in any case: &quot;None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as &quot;the truth&quot;, in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one.&quot; I don't see any harm in mentioning Frye's POV, but not with such prominence and not in such a way that it suggests everyone thinks the same way as him. -- [[User:ChrisO|ChrisO]] ([[User talk:ChrisO|talk]]) 00:21, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
:::Forget about what I, he, she , that , it call R. Frye. Let us go into the matter, as your previous comment mentions:  [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. It says: &lt;u&gt;In general, articles should not give minority views ''as much'' or as detailed a description as more popular views,&lt;/u&gt; Do you implicitly mean that R. Frye has a minority view? (update: the quote is in the legacy section anyway. So R.Frye's quote could be called simply the legacy of Cyrus the Great among modern scholars of Iranian studies. That's it.) --[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 00:39, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

== Cyrus was not remembered by the Sassanian Dynasty ==

&quot;The Sasanians claimed to be heirs to the Achaemenids; but of those kings they preserved the names only of the first and last Darius (Daray), and one or three Artaxexes (Ardashir).&quot; ([[Mary Boyce]], The Religion of Cyrus the Great, in Achaemenid History III, p. 30.)

:::&quot;The Sasanians claimed to be heirs to the Achaemenids; but of those kings they preserved the names only of the first and last Darius (Daray), and one or three Artaxexes (Ardashir). This Vistaspa was identified, at least by the fourth century AD, with Kavi Vistaspa, Zoroaster's patron - an identification which had enormous propaganda value, since it made Zoroastrianism by origin a western instead of an eastern Iranian religion, and presented Sasanians as its hereditary protectors and hence as the rightful rulers of all Zoroastrians, i.e. of all Iran; but it left no place to Cyrus.&quot; ([[Mary Boyce]], The Religion of Cyrus the Great, in Achaemenid History III, p. 30.) 1- The Sasanians didn't remember Cyrus' name. 2- There was no place for Cyrus in the Sassanid official tradition. Anyway, now I read here that &quot;Cyrus was apparently still remembered in popular song in Sasanian Persia&quot; (Boyce, same page but bellow), and it is certainly worth of mention.

::::I would have appreciated if you could give better reasoning and a better detailed source. What you say is wrongly spread around. I can not accept your conclusion, however I accept the existence of some evidences (in last centuries of Sasanian empire). But to have a definitive conclusion, well we need more sources (and independent: in the sense that they do not repeat and quote each other). Are you aware of Shahbazi's article? ([http://www.humanities.uci.edu/sasanika/pdf/shahbazi.pdf here]). In middle persian sources, cyrus and Achaemenid empire were remembred. I will do research to find out wether Yarshater (and Boyce) claim is accepted among scholars.--[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 23:58, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
:::::Also, Shapur I saw himself as the heir to Cyrus the Great:... (as stated explicitly The History of Ancient Iran, by Frye p. 371). So I can summarize: &quot;Sassanian/kings conidered themselves as the heirs to Achaemenids/Cyrus the Great&quot; is supported by Frye (and to some extent Shahbazi), and rejected by Yarshater, Boyce. There are two different opinions: both explained in [http://books.google.com/books?id=6MmfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1 The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Persia] by Roaf (pp. 1-8) and Herrmann (pp. 38-51).

::::::Thanks for pointing to Shabazi's article, I wasn't aware of it. So, then, we should state both positions (Frye's and Yarshater's). Perhaps we should write: &quot;Many of the dynasties that followed the Achaemenids (the [[Seleucids]] and possibly the [[Sassanids]] in ancient times, and the [[Pahlavis]] in the 20th century) have claimed to continue the line begun by Cyrus.&quot;, with an explanatory note in Sassanids.

Now an important qualification: In general, articles should not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and will generally not include tiny-minority views at all.

== please do not remove sourced materials. ==

The [[User:Dougweller]] has removed &lt;u&gt;several&lt;/u&gt; sentences well sourced. But your edit summaries: 1.  you wrote &quot;I can't find anything about 'advantage and profit for all in the reference' - either a short quote or explain it on the talk page please.&quot; What? did you click on the [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f4/v1f4a109.html link] to Encyclopaedia Iranica and see the sentence: &lt;u&gt;The Achaemenids’ role in universal history lies in their fashioning a model for centralized rule over various peoples with different customs, laws, religions, languages, etc. to the advantage and profit of all and their achievement of a unified Iranian nation for the first time.&lt;/u&gt; In your view this is different from what I had added? 2. you wrote &quot;again, I don't think the source backs the statement, let's discuss this on the talk page&quot; Did you check the source? The source states explicitly: &lt;u&gt;Within a few years he founded a multinational empire without precedent—a first world-empire of historical importance, since it embraced all previous civilized states of the ancient Near East...His son Cambyses II added Egypt (in 525 B.C.), Nubia, and Cyrenaica (Libya).&lt;/u&gt; I revert to my edit, and please explain here &lt;u&gt;explicitly&lt;/u&gt; what your problems with my edits are. --[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 19:27, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

::Personal attacks are not a good thing. Two things here. Somehow I found the wrong Schmitt article, that's almost certainly my fault.

:::My edit was fair. I did mention empire after Cyrus the Great. And I did not reduce everything to Cyrus the Great. If we note, maybe we should mention it as well, that Cyrus erected Pasargadae. And for almost all the time It was the center. Moreover by reverting you removed many other things and not only one sentence. Maybe we should give more weight to the empire in that sentence but I do believe that: 1. the Achaemenid empire as a military power got its wonderful peak at the time of Darius the Great, 2. but the empire as &quot;well established state&quot;, &quot;well administrating&quot;, &quot;tolerant to religion, languages, customs&quot; gets its credit from Cyrus the Great.--[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 19:55, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

:::You may know how to find the source, I clicked on it and no link appeared. And this is clearly copyvio, you are hardly even changing the wording at all (I finally figured out where you got that).

Cyrus the Great) Cyrus’ religious policies.&quot; What is that? This needs to be made a bit more user friendly. As for the other quote, I know that's a quote, I added it, so I don't know what your point is. The epigraph in twice looks like a mistake, but if you don't mind that...

This technology is explained very well in [[WP:CITE]]. I added, it is said,.. and changed the wording a bit. It is your opinion of having a quote of Cyrus the Great twice is irrelevant. In the lead paragraph it is mentioned as a legacy, in the other place it appears as his philosophy and thoughts on military leadership. What is the problem? Moreover, how did you know which one you should delete. You could ask here and people could suggest, whether they should keep both or they have to delete one, and in the latter case which one. This would be according to [[WP:CONS]]. What else is your problem, was refering to calling certain statement as &quot;clearly opinion&quot;. Did you notice that that statement is in the legacy section? So it is fine. Moreover you had changed, which I restored my edition, the &quot;Persian empire&quot; to &quot;Achaemenid dynasty&quot;.

It should be somewhere other than just the footnote. As for the epigraph, it looks 'naked' the second time. I really thought it was just left over from earlier edits, you see that sort of problem from time to time in articles. I still don't think it looks right there htough.

Other points you have are of course related to other sections of this talk page, but generally we should work gradually on the article. We should not delete what other editors have added. step by step! be patient. I am just against any removal of texts without suggesting first in the talk page.

As per ChrisO being a classical scholar, he is not in the same league as Frye and I found some mistakes in other places with regards to ancient Iran.

::# These mean we look at M. Boyce, E. Yarshater (and yes, R. Frye on this issue will not be interesting to look at) and also Persian language sources. These sources all call Cyrus the Great definitely Zoroastrian.
::# Now we look at your source: It has multiple issues that has made me consider providing alternative sources to any article using P. Briant. Why is that:
::## The page 94: states the &quot;former never spake&quot;. This gives a proof that this source is out-dated: It is clear to any serious person familiar with post-1920 scholars of Ancient Iran that there are consenous among scholars that Cyrus the Great did indeed ''speak'' in three language who he was. I can be more clear if necessary.
::## The page 94: On tomb of Cyrus. shows clearly that modern scholars of Zoroastrianism and (here also those of Iranian studies) disagree with P. Briant on the link he is trying to make.

::# Finally, to show that the view of P. Briant is a tiny minority how many sources do you need, so that we consider acting as suggested by [[WP:UNDUE]]?
::I think the article should remain readable: in a way that we do not give 100s of sources for any thing that appears.

One of the ''necessary'' condition for Cyrus the Great to be [[Dhul Qarnayn]] is that &quot;He must have been Zoroastrian otherwise no chance.&quot; So we have to count M. Boyce+ all the religious scholars who believe that Cyrus the Great is Dhul Qarnayn and who have never heard of Boyce. I will not take the task of counting them. B. M. Boyce has many writings on this, and only recently she changed to favour of Zoroastrian religion of Cyrus the Great. So why is that? Very simple: The new consensus among scholars about &quot;Date of Zoroaster&quot;. Agreement on this makes half of the arguments that your source mention invalid. C. Another part of the problem is from noting his Tomb. This is not serious and (History of Antiquity volume 2 by Max Danker) very easily proves invalidity of [[Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorrus]] account (17.71) of his understanding &quot;Tomb&quot; and &quot;Zoroastrianism&quot;.

== Contradictions ==

This article contradicts itself several times. For instance, at one point Anshan and Parsa are alternate names for the same kingdom, but later on they are referred to as separate states. It says Smerdis was king of Persia but also that he died before Cambyses, hence did not become king. It states that we don't know when Cyrus conquered Lydia, then confidently gives the date of the fall of Sardis as 546 BC.--[[User:Syd Henderson|Syd Henderson]] ([[User talk:Syd Henderson|talk]]) 22:06, 5 July 2009 (UTC)
::The comment of Dandamaev that &quot;Anshan and Parsa are the names of the same land&quot; refers to how &quot;some&quot; ancient sources should be understood. It does not say they were the same! The article does need revision, especially that there are lots of corrupt website references which should be deleted and the article should follow one major source and be written accordingly. This does not mean only one source should be used, but to keep the article consistent. Note how difficult was to convince one IP editor that Cyrus had four children by Cassandane and not five. Now I don't care how many children this couple had, but only wanted to be consistent. However I failed to convince the Ip editor and he put 5 children without mentioning who says that and why others (some of the cited articles of Schmitt, Dandamaev) contradict that. So as long as &quot;totally different&quot; sources are going to be used, it is difficult to keep an article on ancient topics free of contradiction.--[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 22:49, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

== Dhul-Qarnayn ==

It is incorrect to say that Dhul-Qarnayn of Quran referred to Cyrus.  Only two scholars tried that and both had their agenda.  First was the Iranian Shia cleric Tabatabai and he was showing bias towards his Iranian hero.  Second was Maudoodi who was trying to woo the Shias those days.

In reality, all the adventures of Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in Quran are the Jewish book Alexander's romance, proving Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander.

Also note that the tale of Dhul-Qarnayn was narrated in Quran because Jews asked Mohammed about Dhul-Qarnayn.  Now Cyrus was not a Jewish hero but jews did regard Alexander in their books e.g. Alexander's romance.

== Cyrus Cylinder proves that Cyrus the Great abolished slavery? ==

I have heard that Cyrus the Great abolished slavery in the Persian Empire and that the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] proves this claim.

I went to the article here on Wikipedia about the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], but I came away very confused and perplexed. It seems that there is an ongoing debate in the discussion page for that article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cyrus_cylinder, over whether or not the Cyrus Cylinder mentions the abolition of slavery at all.

Someone on that discussion page directed me to the following translation of the Cyrus Cylinder: http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder2.html. This translation seemed to be based on scholarly, academic sources, so I decided to go ahead and read it.

Now, I simply do not see a single mention of slavery, much less its abolition, in that translation. What is going on here? I am missing something completely obvious?

Is that translation inaccurate or mistaken? If so, then could someone please post an accurate translation of the Cyrus Cylinder where it states that Cyrus the Great abolished slavery?

If the translation is indeed correct, then where is the evidence to support the claim that Cyrus the Great abolished slavery? Are there other independent sources from the ancient world that state this?

Personally, I think that it would be of the utmost importance to clear up this issue as soon as possible. If Cyrus the Great did abolish slavery more than 2500 ago, then that would be a momentously important deed for human history. But, if not, then where do these claims arise from? I am just very confused about this topic, and it seems that Wikipedia has conflicting information on this, so we should try to correct whatever it is that needs correcting. Did Cyrus the Great abolish slavery in the Persian Empire or not? [[Special:Contributions/76.203.224.124|76.203.224.124]] ([[User talk:76.203.224.124|talk]]) 15:02, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

This article here on Cyrus the Great used to say this, but now I see that it is gone completely. However, if the claims are true, then it should stay in the article. The article on the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]] makes the claim that Cyrus abolished slavery directly and forcefully. So, who is right - this article here on Cyrus the Great or the article on the Persian Empire?

As for our anonymous friend's questions: no, there is no scholarly translation that addresses slavery. I've read (and have copies of) virtually all of the scholarly translations made over the past 120 years and none even mention slavery. The only &quot;translation&quot; that does mention slavery is a fake one, apparently circulated by Iranian nationalists seeking to promote Cyrus's reputation. It is mentioned on the livius.org website at [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html]. The existence of this fake translation is what prompted the webmaster of livius.org, Dutch historian Jona Lendering, to put online the scholarly translation which you linked in your post. Lendering writes: &quot;Until now, there was no edition of the Cyrus Cylinder available on the internet; the only thing that was available, was a falsified translation - possibly created by followers of the late Shah - in which Cyrus is presented as saying that he will respect foreign customs and decreeing religious freedom. This falsification is not recognized as such, and several well-meaning scholars who sought to explain that - whatever his virtues - Cyrus was not the author of the first charter of human rights, have received highly offensive messages.&quot; I can certainly testify to that myself - some people seem to get very upset when you criticise the completely anachronistic views of the cylinder that the Shah and his supporters promoted. -- [[User:ChrisO|ChrisO]] ([[User talk:ChrisO|talk]]) 21:34, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

It's a complete misrepresentation of Kuhrt's views - she argues in the piece ''against'' such claims. She's quoting those earlier authors specifically to repudiate their views, not to endorse them.

:It's hardly &quot;stolen&quot;, is it? Buried in the foundations of a temple in Babylon (which isn't in Iran, last time I looked at the map) and never expected to be retrieved by anyone? I find it rather ironic that you're accusing me of &quot;pushing my own POV&quot; when you make nonsensical statements like that. The BM's view of the cylinder is ''highly'' significant, because it's not just a museum, it's a very active research centre which has been involved in ancient Mesopotamian archaeology for over 120 years. Don't forget that it was the BM that found the cylinder in the first place (it funded the original excavation). And as I said before, the BM is itself citing other scholars, not just promoting its own view.
:I ''have'' cited the BM in relation to the &quot;charter of human rights&quot; claim (check the sources) but that claim needs to be put in the proper context, i.e. that it was put forward by the late Shah as part of his regime propaganda.

&lt;B&gt;It is a matter of question that:&lt;/B&gt; When was the first time the idea of weakening the Human Rights weight of the Cylinder was seriously discussed and whether it relates to the 2006 talks between Ahmadinejad gov. officials and British Museum to bring the Cylinder back to Persia (Iran). 2006 seems to be the year of publication of the source for this idea (the first of the three sources mentioned in British Museum's site). The anti-Persian trend in films such as 300 and a number of other politically oriented cases makes a fair historian think again about such new or (old but) weak claims.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/95.147.232.197|95.147.232.197]] ([[User talk:95.147.232.197|talk]]) 03:14, 2 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Cyrus and the Achaemenids ==

Several articles on wikipedia use the following outdated Iranica article (written in the early 1980s) to link Cyrus and his predecessors to Darius I and his successors. It relies on CMa-c which is nowadays regarded as Darius' forgery in order to legitimize his claim to the throne. [[User:Ellipi|Ellipi]] ([[User talk:Ellipi|talk]]) 22:50, 28 December 2009 (UTC)
:Please note [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v9f3/v9f393a.html this] Iranica article (written in the late 1990s), which states: ''There are no arguments in favor of a concurrent rule of two lines of the Achaemenids. To the contrary, it seems that the Teispids (decendants of Čišpiš/Teispes), the line of Cyrus, and the Achaemenids, the line of Darius, ought to be seen as distinctly separate from each other''.

:::::Thats OR. Note the following point &quot;according to ''all'' available sources&quot; (all Iranian inscription+Greek historians) and &quot;the latest archaeological evidence&quot; Cyrus was an achaemenian in the same meaning that Darius was. Therefore how you can say that &quot;we remove the title of ''Achaemenid'' from pre-Darius I rulers&quot;? some more points:
:::::# who has said that Cyrus and Darius are related?
:::::# the previous edit that [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v9f3/v9f393a.html this article] &quot;challenges&quot; Achaemenian-ness of Cyrus is wrong. Where does it say that? It states the point that my previous edits said: there are conflicting arguments of scholars on the point: &quot;achaemenian had one line or two lines?&quot; This is unrelated to Achaemenian-ness of Cyrus. Therefore Ellipi I think you misunderstand the point (you mention) that &quot;There are no arguments in favor of a concurrent rule of two lines of the Achaemenid&quot;. THIS IS UNRELATED TO WHAT SCHMIDT SAYS. (please see this discussion [http://books.google.com/books?id=jIA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 5-?] of a book by Dandamaev to see the discussion is about &quot;two lines&quot; or &quot;one line&quot;.)
:::::# According to [[wp:undue]] I think we should remove walter article.
::::: Also you have stated &quot;It relies on CMa-c which is nowadays regarded as Darius' forgery..&quot; This is wrong. CMa(,b,c) is what [Name_of_Cyrus|this article's image]] shows. You are confusing DB with this inscription. Also removing Achaemenin from the title of Cyrus the Great is based on that misunderstanding and I think should be undone.

:::1 Darius claimed it on Behistun inscription.
:::2 The second Iranica link clearly says that there was not two lines of Achaemenids via Teispes, i.e. Teispes was not a descendent of Achaemenes. 
:::3 CM is not the same as DB. CM is an inscription by Darius in which Cyrus is represented as an Achaemenian. It is nowadays generally known to be a forgery by Darius I to legitimize his constructed Achaemenid lineage to Cyrus. [[User:Ellipi|Ellipi]] ([[User talk:Ellipi|talk]]) 09:48, 29 December 2009 (UTC)
:::::You are wrong: 3. CM is according to Stronach and Schmidt from Cyrus the Great. 2. the Iranica article does not say anything like what you say. It states what the Cambridge ancient history and the link above says, If you want that you need to put it somewhere that states &quot;there are two lines of Achaemenids that were joined together by Darius&quot;. This is all that is DISPUTED. 2. Darius does not say anything like that either, they all claim being descendent of Achaemenes. Finally if you do not mind, later I will write a section on this &quot;two lines vs one line&quot; rulers (in the [[Achaemenid Empire|appropriate page]]) and will add the quote from the article you use.

Kent, Old Persian, p. 116), which was ascribed to him by F. H. Weissbach and others, belongs to Cyrus the Great&quot;, see also Schmidt article on Cyrus II where he says &quot;In his inscriptions from Pasargadae Cyrus declared “I am Kūruš the king, an Achaemenid,”&quot;), 2. If you read what I say you know that the assumption that CM is from Darius is based on a false interpretation of DB 70 (maybe caused by Wiesehoefer, (since 1980) now totally disregarded, see the wiki article on name of Cyrus). 3. On stronach I meant &quot;I am Cyrus&quot; in CM is meant to be &quot;Cyrus the Great&quot;: the new research (see [http://www.jstor.org/pss/4030862 this abd many references there], [http://books.google.com/books?id=vRR8dfI7j_kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false see also chapter 7 of this book]) show that the inscription can not be from any body than &quot; a Cyrus&quot; (now, stronach and others imply that &quot;this&quot; Cyrus is in fact Cyrus II). In any case, if you want these mentioned, we need to have a separate section on Achaemenian family in the appropriate article. I will do this once the real life get a bit calm!

I had chosen the wording &quot;other inscriptions&quot; without saying who inscribed those. Why do you insist on not mentioning of &quot;probably Darius created sources&quot;? Independent of what you think of them. If you want you can add &quot;probably engraved under Darius&quot; to the sentence just like what the source (from Dandamaev) does. Secondly, the reason that I removed the link is simple: he refers to Stronach and Walter and (copied by Briant. Also I agree with Ghirshman who did make the argument &quot;DB paragraph 70 was misread&quot; and therefore most of arguments that gives Darius the credits of being first to write in OP looks a bit strange. Strange. In any case the debate is much more serious than what I thought, (though I have not found a satisfactory updated discussion, I am searching for a newest references). Also as I said what you do is OR: the &quot;relief&quot; of four-winged is from Cyrus the Great himself while &quot;some scholars&quot; believe that CM &quot;inscription&quot; is not from Cyrus the Great, therefore Cyrus was according to &quot;some scholars&quot; unrelated to Achaemenes. This is really OR. Though waters mention this explicitly. [[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 02:16, 31 December 2009 (UTC)

::::::::::::As I noted above, all updated sources I've seen so far, say that Cmabc are forgeries by Darius. There is no OR by me; whoever is responsible for the relief, the guy who added those inscriptions was Darius. (there are also concerns that some of these inscriptions are modern forgeries).

After realizing that Darius Behistun is not the same as CMabc, and that Stronach said it is Darius's work not Cyrus', and that there is difference between [[relief]] and [[inscription]], and so on, it's time to accept that there is a difference between Cambyses I and Cambyses II. Thanks. [[User:Ellipi|Ellipi]] ([[User talk:Ellipi|talk]]) 02:01, 1 January 2010 (UTC)
Ellipi, please do not do OR. CAmbyses was an Achaemenian. He can be called Teispids too. There is no contradiction. Why do you remove this sentence &quot;Cassandane's identification as such stems primarily from heredotus, but it supported, directly and indirectly, by analysis of ancient Near Eastern evidence.&quot; (from Waters). Even Waters states on page 97 of his article (cited) that &quot;Cambyses the Achaemenid&quot;. If I am Achaemenian it does not mean I am not anything else. Very simple. You have confused the entire discussion, I was the one who told you what is the name of inscription, I was the one who gave the sources that you copy pasted into other article. ''I am the one who wrote much of this section of the article'', a mistake on I and II does not make my edit a bad one, sometime one makes typographical mistake. Cambyses I being achaemenian makes Cambyses II achaemenian, but this is also because of Cassandane. Do you see your misunderstanding? Your problem is you think: if some's grandfather is not an achaemenian then that one is not either. This logic is pre-historic.

:::You did not give me a source that I copied to another article; I've got dozens of sources but provide them one by one in order to be discussed here on the talk page and not confuse you. what I say is that there was a distinction between line of Cyrus and line of Darius; At least for the time being we can call both lines Achaemenids, since that's how they have been called in Greek literature (under darius' propaganda), and because line of Darius were heirs of line of Cyrus (a power shift between two families while keeping the empire unchanged).

Please write according to RS and V. Curus II established &quot;Achaemenian Empire&quot; no matter what &quot;Achaemenian&quot; means. This logic is difficult for you, I know. But I help you: 1. Being Achemenian is to be understood in two ways. a. descendent of Achaemenes the real man, b. a king of an empire which was/is called Achaemenid Empire. (for example an empire that Darius used to call, Greeks called, Egyptian called,...). 2. In any case all these people &quot;Cyrus I, II, II&quot; and the people of the lines you created in mind are Achaemenian. THIS IS THE LOGIC YOU MISS. respond to your BTW: please stick to matters. Cambyses I-&gt;Cyrus the Great-&gt; Cambyses II, is the family tree according to most (except for &quot;II&quot; for Cyrus the Great who can be called &quot;III&quot; as well). Now you want to have Cambyses (I, II) as Teispid. Here on the family background of Cyrus we mention his father and his sons. I am saying Cambyses I being Achaemenian makes Cambyses II achaemenian.

::::::# Also please visit [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unrelated this page]. Because this sentence &quot; However it has been suggested by M. Waters and that Cyrus is unrelated to Achaemenes or Darius the Great&quot; (from you?) is non-sense. Cyrus was &quot;related&quot; to Darius because of a. Achaemenian-ness of Darius and Cyrus' wife and Darius' wife being Cyrus's daughter. So you agree that &quot;unrelated to ... Darius the Great&quot; is non-sense? Because you have to decide whether you trust Darius or not, if so then Cyrus and Darius are from Achaemenes the real man. If not, and you do not trust, then the whole story of Achaemenes is non-sense and the laughable contradiction in this sentence is &quot;Darius and Cyrus can be related through Achaemenes, whose existence you accept (supported only by Darius claims) and on the other hand you disagree with Darius that Cyrus is also Achaemenian&quot;.This is the first problem that you do not get. b. Cyrus is related to Darius because of Darius claims. First tell me what you mean by &quot;relation to Darius&quot;. I can not understand your sentence. 
::::::# &quot;Most of scholars now consider the line of Cyrus as distinct from line of Darius. The line of Cyrus which is called Teispids, formed the early stage of Achaemenid period and some scholars consider it as to be of Anshanite origin&quot; what??? Again, look: an apple can be red but still an apple. Do you understand? Cyrus was a Teispid and Anshanite (that is from Fars province) for &quot;obvious reason&quot;, but he is at the same time &quot;an achaemenid&quot; because all scholars do agree: being achaemenid is Darius concept and he gave that title to Cyrus + (some inscription that are probably from Darius time). Why you think an apple can not be red??? You do OR. and I disagree with that wording. I propose &quot;The traditional view which based on archaeological research and the genealogy given in the Behistun Inscription and Herodotus[8] held that Cyrus was an Achaemenian. This is the view of almost all scholars of Iranian studies, However it has been suggested by some that Cyrus is unrelated to Achaemenes and should be considered Anshanite.&quot; 
::::::# Once again do not do OR: being unrelated to Achaemenes does not make one non-Achaemenian. Because being Achaemenian is what Darius meant. There is no &quot;blood&quot; related meaning in &quot;being Achaemenian&quot;.

{{quotation|In a sense, being &quot;an Achaemenian&quot; or to be in the royal families of &quot;Achaemenid line&quot; of kingship is believed to be a concept due to Darius the Great to which himself and Cyrus were told both to belong.

Dougweller, There is no doubt about the fact that Cyrus loved gardens and was famous for it (however this is not the point and should not be used as a reason for removing the related content). If you have NOT done your research, you may conclude that from the following;

1- Cyrus was a designer of his palaces and gardens of Pasargadae. Refer to &quot;History of Iran, The Median and Achaemenian Periods by Prof. David Stronach&quot; for more info.
2- Cyrus wanted to be called a gardener rather than a king; &quot;Gardens of Persia by Penelope Hobhouse&quot;
3- The fact that the design of the Paradisia has been used as a blue print for many ancient and modern sites, such as Taj Mahal (India), Charbagh (Isfahan), Moorish Gardens (Spain) and many others throughout history, in fact the adaptations started from the time of Alexander (Refer to From Cyrus to Alexander by Pierre Briant)
4- The fact that the name of his gardens has been adopted by almost all the ancient languages of his time such as Greek, Latin, Semitic Langauges and many modern ones.

You may also study the book &quot;The Garden of Cyrus By Sir Thomas Browne in 1658 London&quot;, for further info.
As mentioned, Cyrus's interest and inovation in building his palaces and gardens is an undeniable part of his legacy and can be placed in his article with no problem, while not having it, is a major lack of information! Therefore, I will revise the text and put it back in the article and if you have any other issue with the text, please let me know.

== Source of &quot;Diversity in counsel, unity in command&quot;? ==

What is the original source of the quotation &quot;Diversity in counsel, unity in command&quot;?  The footnote cites an article in the Harvard Business Review.  I found that article, and the author does not give any source for his supposed quotation of Cyrus.  When the quotation appears on other web pages, the source given is either this Wikipedia article or the HBR article, if any source is given.  I would like to include this quotation in an academic paper, but to do so I need the original source.  I'd also like to read it in context.  Is this from Xenophon's Cyropaedia?  If the original source could be found, it would improve this page to cite that rather than a business journal.

== Unreliable sources (and edit summaries) ==

(Moved to correct article. [[User:Pldms|shellac]] ([[User talk:Pldms|talk]]) 19:52, 26 December 2010 (UTC))

Earlier today an editor tweaked a link to a source. When I saw the source it was obvious that we shouldn't be using it, and I removed it, added a reliable source and some more context (with an edit summary). This was part of a long history of using bad sources in this and related articles, by the way, and also by an editor who has only a handful of edits to their name, the 2nd edit this year by that editor, and the first ever to this article. So not a Wikignome. 
Then another editor who is a regular here makes this edit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyrus_the_Great&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=402476293&amp;oldid=402202677]. The edit adds an unreliable source (a networking page) which is also redundant as we don't need anything more to verify a statement that the UN said something about the cylinder (that the statement was made is not disputed). IT also changed the words &quot;own propaganda celebrating&quot; to &quot;celebration of&quot;. Now the reference itself has a quote that uses the phrase &quot;own propaganda celebrating&quot; so the change in the phrase looks pov and unjustified to me. The edit summary was &quot;: Added a new source. The section already references the main article &quot;the cyrus cylinder&quot; so no need to focus on shah's agenda, as this is about Cyrus the Great, not the former.&quot; However, this section is on the Cyrus Cylinder and it was referenced, so I don't think it should be removed.
What the edit summary didn't mention was that the paragraph had been rearranged. Before the edit, it began with the bit about the British Museum, the edit put the UN statement before the BM bit. There have been disputes about this, and it is probably the main change the edit made, but the edit summary doesn't mention it.

I reverted this, with an edit summary simply saying &quot;NIAS isn't a reliable source, it's a networking organisation, and we certainly don't need another source to show that the UN made its declaration, so both unreliable and redundant)&quot;.  I didn't mention the other changes I was reverting. My edit was reverted with a summary saying &quot;Dougweller,  your &quot;edit description&quot; does not match your edits?!!!) &quot; Now that sort of statement is normally an accusation that the editor is deliberately being deceitful and I hope that GoetheFromm will make it clear he isn't making that accusation. Yes, my edit summary was incomplete, but it wasn't something like saying 'grammar change' for a major content change, it just didn't go into detail about what I thought was obvious and I would have happily explained here if asked. On the other hand, the edit summary for the edit I reverted didn't mention that it made a major change in the paragraph, but I see no complaint about that edit summary not being complete. 

So what I see is an editor making 3 changes and explaining two of them but not what was probably the main one. I reverted to the older version and explained one reason. A 3rd editor restores the unreliable source with no comment about that and accuses me, but not the first editor, of an edit summary that didn't match the edit. I never expect edit summaries to be complete and I wasn't going to get into a battle with Dr Persi over his and didn't see the need to be so detailed, and I suggest that we don't get into battles over how exact an edit summary is. Meanwhile we have a situation in which a bad source is restored to the article, another unmentioned change reverted but without a discussion of it, and cited text removed from the article. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 09:50, 26 December 2010 (UTC)

:Sorry I got confused between the two articles. But Dr Persi's made my point above - he thinks the order is important but didn't mention it in his edit summary, but I'm the one who got slated because my edit summary didn't mention that he'd changed the order and I was changing it back.

== Copyvio YouTube links ==

I found two copyvio links to YouTube and removed them, explaining in my edit summary that they were copyvio. Another editor took it upon themselves to restore the links without discussion. I posted what amounts to an informal warning to their talk page and asked them to revert their edit. Although they edited elsewhere on Wikipedia again last night after my message, they didn't remove them. I've now removed them again. We don't link to copyright violations - be it book, article, or video. We only link to the original source or a source which is clearly not a copyright violation, eg some books are out of copyright so we can link to one of the archives such as Gutenberg. And if something is removed with a statement that it is a copyright violation, it isn't sensible to replace it without discussion.

:2) I took your message regarding the issue seriously and read on the issue.  While you are correct, indeed, about how the youtube is copyvio, it would be better if you actually found a non-copyright violation copy of the video, as the video (I just discovered) is very, very useful for the article.  I was researching ways to have an acceptable copy linked to the article. If you have the time, (as I am tired today) DougWeller, I might recommend that you find an acceptable link to the video.

:::On another point, what you are advocating, that is, complete removal of the link is not something, as an editor, that I agree with.  I have, as my edit history indicates, interested in pring the article, but not by selectively choosing what should be removed.

== ChrisO please read this, and tell me what is wrong ==

Hi ChrisO, something conernes me, I think (based on your own neutrality rules) you should stop saying ''but he shows his take over of Babylon was peacefull, but his battle was not peacefull, therefore the Cyrus Cylinder is propaganda.'' Have you ever read the Cyrus Cylinder itself? It is clearly talking a decree to the citizens of the '''city''' of Babylon (the capital, because the empire at the time was called the Chaldaean or Neo-Babylonian Empire), it says his take over was peacefull, and that is TRUE, because he never ''besieged'' Babylon. According to all smushed up accounts, Gubaru diverted its river, and his troops when the water was at hips height entered the city at night, then Cyrus joined later, and then a few guards and ''maybe'' the son of Nabonidus was killed with a candle holder by Gadates and or Gubaru (I KNOW the story from all versions). If his decree was to all Babylonia, then it would make sense it was propaganda because he had fought a battle before, '''BUT''' when he is speaking to the Jews of Babylon, which he is on the tablet, then of course he is speaking to the '''city''' of Babylon were ''all'' the Jews were! Not ''all'' of Babylonia, yet you keep saying he captured Babylon in great bloody battle, when only a couple of guards ''might'' have been killed during the night raid. Thanks. 

Here is what is wrong with ChrisO's neutral point of view, by referencing this it seems unlikely that this is neutrality;

&quot;After the Babylonian defeat at Opis, both Sippar and Babylon surrendered, opening the gates of their cities to the enemy. In doing so, the people of Sippar and Babylon had made a choice between accepting a new ruler or being killed and having their city destroyed. The chronicle clearly depicts Cyrus as a ruthless military conqueror, a portrait which stands in sharp contrast to the image of the benign ruler related by himself [in the Cyrus cylinder], and presented in the books of the Old Testament.&quot;

1. Now here is the problem, Sippar had no choice because it was running out of supplies, and it was Nabonidus plan to shut himself in the city for some strategic plan he had in mind, but it never worked out (I will cite this if you do not believe me). 

2. Babylon did not surrender and open their gates, (EVEN if they thought the Persians were going to destroy everything) the Persians got in '''themselves''', what Kuhrt (I THINK it is a she) says is theoritical commentary, just some extra blah blah to expand her book a little more, it completely contradicts the all the accounts, as you may have read above (actually it might be in talkOpis or talkChrisO) how Babylon was taken, so I will not repeat myself. And I am not saying she did this on purpose, it is possible she did not know. Now history tells us that after the Persians captured Babylon themselves, (and here is the question) did the Persains kill the inhabitants and destroy the city? THIS is what Kuhrt tells us, ''In doing so, the people of Sippar and Babylon had made a choice between accepting a new ruler or being killed and having their city destroyed.'' Will according to all accepted history the Persians '''did not''' destroy or kill anyone in the city of Babylon (which is the capital), they did the opposite. THE GREAT MYSTERY to me is why does ChrisO keep referencing uneutral, biased, somewhat Greek nationalistic, and out of date with a touch of denial in history SOURCES? Sounds like a good recipe huh? ChrisO I got gut feeling that tells me you ''might'' not be neutral, NoW Am I WoRnG?--[[User:Ariobarza|Ariobarza]] ([[User talk:Ariobarza|talk]]) 22:47, 8 October 2008 (UTC)Ariobarza talk

:One thing that you should never forget, it may seem that me (I barely do it though) and others might want to make the Persians look amazing, it is because of ITS HISTORY, we make our points on that, and even if you read Persian history, I think that EVEN you yourself will start talking in a nationalistic tone about Persia. So my point is that I think that you might not know about Persian history that much, therefore you theorise that just because we seem to talk good about Persia we are nationalistic. But what is unfair is that means that all the major historians WHO talk good about Greece are nationalistic too? Generally most historians tend to like Greece more than Persia, because they think the Greeks are the backbone of the Western world, and the IRONY here is that even the Greeks themselves say they got most of their knowledge from the Babylonians, Egyptians, ''Atlantians'', as other historians have also confirmed this whether or not Greeks say it. So up to this time I can assure you that overall this whole problem on Wikipedia, as also do not think that I believe Iranian nationalists ''dont'' exist, I believe Iranian nationalist are out there. But we must analyze; WHY there are IN (short for Iranian Nationalists)? And me knowing much about the problem CAN answer that question. IT is because Persians now feel because of tensions between the west and east, 300, Iranian nuclear program, Iranians think the WEST is trying to kill their culture. ((Now just to know, I am not debating or argueing with you in this paragraph, I am saying what I think the problem is here with facts.)) (AS AN EXAMPLE) Imagine if your Jewish, and Hollywood makes an Anti-semitic flick, US invades Syria, and put sanctions on Israel. Than I can assure you will be VERY defending of your culture, and then Ariobarza calls you a nationalist. So, do you see what I mean, you must analyze why these things are happening in the FIRST place, before telling me and others that we are IN and unbalanced, I am a Libra by the way, and I am balanced. I just hope as a human you can be understanding toward this problem, and NOT make assumptions.

I read a few books and the majority consensus was that (assuming the violent version reported by the Greek scholars is true) that his &quot;remains&quot; were interred in the site. Even after the invasion of the Alexander the Great, Cyrus the Great's burial was still maintained. So I believe the tenative answer to your question is &quot;yes.&quot; [[User:Dr. Persi|Dr. Persi]] ([[User talk:Dr. Persi|talk]]) 18:12, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:Thanks for the answer, Persi. However, is there any reliable information regarding his remains? If there was that 2,500-year celebration in the 1970s something must have been said about what is in the tomb. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 18:52, 11 January 2011 (UTC)


::He was supposedly buried in a golden casket. That hasn't been found and was certainly looted. It seems to have been first looted unsuccessfully in 334 BCE when Alexander discovered an unsuccessful attempt had been made to steal the sarcophagus, with the bones scattered and the tomb resealed. Alexander had what was left put back on the sarcophagus and the tomb resealed, but I believe it was looted again 6 years later. It's quite possible that when the sarcophagus was removed the bones were removed with it and dumped somewhere. So we don't know when it was lost but it may have been around 328. In any case, they aren't in the tomb now. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 19:29, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

:::Well,, that's certainly sad. Shouldn't the article be more precise, then? Be clear that the tomb is now empty? --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 19:47, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

Yes, that is sad. The problem is there is only assumptions as to the events taking place after Alexander the Great's attacks and the suppposed second loot is not confirmed, although frankly it sounds very likely. Even if they did an assessment today to find remnants inside the tomb, it would probably be too late, since by then any bone would decompose. The tomb is more of a symbolic gesture, then an &quot;actual&quot; tomb. Part of the issue is the loss of historical documents in following conflicts be it the Alexander invasion, or the subsequent arab invasion. So ya, it is anybody's guess. Good points though Lechen.

== The Islamic Republic of Iran's view about Cyrus ==

I don't whether now the modern Islamic Republic of Iran regard him as a national hero (or at least a positive historical character) or criticize him as a absolutist
, cruel and reactionary monarch! Can anybody explain? Thank you very much![[User:Ti2008|Ti2008]] ([[User talk:Ti2008|talk]]) 16:10, 3 March 2011 (UTC)

:Why do you assume that it is either one or the other?  [[User:GoetheFromm|GoetheFromm]] ([[User talk:GoetheFromm|talk]]) 18:10, 3 March 2011 (UTC)
::Oh! I have already thought that he may be a national hero (or at least a positive character) in the Islamic Republic of Iran. But I began to wonder at their view about him after reading these passages: ''&quot;The 1971 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire at Persepolis, organized by the Shah's regime, was attacked for its extravagance. &quot;As the foreigners reveled on drink forbidden by Islam, Iranians were not only excluded from the festivities, some were starving.&quot; Five years later the Shah angered pious Iranian Muslims by changing the first year of the Iranian solar calendar from the Islamic hijri to the ascension to the throne by Cyrus the Great&quot;'' (see: [[Islamic Revolution]]) and ''&quot;After the Iranian revolution, the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran&quot;''![[User:Ti2008|Ti2008]] ([[User talk:Ti2008|talk]]) 16:09, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

:::I have to be honest. The Iranian Regime now is an enigma to say the least. On one side they are censoring Achaemenid history from their history books, and attacking him in every fashion possible including vandalism and destruction of Persepolis and all that remains of the cultural signature of the Achaemenids and on the other hand ironically they are suddenly interested in protecting the name of Persian Gulf from Arab investments in Europe and also their attempt to censor Persian Gulf. So the Islamic republic is a paradoxical regime to say the least. Cyrus the Great, is in the view of the majority of the people of Iran a national hero to say the least. There is no dispute on that ground. The Iranian regime however is corrupt, and disorganized and this disorganization shows even in their own agendas. The original &quot;revolutionary&quot; mullahs were anti-Achaemenid because of the attribution that [[Shah of Iran]] made to the &quot;continous picture of monarchy for 2,500 years&quot; and in fact a few of the radical mullahs decided to destroy Persepolis and were only barely stoped by the interim government that felt sorry for 3,000 years of history to go down because of transient sentiment of a few revolutionaries, but it feels as though the Mullahs also have a religious issue with Cyrus the Great since for the most part they consider him to be a Zoroastrian, and having seen the recent clashes between what is essentially a modernly oriented youth of Iran, and their love for their ancient history (for most part, I assure you they are exceptions), and what is in fact a cruel, dictatorship of a regime, I have to say that it is wisest to completely dissociate the Iranian Islamic Republic from people of Iran as one is governed by chaotic, power struggles that result in different outcomes and the other is a cultural, ethnic group. Interestingly, even the Mullahs are not all the same, they have elements that are progressive and culturally oriented and those elements would most be curious about  Dhul- Qarnayn which is the title that a good minoroty of scholars attribute to Cyrus. So for the moment I would have to say we have to treat Cyrus as an important pan-Persian and pan-Iranian figure with major achievements and a signature best seen in his home town , Pars, Persia. That is my opinion anyhow. What you quoted above is mostly all true which should perhaps further the notion that 1)Islamic republic is fickle and 2) that at the moment (last few decades) the conservatives are in power and so they reflect their agendas. I hope that helps a bit :) [[User:Dr. Persi|Dr. Persi]] ([[User talk:Dr. Persi|talk]]) 04:48, 12 May 2011 (UTC)

:::::You are welcomed! Actually the reputation and memory of Cyrus the Great, at least in my view can not be underestimated. He is like the idealogical glue that unites the Iranian people. Cyrus's image is comparable to that of Confucious in China, or Constantine in Rome. In a sense (and this is my belief), what Makes Cyrus stand out is his humility despite his massive power and control. There were and will be many other figures who own empires bigger than him but none of the emperors do the progressive, humanistic things that he does. Even though most of the Persian history is understood in the contenxt of war, and border control, an even bigger part of it is about social interactions such as paying those who work under the king, creation of social structures like postal system, and roads, primitive concept of human rights and allowing the conquered people to practice freely their religious traditions, and an attempt to include, maintain, and incorporate, as opposed to the previous (and later) empire's attempt to obliterate and include. At any rate, reading about this figure has been nothing but joyful for me, and the more I learn about him, even about his errors, and his flaws, the more I am content about his role. In short, he was a simple guy, lived simply, and died simply. Hope you would not mind my little philosophy piece :D [[User:Dr. Persi|Dr. Persi]] ([[User talk:Dr. Persi|talk]]) 04:45, 9 July 2011 (UTC)

== For User Debresser ==

I have studied Achaemenid history for a year now. I can cite you many sources that will distincly state that Cyrus the Great originated from Persis which is the Greek name given to the region to which Persians referred to as Parsua, also equivalent of Fars, which has always been within the Iranian cultural and geopolitical reference. 

Additionally the text which you keep censoring state that &quot;Aside from his own nation Persia (or Persis which is where he is from) in Iran (which is the historical, cultural name of the region of which he hails), he left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion, etc.&quot; This means that he left a cultural signature that defines identity of the people of the Persis (Persia) and that also concurrently his origin. I have written this in conjuction with the earlier authors who made this article, and even in conjuction with experienced editors and admins like Doughweller. You have no right to censor this information or remove sources that are reputable. I am not stating anything that is outside of the historical and established scholarly facts. If you want sources. I will provide it for you. 

All you have done is removed the piece and called it &quot;disputable&quot; without any backing. I do not even see a dispute in the talk page. I hope this clarifies the issue. [[User:Dr. Persi|Dr. Persi]] ([[User talk:Dr. Persi|talk]]) 07:15, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

:I'm not sure what Debresser exact objection is, but the term &quot;nation&quot; may have to used with some care here. The Persian empire was &quot;multinational&quot; or better multi-ethnic state, even without its later western expansion (and so is Iran today). 

:Another I've noted is, please avoid textbooks being &gt;100 years old (in particular for issues of national or ethnic identities), as they often do not reflect they current state of knowledge. Also do not use google search strings as urls. Usually you can provided a short handy url giving direct to the a page in google books, which is much better than a cumbersome long searchstring which impairs the readability of the source text.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 07:28, 29 January 2012 (UTC)
== Lead ==

I removed from the lead the first part of the sentence ''&quot;Aside from his own nation, Persia (modern Iran),'' Cyrus the Great also left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion&quot;. Dr. Persi has reverted me three times, each time adding additional citations. Let me explain why I removed this part of the sentence, and why the sources do not change my position a bit.

# It is quite obvious that '''Cyrus II of Persia''' should have an influence on '''Persia''', and this needs no mention.
# There is no reason to add anything as a preface or introduction to &quot;Cyrus the Great also left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion&quot;, which is a complete and understandable sentence in its own right.
# There is a real problem with the addition &quot;(modern Iran)&quot; to this sentence. If Cyrus the Great had any influence on modern Iran, then that is important enough to warrant its own sentence in the lead, with its own sources. This is not something to be said en passent. In effect, this ''is'' mentioned elsewhere in the lead, and there is no reason to mention it here out of context.

I hope Dr. Persi will now understand the pointe of my edit, and why the sources he added, have no bearing on the issue at all. I would, however, recommend, that he add them as additional sources in other, more appropriate places in this article.

Debresser please do not alter the text accompanying Persis. Persis to Iran is like Athens to Greece.

== Sources &amp; Google book snippets ==

I replaced the 1906 book by a current (well known) scholarly website. Please note that fairly old literature is usually not appropriate in particular if an abundance of more recent scholarly resources are available. Moreover it is usually inappropriate to created WP content based on google snippets. An editor needs to make sure that he is not picking one or two lines from a book without being able to read the surrounding (con)text to assure that he understansd the few snippet lines properly. In practice that means, that it is best not to use snippets at all but rather restricted or full preview only. If you want to provide snippets as a convenience link for disputed content nevertheless, make sure that you've read the full text of you which you cite the snippet elsewhere.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 08:24, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

:Well if you look at the text you removed and replaced with livus.org you will see that it is not a snippet but a page of the book. I am not sure how extensive it is on the pages prior and after the page from which the source is elicited. Anyhow, I would have instead simply added your source on top of the old one instead of replacing the old one with the new one. Also on topics of ancient history an older book say one from 1906 is as valid as one in 1960. Not much is going to change in way of events as all is in the past. Anyhow, I am fine with the substitution. [[User:Dr. Persi|Dr. Persi]] ([[User talk:Dr. Persi|talk]]) 08:28, 29 January 2012 (UTC)
:: '''No''', a 1906 book on an antiquity topic is usually not as valid as a 1960 book, there's a difference of 50 years of research. Now in some cases the knowledge might nor have changed much, but in case other cases it might have changed drastically. Within 50 years a lot of new archeological evidence might be found or scholarly opinions in general simply might have changed. Another thing is that historic research in the 19th and early 20th century did not quite match today's standards/methodology and often comes with a strong national bias. So, to be on the safe side it always better (and the appropriate thing for WP editors) to cite the most recent (or at least some fairly recent) academic literature. I agree however that for this particular content (the use of Messiah) the knowledge has not changed, hence it was that that problematic to cite an older book. However since in the past this article was plagued by outdated and other otherwise questionable references in general, I decided to fix that anyway, in particular to avoid the impression that it might be ok to use such old books to source other more critical content as well.
::The link you originally provided for a book was just a snippet (at least at my location, unfortunately google books visibility may vary geographically).

But once you've done that, what's the point in citing the older instead of the newer one? 
::::Sorry for the bold letters, I didn't mean to offend, but the use of old and problematic sources is common problem in WP (due to their easy availability on google books) with many editors often not being fully aware how problematic that is.

== Return of the exiles ==

I was just looking at Finkelstein and Silberman's book ''The Bible Unearthed'' in response to a query about the Babylonian Exile (for which they find archaeological evidence but no extra-biblical evidence, although they don't query it, and found (p 308):

&quot;From Kings to Priests

The edict of Cyrus the Great allowing a group of Judahite exiles io return to Jerusalem could hardly have been prompted by sympathy for the people remaining in Judah or for the suffering of the exiles. Rather, it should be seen as a well-calculated policy that aimed to serve the interests of the Persian empire. The Persians tolerated and even promoted local cults as a way to ensure the loyalty of local groups to the wider empire; both Cyrus and his son Cambyses supported the building of temples and encouraged the return of displaced populations elsewhere in their vast empire. Their policy was to grant autonomy to loyal local elites.

Many scholars agree that the Persian Icings encouraged the rise of a loyal elite in Yehud, because of the provinces strategic and sensitive location on the border of Egypt. This loyal elite was recruited from the Jewish exile community in Babylonia and was led by dignitaries who were closely connected to the Persian administration. They were mainly individuals of high social and economic status, families who had resisted assimilation and who were most probably close to the Deuteronomistic ideas. Though the returnees were a minority in Yehud, their religious, socioeconomic, and political status, and their concentration in and around Jerusalem, gave them power far beyond their number.&quot;

A short mention of this seems appropriate. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 10:05, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

== Disputable claim about human rights in Cyrus Cylinder ==

The first paragraph of the article claims the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] contained a declaration of human rights.  However, Wikipedia's article on the Cyrus Cylinder appears to dispute that claim: ''The Cylinder has also been claimed to be an early &quot;human rights charter&quot;, though the British Museum and a number of scholars of the ancient Near Eastern history reject this view as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature.''

See [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Lester+L+Grabbe%2C&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=authenticity+decree+cyrus&amp;oq=authenticity+decree+cyrus&amp;gs_l=serp.3...3975.9994.1.10339.29.20.2.7.7.0.176.1719.16j4.20.0...0.0...1c.1._WBMQFI_xV8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=3d47eca5624272e6&amp;bpcl=39650382&amp;biw=1288&amp;bih=578] for a start.

== Diletant Pahlavist propaganda ==

Issue:
:''After the [[Iranian revolution]], the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the [[Sivand Dam]] on river Polvar (located in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]) and flooding, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. This has nonetheless, caused a petition to be drafted to the U.N. demanding protection of this historical entity.''
I've removed this part because it's nothing but diletant propaganda by apologists of former regime. Tomb of Cyrus isn't isolated case, you can find similar nonsenses about &quot;attempts of bulldozing Persepolis&quot;, &quot;plans for destroying Cyrus cylinder&quot;, etc. &lt;u&gt;None&lt;/u&gt; of such claims are supported either by reliable sources (try Iranica) or UNESCO. This is what J. Lendering says about this specific issue:
:''The report that the Iranian authorities will endanger the site of Pasargadae by building a dam in the Sivand, which has often surfaced in the blogosphere and probably is a hoax, was repeated on the CAIS website with a remark that &quot;Iran's pre-Islamic past and Iranians' non-Islamic-national-identity and heritage have always been the subjects of abhorrence for the clerics. This diabolical plot by Ayatollahs in Tehran was set in motion in 1979 to destroy and erase all pre-Islamic Iranian past from the consciousness of the Iranian nation as part of their de-Iranianisation campaign.&quot; This is sheer innuendo.''&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.livius.org/opinion/opinion0012.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

== [[Cyrus the Great in the Quran]] ==

I think that we should relocate the sentence which includes ' the Qur'anic figure of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] is Cyrus the Great' to the first paragraph of the article. I see that Cyrus's mention in Jewish Bible is placed in fist paragraph. Anyone agree? &lt;span style=&quot;color:#b61b25&quot;&gt;elmasmelih (&lt;small&gt;used to be KazekageTR&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 18:38, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
: The idea behind this proposal is fine. Just that there is the complication that the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn and Cyrus the Great is not agreed upon by all, and I think if we place this in the lead, it should be done in a way that clarifies this. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 19:06, 15 April 2014 (UTC)
::I'm pretty sure it is a fringe theory.  Which reliable sources even affirm this identification?  The ''Blackwell Companion to the Qur'ān'' says: &quot;Dhū'l-Qarnayn, an epithet usually assigned to Alexander the Great but also attributed to Moses by Muslim as well as Jewish and Christian exegetes.&quot; (Wheeler, p. 260).  The Brill ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', second edition says &quot;It is generally agreed both by Muslim commentators and modéra occidental scholars that D̲h̲u ’l-Ḳarnayn, “the two-horned”, in Sūra XVIII, 83/82-98 is to be identified with Alexander the Great.&quot; (Watt, &quot;al-Iskandar&quot;).  The third edition says &quot;Dhū al-Qarnayn (usually identified with Alexander the Great)&quot; (Cook, &quot;Gog and Magog&quot;). The Brill ''Encyclopedia of the Qurʾān'' says &quot;Traditional and modern scholars have identified the figure the Qurʾān refers to as the Possessor of the Two Horns (Dhū l-Qarnayn, q 18:83, 86, 94) as Alexander the Great (al-Iskandar in Arabic).&quot; (Renard, &quot;Alexander&quot;).

== King of Aryavarta? ==

The infobox boldly claims that Cyrus is/was referred to as &quot;King of Aryavarta&quot;, a region comprising modern Pakistan ''and'' a lot of Northern India. From what I understand, the Achaemenid Empire did not stretch much past the Indus making this claim rather odd. The references cited are not reliable either. [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a0IF9IdkdYEC One] makes no mention of Aryavarta at all. The [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=am3XAAAAMAAJ other] does (in a snippet view) mention Aryavarta once, but with nothing about any Kings of Aryavarta. This claim appears to be quite baseless. Any comments? --[[User:Cpt.a.haddock|Cpt.a.haddock]] ([[User talk:Cpt.a.haddock|talk]]) 18:49, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

== Purpose of Etymology ==

What is the purpose of the etymology section? Why does the origin and study of his name belong in an article on the person?

== ERA war  ==

An unregistered editor has been joined by two registered editors, {{U|Debresser}} and {{U|JudeccaXIII}} in what appears to be violation of the [[WP:ERA]] guideline. As far as I can tell from history, the article originally used AD/BC format. There was a brief period of edit warring in mid-2005 along with several talk page sections. No consensus for change to BCE/CE seems to have been reached, and the article has been fairly stable in the use of BC/AD since then. There ''may'' be good reasons to change the format; there is no good reason to do so without discussion and consensus. [[Special:Contributions/2600:1006:B129:A994:B945:D20A:9451:85D|2600:1006:B129:A994:B945:D20A:9451:85D]] ([[User talk:2600:1006:B129:A994:B945:D20A:9451:85D|talk]]) 23:40, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

::Maybe you should go back and check the definition of consensus.

::::Thank you. That is not to say, however, that it needs to be a closed subject. Consensus ''can'' change, as long as proper processes are followed. By my reading, the 2005 discussion treated the original author's choice as cast in stone and the BCE/CE style a U.S. academia affectation. I'm not sure either view has a lot of support currently.
::::On a related note, a recent edit prompted me to look at [[Cyrus the Great in the Bible]], which seems to be closely enough coupled to this article to be included in any Era discussion we decide to have here.

:::::We should deal with this on the specific merits of the individual article in question. You're right that we don't treat the original author's choice as cast in stone, nor the BCE style as an academic affectation. I can see no good reason to keep this at BC/AD, it isn't a Christian-related article. [[User:Doug Weller|Doug Weller]] ([[User talk:Doug Weller|talk]]) 06:16, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::: As opposed to [[Cyrus the Great in the Bible]], which is a religion-related article. This article also mentions Cyrus in relationship to the Old Testament, even in the lead, but that is obviously a minor point in this article.

:::::: I don't follow your logic, Doug. Why do you think that only Christian-related articles should use BC/AD? Do you think that only Norse pagan-related articles should use [[Thursday]]? That only Roman pagan-related articles should use [[January]]? [[User:Crumpled Fire|Crumpled Fire]] ([[User talk:Crumpled Fire|talk]]) 11:11, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::I can see good reasons for Christian-related articles to use BC/AD although on the other hand some Christian theologians do not. The same might go for articles on pop music although the reasons there wouldn't relate to religion. You've misunderstood me in any case. There's no religious reason for this article to use a Christian era style is what I meant. [[User:Doug Weller|Doug Weller]] ([[User talk:Doug Weller|talk]]) 14:23, 31 August 2015 (UTC)

== Messiah ==

The article claims that Cyrus was the only non-Jew to be called Messiah (or anointed one), but the source cited in support of the claim doesn't say that. Rather it says that Cyrus was the only non-Jew to be called Yahweh's Messiah. There is a vital difference. The cited source goes on to point out that others have been called Messiah, including the Aramean king Hazel (who was non-Jew). But Cyrus is still the only non-Jew to be specifically referred to as Yahweh's Messiah (or His Messiah). It is incorrect for the article to state that Cyrus was the only non-Jew to be called Messiah, and it is unsupported by the cited source. That passage in the article will have to get &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fv}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag because the cited source doesn't support it, or it gets rewritten to fit what the cited source says. Of course, other sources could be brought forward to further clarify things. [[User:EyeTruth|EyeTruth]] ([[User talk:EyeTruth|talk]]) 22:39, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
: Yyou should be more careful when interpreting your sources. Hazel is not called &quot;anointed&quot;! Hazel was anointed king, meaning that Elijah poured oil on him. Those are two different things altogether.
: Now, regarding Cyrus. The verse says &quot;Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus&quot;. So Cyrus is called &quot;meshicho&quot; = &quot;His anointed&quot;. He is not called &quot;the anointed of YHWH&quot;. The difference is small, but is there. Compare Moses, who is yes called &quot;[[servant of God]]&quot;, not just &quot;his servant&quot;.
: The reason I insist on this small difference and call it important, is because otherwise &quot;YHWH's anointed&quot; will become a title for Cyrus, and that would be incorrect. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 06:16, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

::In other words you're comparing the primary source (i.e. Bible) against the other source (the webpage). But then it's this other source, and not the Bible, that is cited for that passage in the article. Like I already stated on your talkpage, my primary goal here is to make sure that passage in the article agrees with what the source cited for it asserts. The text of the cited source starts out by listing Cyrus as one of the many people that have been associated with ''mashiah'' and its other grammatical forms, and it included Hazel in that list. Up to that point, nothing in the cited source says Cyrus is the only non-Jew to be associated with ''mashiah''. The source then goes on to specially single out Cyrus as the only non-Jew to be referred to as &quot;YHWH’s messiah&quot;, and continues to heavily emphasize this unique distinction throughout. Now, whether that is correct or not, you be the judge. But the main problem here is that what the article says is inconsistent with what the source is saying. This is a [[WP:INTEGRITY]] issue. Since you already said you consider that webpage unreliable, then shouldn't finding a more reliable source be the next course of action? [[User:EyeTruth|EyeTruth]] ([[User talk:EyeTruth|talk]]) 07:18, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

::: Again, the webpage does not say that Hazel is called &quot;the anointed&quot;, of whomever, just that he was anointed.
::: We seem to agree that the source, however reliable it may be, is guilty of paraphrasing. That said, I am not disputing that Cyrus is the only non-Jew who has been called &quot;His anointed&quot;.
::: Another question is how important this specific distinction is. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 13:46, 30 July 2015 (UTC)
::::In other words, if we're to follow your explanation which is based directly on the original source, then the cited source is clearly very problematic with the assertion it tries to forcefully push forward. Something needs to be done about it then, because that passage belies what its cited source firmly proposes. About Hazel, he was only associated with the term but not called anyone's anointed.

::::: Indeed. I don't know what is the best way to resolve this problem. The source is clear. On the other hand, the source expresses this idea with the wrong words. Frankly speaking, I think the old version explains it well enough. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 21:50, 30 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::Which version? This piece of information is naturally striking, so there should be an abundance of reliable sources that attest to it. [[User:EyeTruth|EyeTruth]] ([[User talk:EyeTruth|talk]]) 03:54, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::: The version I reverted back to, the present version.
::::::: I agree with your argument, and think that the fact that there aren't many such sources proves my point. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 09:40, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
::::::: Oh ok. There has to be better sources that don't make bogus claims; that's what I meant. But I haven't looked into sources yet. [[User:EyeTruth|EyeTruth]] ([[User talk:EyeTruth|talk]]) 21:31, 1 August 2015 (UTC)
