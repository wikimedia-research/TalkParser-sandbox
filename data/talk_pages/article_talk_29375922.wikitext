[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia, one or more of the [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] you added  do not comply with our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines for external links]] and have been removed. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used as a platform for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion, and doing so is contrary to the goals of this project. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the article's talk page before reinserting it. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia.
