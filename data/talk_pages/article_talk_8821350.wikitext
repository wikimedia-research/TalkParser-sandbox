{{#if:{{{header|}}}|=={{{header-text|Notability of [[:1605munro]]}}}==}}
A tag has been placed on [[:1605munro]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page and leave a note on [[Talk:1605munro|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  --[[User:Onorem|Onorem]] 13:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
==License tagging for Image:Munro22.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Munro22.jpg]]. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
* [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
* [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]]. If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 14:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
