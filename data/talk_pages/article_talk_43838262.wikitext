[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Wtmitchell|Wtmitchell]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/83.110.19.116|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uzbekistan&amp;diff=625802316 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Uzbekistan]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Wtmitchell|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Wtmitchell|Wtmitchell]]  [[User talk:Wtmitchell|(talk)]] &lt;small&gt;(earlier ''Boracay Bill'')&lt;/small&gt; 12:08, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
