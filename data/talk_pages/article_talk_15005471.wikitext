==Added a link to Metisse==
Added a link to [[Metisse]], another '2.5D' windowing system, in part similar to Looking Glass&lt;br /&gt;
[http://youtube.com/watch?v=dxsUKX6xXyE Metisse on GNU/Linux demo]&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone interested in writing more on this? :)&lt;br /&gt;

==Fair use rationale for Image:LG3D memo board.jpeg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:LG3D memo board.jpeg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:LG3D memo board.jpeg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

== Another Project Looking Glass ==

[[David Wilcock]] reveals in [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4951448613711060908 a March 2008 presentation] at the Los Angeles Airport Hilton Hotel another Project Looking Glass which has to do with emulating on a large scale the function of the [[pineal gland]] in functioning as a conduit between our spacetime reality and the inverted timespace reality of dreaming and out-of-body experiences etc. I'm just mentioning this in this space so that as more information on this aggregates it might be material for a new article at some point. __[[User:Meco|meco]] ([[User talk:Meco|talk]]) 08:21, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:[[Chronovisor]] appears to be something in that same field of endeavor. __[[User:Meco|meco]] ([[User talk:Meco|talk]]) 10:46, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

== use of despite? ==

Second paragraph, looks wrongly worded --[[Special:Contributions/86.139.158.206|86.139.158.206]] ([[User talk:86.139.158.206|talk]]) 15:12, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

== Compiz etc. ==

I reworded the Compiz promotion to explain its irrelevance as opposed to merely deleting it. Hope no-one minds. [[Special:Contributions/144.138.186.163|144.138.186.163]] ([[User talk:144.138.186.163|talk]]) 12:15, 16 September 2008 (UTC)

== Croquet? ==

How about a brief mention of the Croquet Project in the Similar Projects sections?

== Still in development? ==
Does anyone know if this project is still in development? All I can find on offivial and unofficial pages is quite some years old and the svn repository is closed (perhaps just for the moment, don't know) - even their developer blog (http://projectlookingglass3d.blogspot.com/ ) has the last entry from 2006. So I really wonder if it's still und development.--[[Special:Contributions/88.134.42.52|88.134.42.52]] ([[User talk:88.134.42.52|talk]]) 18:05, 14 April 2009 (UTC)


Agreed, if any insider or someone in the know has heard, is this project alive at all? Last release is nearly two years ago... Shame, it looked quite interesting. [[Special:Contributions/80.0.208.78|80.0.208.78]] ([[User talk:80.0.208.78|talk]]) 18:58, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

:If nothing else, we should surely delete the &quot;and since then has gathered momentum in development&quot; line, since it appears to be untrue. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 22:38, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== Clash with Steve Jobs ==

I came to this page via a link about how Steve Jobs tried to sue the creator of the Looking Glass project...&lt;br /&gt;
...So maybe something about that should be mentioned and referenced.

The link is from the creator's web log - good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal by jonathan schwartz[http://jonathanischwartz.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/]
