[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Agtx|Agtx]]. Wikipedia is written by people who have a wide diversity of opinions, but we try hard to make sure articles have a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. Your recent edit to [[:Anti-Catholicism in the United States]] seemed less than neutral to me, so I removed it for now. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Agtx|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-npov-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-npov1 --&gt;[[User:Agtx|Agtx]] ([[User talk:Agtx|talk]]) 18:20, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
