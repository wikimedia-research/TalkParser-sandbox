==Welcome to Wikipedia. But...==
...I've added the &quot;{{[[Template:prod|prod]]}}&quot; template to your user page ([[User:Mrmcminn]]), suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]). 

Please note that the purpose of a user page is not as personal homepage or [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|used as a general webhosting service]], but as way for active '''editors''' of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. If you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues here or on my user talk page. You may remove the deletion notice, and the page will not be deleted for the moment, but note that it may still be sent to [[Wikipedia: Miscellany for deletion|Miscellany for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached, or if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]]. 

If you wish to contribute directly to Wikipedia and your page has already been deleted, you can ask any admin to undelete and restore it: if necessary, leave me a message and I'll pass on your request. To begin editing, here are some pages that you might find helpful:
