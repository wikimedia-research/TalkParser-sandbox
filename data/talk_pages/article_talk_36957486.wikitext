==A minor point==
Does Wikipedia call the War in Afghanistan a &quot;War&quot; or a &quot;Conflict?&quot; I also think it should be '[whatever] in Afghanistan' not &quot;Afghan&quot;.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 15:16, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:I wikilinked it to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] as this seemed most appropriate.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:19, 9 September 2012 (UTC)

== Image ==

I have just uploaded [[:File:Geograph 3107918 Briidgwater War Memoiral.jpg]] to commons which is a closer view of the memorial (with poppies etc.) which may be more appropriate for this article.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:I agree (typographical and spelling aside). Or we could have both? What do you think? Nice picture, BTW. The current picture is good for orientation, but the newer picture should be in the infobox, I think. Nevertheless, I defer to your judgment.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 15:57, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
::I think the closer one is better for this article (if it were about the square I would go with the wider shot). I don't think there is room for both (yet) - but what do you mean by typographical &amp; spelling aside?&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:02, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:::Your file name was misspelled. &quot;Briidgwater War Memoiral.jpg&quot; Its not important to me, but it could be important to someone trying to find it. [[Don't worry, be happy]]. No worries.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 16:08, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
::::That is why I like having an editor. We don't even see it when we do it. Computers have made me faster, but they have not made me more accurate.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 16:10, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::Ooops I see what you mean now - I have requested a move on commons to the correct spelling.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:21, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::Pic now moved on commons &amp; put into the article.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:10, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
Assuming we are doing a [[WP:DYK]], a cropped version would be better for use on the main page, I think. I've seen it done for other articles.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:11, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:I gave up DYK years ago - but good luck.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:49, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
::I understand; sometimes it can be very difficult. But I'll handle it. You'll be listed as a contributor of course. Not a [[zero sum game]].  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:53, 9 September 2012 (UTC)
:::I'm envisioning this as a triple DYK, including the two war memorials and John Angel. Need a hook line.  &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#060&quot;&gt;7&amp;amp;6=thirteen&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:7&amp;amp;6=thirteen|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;☎&lt;/b&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 18:10, 9 September 2012 (UTC)

==DYK Nomination==
I have nominated [[John Angel (sculptor)]]. I intend to do a [[treble hook]] [[WP:DYK]], but have not yet formulated a suitable hook line. I will also be nominating anon the [[Exeter War Memorial]] and the [[Bridgwater War Memorial]], both of which he designed. Both are new articles.  I would like to treat this as a [[treble hook]]. Any suggestions as to wording for an appropriate hook would be appreciated.
