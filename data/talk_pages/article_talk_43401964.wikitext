== Hornblower episode articles ==

Hi! Thank you for your Hornblower episode articles.

Here's a tip: When you want to create a new article on Wikipedia, you need to establish if the topic is notable enough to have its own article. For articles on TV series episodes in particular, see here: [[WP:EPISODE]].

In order to establish notability, you need to present reliable sources. See here: [[WP:RELIABLE]]. Currently I see no references in your Hornblower articles, so I can't be convinced of their notability. Please add some references to avoid the articles from being deleted ([[WP:DELETE]]).

[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Hello, Joshuawells123. Your recent contributions, such as [[Hornblower duty]] appear to consist primarily of [[WP:PLOT|plot summary]]. Wikipedia articles should not consist primarily of such description. You may want to read the [[WP:PLOTSUM|plot summary edit guides]] to learn more about contributing. Thanks, and happy editing, [[User:Cnilep|Cnilep]] ([[User talk:Cnilep|talk]]) 23:43, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
