== Babette Rosmond â€Ž ==

Since you are related to the subject of the article, I am not going to dispute your additions to [[Babette Rosmond]]. However I do ask that you don't place your additions in front of pre-existing footnotes which do not contain the information you are adding, or worse, directly contradict what you are adding.  I can assist you if you need help with this.  Thank you.
