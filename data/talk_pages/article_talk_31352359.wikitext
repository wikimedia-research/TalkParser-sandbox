A tag has been placed on [[:Satnam Singh]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Satnam Singh|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Satnam Singh|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Catfish Jim and the soapdish|&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#006633&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catfish&amp;nbsp;Jim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Catfish Jim and the soapdish|&lt;small&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#339966&quot;&gt;''&amp;#38;&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;soapdish''&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:39, 31 March 2011 (UTC)
