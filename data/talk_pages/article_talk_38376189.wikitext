== American English v. Other varieties ==

I have seen this issue come up in at least one other article on Wikipedia India related articles. I would prefer to keep the current American English despite this post from [[User:Ucucha]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThird_Anglo-Maratha_War%2FGA1&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=386390692&amp;oldid=386383575]. Reasons:

* The article is fairly evolved and currently undergoing a GA review
* As far as I know, most Indian users may prefer American English. I know for a fact that most Indian users have their browsers and word processing tools set to American English when it comes to spell check and other preferences. [[User:Zuggernaut|Zuggernaut]] ([[User talk:Zuggernaut|talk]]) 21:51, 22 September 2010 (UTC)
**The first point is irrelevant; that an article is developed is no excuse for it not following the Manual of Style. The second point is more interesting. I would have expected Indian English to use British, or Commonwealth, spellings, and [[Indian English#Idioms and popular words/phrases]] says the same. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 22:02, 22 September 2010 (UTC)

::Here's what the MoS says about an evolved/developed article: [[Wikipedia:TIES#Retaining_the_existing_variety]].
::I am not aware of any dictionary specifically made for &quot;Indian English&quot;, at least not from any reputed publishing house. Indian English in itself may have numerous varieties depending on the state you are in. For Maharashtra, the state of relevance in this article, according to the Wikipedia article you point to, this would be &quot;Minglish&quot;. This falls under [[WP:OR]]. &lt;s&gt;Many or most&lt;/s&gt;Some of the sources used in that article will not pass [[WP:Reliable|reliable sources]] test but there is a lot of original research in that article. [[User:Zuggernaut|Zuggernaut]] ([[User talk:Zuggernaut|talk]]) 22:20, 22 September 2010 (UTC)
::I see this as a minor point but I am willing to change to British English if the majority feel so. My preference is American English. [[User:Zuggernaut|Zuggernaut]] ([[User talk:Zuggernaut|talk]]) 22:20, 22 September 2010 (UTC)
:::If you want to go with American English, all the dates will have to be changed as they use the British style (I changed them under the assumption that an article about India would use British English). I favour British English for the article as the British have strong national ties to India. See [[Wikipedia:MOS#Strong national ties to a topic]]. --[[User:Diannaa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:teal;&quot;&gt;Diannaa&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Diannaa|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 02:26, 23 September 2010 (UTC)
::::I noticed there's a template for Indian English - &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Indian English}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; so I think it makes sense to switch to that version since this article had a lot of India-specific terminology like &quot;lakh&quot; for 100,000, Appa ''Saheb'', Peshwa, etc and also because are similarities in the spellings in British and Indian English.

== EIC troops, numbers, label ==

EIC troops numbered about 150,000 for our time period of interest per the link provided in the GA review ([[Company rule in India#Army and civil service]]). Also, they are almost universally referred to as British in literature, even though they were of Indian nationality hired by EIC. Some times, particularly when giving casualties/number of dead, a distinction is made by several authors in stating that x number of dead were European, rest were Indian. [[User:Zuggernaut|Zuggernaut]] ([[User talk:Zuggernaut|talk]]) 16:01, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

:This is a hard one they were employed by the EIC a British trading company and most accounts use British to describe them even when about 80%+ were Indians. We could use company troops which is accurate and gets around the problem of race.--[[User:Jim Sweeney|Jim Sweeney]] ([[User talk:Jim Sweeney|talk]]) 11:47, 25 September 2010 (UTC)
::I have changed all references to &quot;East India Company troops&quot; [[User:Zuggernaut|Zuggernaut]] ([[User talk:Zuggernaut|talk]]) 06:23, 26 September 2010 (UTC)

== What are 'Jahirnama' and 'farman'? ==

These terms are used in the penultimate paragraph of the 'Flight of the Peshwa' section. Although it seems obvious that they are some kind of edict, it might be useful to have them formally defined.[[User:1812ahill|1812ahill]] ([[User talk:1812ahill|talk]]) 17:56, 19 December 2012 (UTC)

== Problems with 'Events in Napur' section. ==

1: [[Raja Mansingh]] links to an article about someone who died in 1614. Clearly not the same fellow standing surety for Appu Sabeh in the 19th century.
2: Appu Sabeh is stated to have died in 1849 aged 44. That would place his birth year in 1805. Yet he murdered his cousin and signed a treaty with the British in 1816 aged 11? Surely that can't be right?
