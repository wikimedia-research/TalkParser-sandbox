==QUOTE FROM WIKIPROJECT ODM==
Non-English language awards
The basic rule is that the names of foreign-language awards should be translated into English except where there is an established track-record of referring to it by its foreign-language name. Therefore we use Iron Cross in favour of &quot;Eiserne Kreuz&quot;, Pour le MÃ©rite in favour of &quot;For the Merit&quot; or &quot;Merit Award&quot;, and Param Vir Chakra in favour of &quot;Bravest of the Brave Award&quot;. This effectively means that the article will reside at the customary English-language name. Having said this, editors are encouraged to create redirects for all reasonable permutations and variations on the name, whether in English or in the native language.

:There is no such record of referring to this award by its French name, the title was thus translated into English and should remain as such.  [[User:Fdutil|Fdutil]] ([[User talk:Fdutil|talk]]) 17:32, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
