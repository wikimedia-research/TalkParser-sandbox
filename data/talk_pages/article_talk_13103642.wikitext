== Improving Asperger syndrome article ==

I just quickly scanned [[Asperger syndrome]] and you're right, it could stand improvement. I'm afraid I won't have time in the next few weeks to do anything major. Do you have anything in mind? I could just write a quick review of the whole page, sort of a kneejerk reaction, if you think that'd help, and put it on the talk page.

Before doing major work, what do you see as the priorities in this area? I just now looked at (and reorganized a bit) [[List of autism-related topics]]. Wow. It's enormous. [[User:Eubulides|Eubulides]] 18:22, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:I REALLY do see your point, but at the same time, if you are going to tag the article again, you really DO need to explain exactly what inaccuracies you see in the citations etc. I know it is a pain, but &quot;guess the inaccuracy&quot; is a game that could take for ever to play.

:Wherever there are inaccuracies I am 100% with you, but I have a slow connection, clinical shock ($800!!! YIKES!!) and houseguests at the weekend, so help me out here and specify the inaccuracies?? --[[User:Zeraeph|Zeraeph]] 00:38, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== Task force for [[WP:MED]] ==

I'm hoping for some help from someone familiar with WikiProject Medicine. I would like to create a Pregnancy and Childbirth Task Force. Does WP:MED have any task forces? Would I be better off creating a child (no pun intended) WikiProject? I'd rather avoid the bureaucracy involved in that if possible. I would appreciate any guidance. If you know of a person better able to help me, feel free to steer me that way. (I first tried [[User:Eubulides]], who suggested I contact you.)

== Sandbox goof ==

Sorry, Sandy!  I wasn't planning to &quot;promote&quot; [[Fun Home]] myself — I was just trying to see if I could get {{tl|ArticleHistory}} to work to combine the existing GA, peer review and FAC templates on [[Talk:Fun Home]].  I eventually decided to wait until the FAC closes, but didn't want to lose the info about the &quot;oldid&quot; fields, so thought I'd keep it in my sandbox for now.  I didn't realize that would cause problems.

Does the FAC closrue bot automatically change the templates to {{tl|ArticleHistory}}?  If so, that's cool.  If not, I'll make the necessary changes after the FAC closes (however it closes). —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:19, 16 August 2007 (UTC)
:No problem!  Yes, the bot updates articlehistory, and more (there's archiving of the FAC, clearing the old fac file, updating Project assessments, and tagging the FAC closed); best to let the bot do it all once the FAC closes.

== Blanking frenzy at the Alexithymia page ==

Sandy, do you know of a way to stop Zeraeph from going on a &quot;blanking rage&quot; on the alexithymia page? I deleted an unreferenced sentence of his (the contentious one) and in return Zeraeph is blanking huge portions of the reference paragraphs as &quot;not fully referenced&quot;. Is there some rule against that kind of blanking frenzy, or is it a matter of following him and restoring each point he blanks? 

PS. I know you've got your hands full with the goings on at the AS page (where you are proposing some very worthwhile corrections!), but thought I'd run it by you. [[User:Soulgany101|Soulgany101]] 02:54, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
:I see the article has been protected by an admin, so I'm not going to look further tonight; I'm disgusted enough about what went on at [[Asperger syndrome]], and I'm up to my eyeballs right now editing another article, where I can be of more use.  When things get heated, it's time to move on to another area of Wiki for a while. You may know that Zeraeph was upset by a car accident today, so leaving this for another day may be a wise course.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 02:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I understand. Maybe Zeraeph was going through something personal. I won't conjecture more but will say I'm pleased that the article was locked from further blanking. BTW, I note that Zeraeph has a problem with the way the references/citations are written, which may account for the blanking. I thought you had fixed most of that? Anyways, I've got nothing more to add to that article, and I think its in pretty good shape.... certainly the most comprehensive and well-referenced effort for that entry to date. Thanks again for all your tidying, I hope your work remains intact. I'm drifting away from that entry now too to work on more productive projects, as I suspect that Zeraeph would try and vandalize any effort at clean-up I attempted.  [[User:Soulgany101|Soulgany101]] 04:18, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:On the other hand, maybe he should spend more time trying to fix his own refs rather than expecting you to do it for him? --[[User:Zeraeph|Zeraeph]] 04:22, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

Please don't brawl on my talk page; tomorrow's a new, hopefully better day.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 04:46, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== Editing contibution ==

== Oh boy ==

I'm still pretty shakey today, but, after &quot;settling my nerves&quot;, with a little &quot;Australian Nerve Tonic&quot; I KNOW I jumped to some conclusions, some of them were remarkably good, but some were...er...UNgood. Thanks for understanding. 

I really DID flip at the appearance of surname + date (only) cites. [[User:Soulgany101|Soulgany101]] can be a bit slap happy with things like refs (he's new, and some of the citation formats ARE like crochet wearing boxing gloves). I have tidied up after him before, no problem, I just couldn't understand why he was refusing to explain what was going on to let me do that and was taking some kind of offensive instead.

Of course I now realise I was probably misunderstanding and wiping out the work I asked you to do myself, which I am REALLY sorry about, that must have seemed crazy, but I have honestly never seen citations done that way before.

Anyway, I think you will find that the AS editors have come to terms with your concerns and are happy to discuss them now. --[[User:Zeraeph|Zeraeph]] 14:35, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Trickle Down Economics&quot; ==

Sandy the coverage of Trickle Down Economics in the Reagan article is just fine - what do you think, and why was that user on the FAC page so adamantly oppsed to it?

== Publisher for newspapers ==

Hi Sandy, got a question for you.  I noticed that you added publisher information to many of the citations used in [[Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering]].  Some of the ones you added were for ''The Digital Collegian'', which, while it is Penn State's student newspaper, it is run independently of the university, much like a local newspaper would.  Should Penn State still be listed as the publisher in that case?  For example, what would you put for the publisher of the work ''New York Times''? --[[User:Spangineer|Spangineer]]&lt;sup&gt;[[:wikisource:User:Spangineer|ws]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Spangineer|(háblame)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 02:15, 19 August 2007 (UTC)
:Work vs. Publisher has never been well defined (to me, at least) in the cite templates, so I may have gotten them backwards from the way you're using them in the article.  I wouldn't worry too much about what to put; I just wanted something to be there so readers would have an idea where the info came from.  I always put newspapers as publisher and don't really know what to do with Work, but I could be doing it wrong, so whatever you want to do ...

== More Reagan FAC ==

Hi again Sandy. Sorry to keep bothering you about the Reagan FAC, but I have to get your opinion. There are 10 supports and really only one serious opposition (from [[User:Wikipediatoperfection]]). I was reading on the [[WP:FAC]] page and it said that the editors need to come to a concensus. Does this mean that even with 10 suports the article stands a good chance of not passing because of Wikipediatoperfection and he/she is still thinking that there is POV everywhere? [[User:Happyme22|Happyme22]] 21:11, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:That really depends on how Raul reads the consensus and whether he deems the remaining opposes are significant.  All you can do is respond to the best of your ability to the opposes, and wait to see how it develops.  The POV-pushing Opposes are apparent, but that's what an FA will attract; it's up to Raul to decide if they're worthy.  I think the best suggestion so far has been that the article should use more scholarly sources; if I were you, I'd go get those recommended books and start using them for citations.  I'd help, but I'm up to my eyeballs trying so salvage [[Asperger syndrome]], which is a trainwreck featured article.

The whole government denies or obscures crime statistics, they explain the most stupid things (they compare one weekend with another and see what weekend last year had a higher crime than this year and then choose both weekends to show how crime has &quot;dropped&quot;...

Are you going to forever bring up the [[Hugo Chavez]] thing, completely over-looking ALL my photographic contributions?  I asked you about this[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;diff=103895422&amp;oldid=103891378 before] and I thought we had come to some sort of understanding on the issue, yet you bring it up again and I have no idea why.  It completely ignores my contributions, and that I had a good faith argument that I still believe in for the Hugo Chavez page, it just wasn't particularly important to me to pursue.  It would be nice if you &quot;let it go&quot; since it was a year ago, my photography is considered pretty valuable by most editors (apparently not by you) and since I felt I had an argument on the Chavez photo that was meritorious, but not worth pursuing.

== AS table ==

Formatted perfectly, as far as I can see! I do wish people would distinguish between multisentence and single-sentence lists (as you've done here in the formatting—MOS needs a little fixing in this respect). There are variations—adding a semicolon after the first five points (very optional, and I'm starting not to do it for aesthetic reasons), and &quot;, and&quot; at the end of Point 5 (also very optional). 

I'm concerned about &quot;delay in language&quot;.  Shouldn't &quot;development&quot; be added, just as in Point 5? Is DSM-IV quoted here ''verbatim'' (there are no quote marks to indicate that)? I'd be inclined to paraphrase via that addition—it would be a fault on their part not to.

My nerdy editor friends insist on a dot after &quot;et al.&quot;. Personally, I prefer no italics, but many house styles (in influential APA included) insist on it. 

I'll have a look at &quot;History&quot; tonight—daytime is busy at the moment, and, oh, Manderson's back at MOSNUM, so I guess I'll have to spend time fixing things. [[User:Tony1|Tony]] 02:41, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

==Postage stamps of Ireland==
I noticed an edit that [[User:Ms2ger|Ms2ger]] made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postage_stamps_of_Ireland&amp;diff=151572528&amp;oldid=151557111 here] and asked whether removing the en dashes and em dashes that were replaced still complied with MOS. The answer was that the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;ndash;&lt;/code&gt; was changed to &lt;code&gt;–&lt;/code&gt;. I don't know if this complies or not as I had never seen this coding before. Please let me know if this is ok as you seem to know this stuff well. To me it looks like the hyphens that I was told to replace with dashes to comply with MOS during the FAC. [[User:Ww2censor|ww2censor]] 03:02, 22 August 2007 (UTC)
:The endashes and emdashes were merely replaced with real endashes and emdashes; they aren't hyphens. It's just a different way of doing the same thing.  When you're in edit mode, look at the line below the edit summary box that begins with '''Insert'''; the first thing there is an endash and the second is an emdash.  You can click on them to insert a real en or emdash without having to type out the HTML code.

I began worrying about cites one time, after I posted a link to a study in the talk section of one article. After awhile, it didn't work anymore. I found out when I returned to it and someone else commented that it didn't work, so I had to write to them to find out what the new link was. I began wondering if we need to periodically check links. Or in articles, ask the source if a given site is going to be a persistent one, without going to archives or something.

A statement of fact, &quot;rm colloquialisms and errors introduced by editor so-and-so&quot; is not against the WP etiquette. Note that I did not write, &quot;rm stupid colloquialisms&quot;. Nor I ever doubted that the edits were done in good faith. As a matter of fact I left the reasonable edits (about a half) stand. The problem was that another half of them was outlandish. E.g. the editor in question replaced &quot;approximately&quot; by &quot;roughly&quot; and &quot;because&quot; by &quot;so&quot;, which is a violation of WP guidelines recommending formal style. If you make a dozen of such edits you should expect your name mentioned. Regards[[User:Paul gene|Paul gene]] 03:12, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

::OK, that PMID is a good one, but there's a further problem that needs to be sorted out.  Is the tic exacerbation natural waxing and waning, or is it truly due to the med?  It needs to be placed in the context of subsequent research showing that stimulants don't exacerbate tics any more than placebo does.  I'm not certain that has been sorted out on bupropion, but since it has the bad rap of exacerbating tics, someone needs to read the full journal article and figure that out (have a look at [[Treatment of Tourette syndrome]] on the stimulant issue -- I haven't followed bupropion that closely, I only know it has that rap so people won't touch it).

:Fine, accepted, but the same applies to the others making statements there  questioning the motives of others and making outrageous statements about a &quot;cadre&quot; protecting the article.  Happyme22 has pretty much developed that article on his own, and the POV pushing has come out of the woodwork only since he's gotten the article up to standard.

::According to your own statements, you're not familiar with the editing of the Reagan article, so you're not in a position to characterize it at all, are you? I worked on the Reagan article also, and I know that Happy was quite partisan in his editing, and was cited for it by more than a few editors (sorry, not all of those editors were &quot;left wingers&quot; or whatever the current term of art is for those who disagree with you). Dozens of times we would have to point out to Happy that he was being partisan in his editing (early on, he didn't know what that meant; he said something like &quot;I am not a Reagan partisan, not at all...though I am a conservative Republican and a Reagan follower and I like him very much and I think he was a great president&quot;). To his credit, each time it was pointed out that his edits were heavily POV, he would go along with the factual correction. His POV was all over the article, from small things (like removing all references - ALL - to Reagan's first wife, and claiming that he and Nancy had been together since the 1930's; he called Reagan's state funeral a &quot;''major'' state funeral&quot;) to big things, like conflating policy with accomplishment (his said one of Reagan's early ''policies'' was to reduce inflation), mischaracterizing the state of the economy, both pre- and post-Reagan, claiming that &quot;a few&quot; scandals&quot; were &quot;experienced&quot; but &quot;only in his second term&quot;, and claiming that Reagan &quot;narrowly lost a bid&quot; for the Presidency in 1976.

::The point of all this info is to counter - factually and logically - your claim that no one could have been protecting article, or it wouldn't have taken him (''him''? - it's not &quot;his&quot; article) six FACs; it is precisely ''because'' there was legacy-burnishing going on that it has taken this long. The article has not been stable nor neutral since Happy decided to &quot;own&quot; it, and that alone can be the cause for not being accepted for FA. Moreover, no &quot;POV-pushers&quot; have &quot;come out of the woodwork&quot; - except, of course, you. It's getting tiring to remind people who have an agenda that the only part of their agenda they can get into wiki is the part that conforms with the facts; of course, the further from reality the agenda gets, the harder it is for them to accept that.

Hey :) What do you think of the following text, courtesy of some outlandish data?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It has been stipulated that bupropion, and stimulants in general, may aggravate [[tic]]s. A [[case series]] published in 1993 suggested that bupropion treatment exacerbates tics in chlidren with [[comorbidity|coexistent]] [''coexisting?'' both sound terrible, I can't think of anything more appropriate] [[ADHD]] and [[Tourette syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spencer T, Biederman J, Steingard R, Wilens T |title=Bupropion exacerbates tics in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and Tourette's syndrome |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=211–4 |year=1993 |pmid=8428875 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no data from placebo-controlled trials to support this, and more recent studies indicate that stimulants may be safely and effectively used even in the presence of [[tic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poncin Y, Sukhodolsky DG, McGuire J, Scahill L |title=Drug and non-drug treatments of children with ADHD and tic disorders|journal= Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry|volume=16 Suppl 9|pages=78–88|year=2007|doi=10.1007/s00787-007-1010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here's a recent reference you might want to take a look at. It's free and it's authoritative (for Scotland) and (wow) it gives explicit confidence ratings for its recommendations. At least one downside: it's not published in a refereed journal. I found out about it via a recently published editorial (PMID 17725771) by one of its coauthors along with someone else. I haven't had time to digest it but it may well affect [[Autism]]. You may want to search for the string &quot;Asperger&quot; in it.

Hi,

Could you have a look at the following?  Autism and [[applied behavioral analysis]] are closely intertwined.  I'm fighting (for the third time) for the wording in [[Talk:Applied behavior analysis#Citations in violation of WP: UNDUE and WP:V]] regarding the use of wording on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Applied_behavior_analysis&amp;diff=154502020&amp;oldid=154367151 article] and am pretty tired of it.  Would you mind putting in a comment?  There's a chance I'm mis-interpreting [[WP:RS]] but I don't think so.  However, I'm not going to be on-line for the next day to several weeks and I don't seem to be making a dent.  I'm going to be posting this on Eubulides as well as you both seem to be working on the autism stuff a fair bit these days.  [[User:WLU|WLU]] 01:11, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

== Rape of Nanking FAC ==

Looking at the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/The Rape of Nanking (book)|Rape of Nanking FAC]], it seems like most or all of the issues that have been raised are the content of the article rather than the style of writing or MoS problems.  I expected this, since the topic has been the subject of controversy.  But I wonder if you could give it a read and point out any MoS and style problems that need to be fixed.  Also, I'd like to ask what your opinion is of the article ever getting to FA status.  MoS and style problems are easy to fix - there are guidelines written to tell us what is the best way to edit the article.  But the issues that are raised may be fundamental differences between editors on how the article should read.  It's likely that it'll never satisfy all FA reviewers, and it would be disappointing if it never gets promoted because the 2 or 3 reviewers simply think the article should be written differently instead of having a problem with the writing style or MoS adherence.

That seems like a good way to have the request overlooked.  It's not visible to editors reading the page normally.

While I have your attention, some of the things you said on Raul's page aren't true.  I didn't go complaining to his page (you did), nor did I complain there about the long pages.  I did complain there about my declaration being completely misrepresented in a tally box on another article (Apprentice); this is the problem I have with tally boxes.  I didn't even lodge an Oppose there, yet I was misrepresented in the tally box.  I also did not oppose any FAC based on size of the FAC; I merely mentioned the size of the FAC.

Anyway, I am sorry that you had to undertake the painful process of linking all the years. Bye the way, how are you? I have become somewhat less active in Wikipedia these days.

== FAR archives + Nude celebrities ==

(How's that for a headline?)

Hi Sandy. Do you mind leaving the FAR archive for me to update? I have no good reason beyond a sentimental attachment to adding the total to the page. Being me, I'll be a day or two late sometimes but there's no harm. (Plus you don't need more wikignome demands.)

Also I just noticed [[Nude celebrities on the Internet]] sitting on FFA and removed it. It was there as far back as the beginning of the year but I haven't checked further. Have we been sitting on vandalism for months or am I missing something? [[User:Marskell|Marskell]] 08:05, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

:Nevermind. It was an FA for two months in '04. [[User:Marskell|Marskell]] 08:46, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

::Thinking about it, I had read the words previously when updating the page. It was only [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nude celebrities on the Internet|just deleted yesterday]] and it was the redlink that threw me. A first: FA, FFA, deleted. (It was never a particularly good article, judging the deleted edits.) [[User:Marskell|Marskell]] 12:02, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

==Renewable energy in Scotland==
Thanks for your note re 'Incomplete citations'. I will attend to this and let you know when I think its up to scratch. [[User:Ben MacDui|Ben MacDui]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Ben MacDui|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:43, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

I am wading through the [[Renewable energy in Scotland]] references. As this is my first succesful FA venture I wonder if I could ask you to take a quick look at refs 106-118? As far as I can see they are now acceptable, but it would annoying if I have missed something crucial (e.g. linking the retrieval date, which I don't believe is a necessity). [[User:Ben MacDui|Ben MacDui]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Ben MacDui|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:38, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

I have gone through the references a few times, and whilst I think it is probably close enough it would be a miracle if I had not missed something. I am aware of a couple of broken links, but please let me know what else may be required. Due to an unavaoidable clash of dates I am afraid will almost certainly be unable to access an internet-connected keyboard from about lunchtime on the 6th to early afternoon on the 8th. I know that the watchers will be looking afer things on the 8th itself, but if you can think of anything else I might need to do before then, please let me know asap. 

With no urgency whatever if you could direct me to the answers to a couple of queries I have about this process I'd be grateful. My browsers show up a jaunty little Acrobat image indicating if a link is a pdf. Presumably the reason for adding (PDF) is that not everyone will see this? I have looked a couple of times, but even after a year of wandering about the highways and byways of this esteemed organ I cannot figure out what the purpose of linking dates is (or why someone has not produced a bot to do it). 

Many thanks for your patience and help, and apologies for my wiki-fumblings. [[User:Ben MacDui|Ben MacDui]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Ben MacDui|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:43, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

== Deletion of [[Nude celebrities on the Internet]] ==

If you removed the link, that's OK. As someone else pointed out this is a first for Wikipedia - a page which has gone through the stage of being featured, and has finally been deleted.

==MOS for measurements==
I looked over some of the MOS pages regarding some things and don't see anywhere in which it is either recommended or not recommended that measurements, such as [[acre]], [[hectare]], [[gallons]], etc. should or shouldn't be wikilinked in FA level articles when they first appear in said articles....do you know where i can find info on this issue?--[[User:MONGO|MONGO]] 17:18, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

OK, sorry, Mongo, I wasn't fully focused earlier.  First, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you need to take a look at the first section of [[WP:MOSNUM]] regarding non-breaking hard spaces.  Numerical and non-numerical elements need to be joined.  The problem throughout your article is that the 7 can get separated from the World Trade Center by line wrap, or the 5:20 by the pm, or the 1 from the WTC, and it looks really goofy when that happens.  You've got to go through and put nbsps on all of those.  On the linking of units question, now I see what you are asking.  It's probably not mentioned in MOSNUM because that would be redundant with [[WP:MOSLINK]] and [[WP:CONTEXT]].  Generally, common terms known to most English-speaking need not be linked.  So, you wouldn't link &quot;inch&quot; or &quot;foot&quot;, but maybe you would link a lesser-known unit of measurement, something that not all readers are familiar with.  I hope that answers the question?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 20:05, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

Is it me, or are the reviewers on the FAC treating it rather like an AfD?

And they keep claiming there are prose concerns and not elaborating what they are so I can fix them. Do you think we should put a notice at the top noting what FAC is about?

== Runcorn failed FA ==

Sandy.  Despite your best efforts, and some of mine, [[Runcorn]] has failed again as a FA.  I am grateful to you for your &quot;tutorial&quot; on how to cite references properly; most helpful, both for now and for the future.  You may have realised that I am a Wikinovice and I am not an academic.  So the whole Wikiexperience has been for me complex, stimulating, frustrating and often difficult to comprehend.  I have learnt a lot.  I shall not be going for FA again &amp;ndash; but I do feel that the article far surpasses many others on GB settlements.  At least I have the assurance that those who consult the article will have some reliable information about the place.  And that's what an encyclopaedia is supposed to be about, isn't it?  

As an aside, on the very day I was completing the details for the Runcorn references, the FA on the main page, [[John Millington Synge]], had just one inline citation.  I must say that the aspect I dislike most about Wikipedia is its inconsistency.  Best wishes, Peter. [[User:Peter I. Vardy|Peter I. Vardy]] 09:10, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

You probably know that pyroluria has nothing to do with porphyria. Pyroluria in it self is a very controvercial diagnosis.

I'm afraid it's slightly more complex than that.

** Please see the note at the top of my talk page; I'll answer as I can but I've ''got'' to go half an hour ago.  Tony1 works to build consensus and doesn't edit MOS without consensus.  And he compromises when needed.  MOS *requires* stability because people consult it daily; instability there affects places like FAC and FAR in addition to other editors doing their daily work and trying to conform to MOS.  Pmanderson edits unilaterally, and almost invariably introduces indecipherable prose; I usually can't understand what his edits to MOS mean, which certainly makes my work at FAC and FAR harder.  It looks like he's taken to simply opposing anything Tony1 writes, even if he has no basis, even when Tony's edits are based on consensus.  I can certainly understand Tony1 reaching the end of his rope (if he has, not sure) considering the damage I've watched pmanderson due to the MOS over the last months, and the personal level to which he has taken to opposing Tony1's edits simply, apparently, for the sake of it. I'm just surprised that you would take a personal dispute to the Community sanction board, but I've long considered that something needs to be done to ban Pmanderson from editing MOS because his edits have such a bad effect there.  Of course, that's separate from the gender-neutral issue, but I suspect PM is just out to get Tony1 now, no matter what Tony writes, and it's understandable if Tony1 was fed up with it by the time you came on the scene.

***My issue with Tony is really unrelated to this MOS/Pmanderson issue.

I've pulled the following out of your recent archive:

:Here's a recent reference you might want to take a look at. It's free and it's authoritative (for Scotland) and (wow) it gives explicit confidence ratings for its recommendations. At least one downside: it's not published in a refereed journal. I found out about it via a recently published editorial (PMID 17725771) by one of its coauthors along with someone else. I haven't had time to digest it but it may well affect [[Autism]]. You may want to search for the string &quot;Asperger&quot; in it. (Yes, I know, it's not like you're lacking work to do for [[Asperger's]].) Anyway, here's the reference: {{cite paper |author= Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) |date=2007 |title= Assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for children and young people with autism spectrum disorders |version= SIGN publication no. 98 |url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign98.pdf |accessdate=2007-09-01 |format=PDF}} [[User:Eubulides|Eubulides]] 05:45, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

I'd just like to clarify that although it isn't &quot;published in a refereed journal&quot;, there is an extensive review process, which includes both specialist referees and various interested groups. &quot;Each guideline is based on a systematic review and critical appraisal of the current scientific literature.&quot; Have a look at their [http://www.sign.ac.uk/about/introduction.html web site]. IMO, their guidelines are are at the very top of the quality spectrum wrt to [[WP:MEDRS]]. [[User:Colin|Colin]]°[[User talk:Colin|&lt;sup&gt;Talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:13, 5 September 2007 (UTC)
:I did look at it; it's excellent, and the methodology they use of highlighting the strength of each conclusion is awesome.  But I didn't find anything there that wasn't already represented in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;oldid=155589870 last accurate version] of [[Asperger syndrome]] (it's already been taken apart again, includes factual inaccuracies, misrepresentation of sources, and weasly and choppy prose), so while I share Eubulides' enthusiasm for the source and their writing method, I didn't see where I could make use of the article. Considering the issues on AS, whether or not we have another or more reliable sources really isn't the problem.  Only one of the regular editors of AS appears to even read the research and attempt to make edits based on reliable sources, the others openly reject consensus reporting of majority viewpoints, espouse undue weight, encourage unsourced and inaccurate edits, view the article as an advocacy vehicle rather than a source of accurate and comprehensive information, and let unsourced inaccuracies stand unchallenged in the article.  Providing dozens of high quality reliable sources there will not solve the problem anyway, which is apathy from other experienced editors who do know policy in the face of an intense POV-driven agenda from those who own the article. I've removed myself from the Medicine projects and removed medicine and autism-related articles from my watchlist and consider that the aim of improving these articles on Wiki to a reliable standard to be a lost cause; there's no support from the Project and other editors for maintaining Wiki policies even on a featured article supposed to represent Wiki's best work, so there's little hope for other articles.  I guess Wiki really mostly is a place for two types of editors and articles; those with a POV-driven agenda, and children who vandalize and write pop culture articles.  There is little concern that most Wiki medical articles—a topic of some significance to real people's real lives adn where accuracy matters—are hitting number one on Google yet are blatantly, embarassingly and dangerously inaccurate and unreliable.  If that's what Medicine editors allow to happen to a featured article, what hope is there for the rest?  Shall I keep swimming against the massive tide of unreliable inaccurate medical information on Wikipedia's featured medical articles mostly alone? No, that would be just stupid and Pollyanna, wouldn't it.  Read the message at the top of my talk page about [[pyroluria]]; that's what Wiki is good for (a fountain where medical quackery can water all day long), and I don't think anyone in the Medicine project, besides you, notices or cares much about maintaining even a featured article to Wiki policies of verifiability to reliable sources.

== [[Jayne Mansfield]] ==

You have in the past done a quick review of the article, and I'm requesting you to take another look. I have read your troubles with internet connectivity at the moment. But, can you, please, do the article a big favor? I'd very much like to have {{tl|fact}} tags slapped on to the critical information that really desperately needs a citation. And, may be then you can post a message to that end to [[Wikipedia:Peer review/Jayne Mansfield/archive1]]. That way it will be easier for me to get attention the really knowledgeable people who have worked on the article before. They may be weak in writing encyclopedic articles, but they know their Ms Mansfield. The article has come a long way, and I really want it to become a GA now. Cheers. &lt;font face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot; color=&quot;deeppink&quot;&gt;[[User:Aditya Kabir|Aditya]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Aditya Kabir|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aditya Kabir|contribs]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:23, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

Hmmm... I see you everywhere on here - you'd make a good admin... :) [[User:Spawn Man|Spawn Man]] 03:35, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

==Ready for your review==
Hello, thank you again for taking a look at [[2005 Texas Longhorn football team]], which is a Featured Article candidate.  Over the last few days, I have worked on several aspects of the article including:
*wikilinking - I took some redundant ones out and added some sports terms that were not linked before.  I did leave a few duplicates in where it seems like the links are far apart in the article.  This is a judgment call so I am not opposed to tweaking them further if there are any objections.
*consistent formatting of footnotes
*consistent formatting of dates throughout the article
*correct application of [[WP:HYPHEN]] 
*correct application of [[WP:DASH]] 
The FAC is at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/2005 Texas Longhorn football team]].  I would appreciate it if you would take a second look and offer your thoughts.  Thanks very much, [[User:Johntex|'''Johntex''']]\&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Johntex|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:48, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

**Take it easy. No-one is trying to &quot;bar&quot; anyone from anyone's Talk page.
