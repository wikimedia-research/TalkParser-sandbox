== &quot;zhid&quot; as &quot;kike&quot; = nonsense. ==

I have removed the line which claims that in the ukrainian language the word &quot;zhid&quot; is a pejorative that translates as &quot;kike.&quot;  this is utter nonsense.  Zhid is simpply &quot;Jew,&quot; which, as in English. Can take on negative connotations in certain settings just as it can in English (and just as other words can too) but is by no means primarily or even largely a pejorative (unlike the n-word, which might under some uses have non pejorative connotations but is primarily a pejorative).  It is occasionally stated by ignorants that the word &quot;evrei&quot; is the &quot;polite&quot; alternative.  Rubbish!  &quot;evrei&quot; means &quot;Hebrew&quot;, which is as stilted t use in Ukrainian as it would be to call a group of jewish people in the USA a bunch of &quot;hebrews.&quot;  and, of course, there is the issue that Jews in the location of the movie were at most Yiddish, not Hebrew speakers.   Then idea that &quot;zhid&quot; means &quot;kike&quot; has for decades been a deliberate bit of misinformation meant to discredit and deligitimize Ukrainian nationalism.  It has no place in Wikipedia.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.124.51.61|91.124.51.61]] ([[User talk:91.124.51.61|talk]]) 10:37, 24 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Suicide ==
The article states that the Grandfather does not kill himself, but I'm pretty sure it's implied that he does in the book, though it is not explicitly stated. I don't have my copy of the novel right now, but if someone could look it up that'd be great, I believe it's in the final letter section of the book, just before the final historical story but I could be wrong.

The article actually states &quot;In the movie, Alex's grandfather commits suicide by slitting his wrists in a bathtub during their trip, while in the book, he does not do so.&quot;

In the book, Alex's grandfather ''doesn't'' kill himself during their trip. He does it later, after Jonathan has returned to the US. So, technically the claim is true, although, it could do with a re-write to avoid ambiguity.

I have now re-written this part, to make it clearer. ~ Loop

== Language ==

:'' Although the film is set in the Ukraine, all non-English dialogue is in Russian rather than Ukrainian''

Not exactly true—when the main characters are driving in the countryside they stop a couple of times to ask for directions in Russian, and the locals respond in Ukrainian.  These moments are lost for anglophones reading the subtitles, but precious for one who can make out the language.  ''—[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;2006-01-21&amp;nbsp;09:39&amp;nbsp;Z&lt;/small&gt;''

Indeed. I noticed that and changed it. Also, the peasant woman at the end speaks Russian with a Ukranian accent, so one can assume that her primary language is Ukranian and there is no inconsistency. -Alex

== Bzenc ==

I am a collector. In 1980 I attempted to visit the shtetl Bzenc.&lt;br&gt;

== Car? ==

Can anyone find a source for ID of the car? [http://carscenes.blogspot.com/2007/12/everything-is-illuminated-can-someone.html All I can find] are people asking the same question. [[User:Tedder|Tedder]] ([[User talk:Tedder|talk]]) 07:06, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

== How it ends ==
Is it relevant to say that &quot;How it ends&quot; by DeVotchka (used in the trailer) is the title track of [[Little Miss Sunshine]], which Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf also produced?

== Train Station ==

The train station in the film says Lviv, but that's not Lviv's train station.  It's definitely not Odesa's train station.  Does anyone know where that was shot?[[Special:Contributions/88.88.110.191|88.88.110.191]] ([[User talk:88.88.110.191|talk]]) 19:05, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

:For [http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3396114688/tt0404030 this exterior shot], [[:cs:Průmyslový palác|Prague Industrial Palace]] built in 1891 is being used. [http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3647772928/tt0404030 The shot by train] probably shows [[Praha Masarykovo nádraží|Masaryk Railway Station]]. --[[User:Jvs.cz|Jvs.cz]] ([[User talk:Jvs.cz|talk]]) 15:55, 9 November 2009 (UTC)

== Zhyd ==
I assure you, that this word is very offensive everywhere in ex-USSR. It's like calling Afro-american - &quot;nigger&quot;. But sometimes it can be used in an ironic manner.

: I agree. &quot;Jewish&quot; in Russian is &quot;Evrej&quot;. By the way in the dinner scene at the Ukrainian hotel the grandfather's knowledge of yiddish is revealed when he translates for his nephew the word ''shtetl'' (village). He can grasp the word pronounced by the American guest because of their common linguistic family background so I think that yiddish also should be listed among the languages of this movie.

: In ukrainian 'жид' coresponds to 'jew' and 'єврей' to 'hebrew', 'жид' can be seen as more blunt in some contexts but is by no means outright derogatory in the ukrainian language [[Special:Contributions/216.154.80.194|216.154.80.194]] ([[User talk:216.154.80.194|talk]]) 18:27, 17 February 2014 (UTC)

== Plot ==

The plot reads like a promo... The plot section should contain a summary of the overall plot, including how it ends (WP does not hold back from including &quot;spoilers&quot; — nor warns about their presence — this is an encyclopædia, not a trailer/promo site for books/movies). — [[User:Imeriki al-Shimoni|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#60d;font-weight:bold;text-shadow:3px 3px 2px #aaa;&quot;&gt;al-Shimoni&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Imeriki al-Shimoni|talk]]) 21:26, 20 June 2012 (UTC)
