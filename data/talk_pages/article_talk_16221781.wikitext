== More information about the importance of Snedden ==

I am from German WIKI so I can only draw your attention to the following links: [http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2426/Snedden-David-1868-1951.html Snedden-David-1868-1951] and some of his books [http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=David%20S.%20Snedden Books by Snedden in internet archive] - read online. Recommendation for a deeper look [http://www.stanford.edu/~dlabaree/publications/How_Dewey_Lost.pdf How Dewey lost]. Good luck and best wishes to you who may work on this. --[[Special:Contributions/178.11.235.191|178.11.235.191]] ([[User talk:178.11.235.191|talk]]) 08:28, 4 February 2012 (UTC)
