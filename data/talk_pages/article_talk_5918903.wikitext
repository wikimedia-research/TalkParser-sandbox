==UA232, and the subjunctive==
I'll have a look at the discrepancy you mention in the article on the plane crash.

Were I a more scholarly user of the language, I am sure I would agree with you on the subjunctive... (although I do enjoy using it in German, strangely enough). I suppose I think that it tends to lend a somewhat archaic feeling to the articles. Clarity demands simple sentences in a project like this which is used by many for whom (and that's a word whose misuse and overuse triggers similar feelings in me, by the way) English is not a mother tongue. Would that it were otherwise. Best wishes, --[[User:Guinnog|Guinnog]] 21:27, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

:I have had a look at the UA 232 article and cannot see the discrepancies that you mention. Can you elucidate? --[[User:Guinnog|Guinnog]] 22:35, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

::I have just read your comment in the aricle talk page, which perhaps I should have done before my last message. The speed of sound varies with altitude (or more correctly with air pressure, so temperature and humidity matter too, though less so. See [[Mach number]] for more details. --[[User:Guinnog|Guinnog]] 22:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

::: First of all, please read the article [[Hey, I majored in Philosophy! (excuse for anything)]]. I  be of the opinion, etc.&lt;br&gt; OK. [[Mach number]] varies with all those thingies, but '[[mach|[a]t a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, Mach 1 is 340.3 m·s-1 (1,225 km·h-1 or 761.2 mph)]]'.  The aeroplane was travelling at '270 knots', and '[[knots|1 knot = 1.000 nautical mile/hour = 1.852 km/h exactly]]'. This means it was travelling at 270 x 1.852 km/h, = 500.04 km/h.  Are my calculations wrong here?  If the aeroplane was flying through [[Dulce de leche]] rather than the atmosphere at 37,000 feet, the [[Mach number]] might be substantially different.  &lt;br&gt;  Ooops, gotta go.  [[Billy  Crystal]] is on [[Enough Rope|Denton]].  Continue this later. --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] 11:50, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

==borebkole==

Hi Shirt
Nope, Never heard of this before. As you say I merely moved it into the article proper. borebkole is a DOG!! You reckon the Dutch eat DOG on Halloween (that's when we eat Colcannon). Maybe this is a hoax?! ([[User:Sarah777|Sarah777]] 16:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC))

I guess I guessed you didn't mean the Dutch eat Dog! Those Speculaas look yummy.
I reckon if you suss out the borebkole recipe I'll have to make some and taste it!

== Re:Jon/Joan/Jaun Elia ==

I think the transliteration used in the title should be used through out the article. Usage of multiple transliterations is a result of multiple ediors using their personal preferences. [[User:Szhaider|Szhaider]] 20:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Well, I thank you, kind sir!  Thanks also for making me aware of this doggy tale, one that obviously got away.  I was in South America with some friends over Christmas, only returning home for the New Year with a zillion things to catch up on: and not so long after I got back I had to trot off to Bulgaria.  It gets worse, because I will be spending most of February in Mexico City-sigh!!!  In future if there is anything I can help you with just flag it up and I will do my best.  Love.

== Murali leg spin ==

Hello there,

1995-96 is a bit too early for me - I was only 11 at the time - but a quick Google [http://www.muralitharan.org/murali/bernard3.htm reveals] that Murali was certainly doing Shane Warne impressions as far back as 1999, and last time I checked there was a YouTube link on Murali's Wiki article showing him doing the same thing this year.  Also - SuggestBot (what a nice idea, I'd never heard of it) thinks you should do Northants Cricket Club eh?  Any idea what gave it that notion? Cheers, [[User:Lfh|Lfh]] 11:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

==Loomis==
Well, Hellooo again Shirty.  You continue to embarrass me with your effusions of admiration.  But I'm a big boy now, I can take it.  

About Lewis, we do indeed have a good relationship, and I'd like to think it will withstand my latest and most strongly worded broadside.  He's already apologised for the inappropriate behaviour that lead to it, and now seems to be taking a Wiki-breather to have a think about things.  He appointed me his Wiki-mentor some time back, and I take that role seriously, so I trust he still considers me as such.  Sometime strong words are called for, to make a person sit up and open their eyes and stop acting in a knee-jerk (or any kind of jerk) manner.  &quot;That's what friends are for&quot;.  I'd really love to sit down with him over a bottle of red and explain in detail why some things work and others don't.  Emails etc are fine, up to a point, but some things really need body language, personal rapport, and an uninterrupted dialogue.  I'm sure you know what I mean.  I'm even half-tempted to send him my phone number so we can chat about life and whatever.  But I'll think a bit more before doing that.  Have a great day, man.

== Helen Garner ==

Hi Shirt58. I notice that you put the info re the Archibald Prize in the lead section of the Garner article. I'm not sure that the Archibald prize info is appropriate for the lead section. Here is the Wikipedia style guidelines on Lead Sections [[WP:LS]]. As I understand it, the Lead Section should provide an overview and summary of what comes later - it generally should not, I think, have information that is not followed up later in the article.  Also, as Garner's main claim to fame is her writing and as there is nothing specifically noteworthy/controversial about the Archibald painting of her (finalist, not winner etc), I think that this is interesting information well worth including but not the sort of critical information needed in the lead section? Anyhow, that's just my two-pennysworth. I am still learning here - still trying to understand, myself, what makes a good article, so am very open to discussing this with you. Cheers [[User:Sterry2607|Sterry2607]] ([[User talk:Sterry2607|talk]]) 01:32, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
:PS I agree that the info re criteria for the Prize need not be there. I didn't even properly notice that it was there when I was editing the article yesterday! [[User:Sterry2607|Sterry2607]] ([[User talk:Sterry2607|talk]]) 01:35, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks for your generous response. It is so nice when these things can be discussed reasonably. I left the Archibald Prize info where it was until I heard from you. I think in the interim I'd put it under Life, but if the article got expanded it could perhaps go under some other section to do with her wider impact/recognition but we need more before we could do that. I have a love-hate relationship with her, but I do think she is a wonderful/powerful writer! And she admires one of my big favourites, Elizabeth Jolley. Then again, she is critical of another favourite of mine, Thea Astley! I have 'Cosmo cosmolino' next to my bed. I must read it one day.

Hi Shirt 58. Indeed, he appears to be notable, but I placed the tags there because there were no references to say he was notable.

I thought you might find it useful to have some information about  references (refs) on wikipedia. These are important to [[WP:V|validate]] your writing and inform the reader. Any editor can removed unreferenced material; and unsubstantiated articles may end up getting deleted, so when you add something to an article, it's highly advisable to also [[Wikipedia:When to cite|include a reference]] to say where it came from. Referencing may look daunting, but it's easy enough to do. Here's a guide to getting started. 

;&lt;big&gt;Good references&lt;/big&gt;

A reference must be accurate, i.e. it must prove the statement in the text. To validate &quot;Mike Brown climbed Everest&quot;, it's no good linking to a page about Everest, if Mike Brown isn't mentioned, nor to one on Mike Brown, if it doesn't say that he climbed Everest. You have to link to a source that proves his achievement is true. You must use [[WP:Reliable sources|reliable sources]], such as published books, mainstream press, and authorised web sites. Blogs, Myspace, Youtube, fan sites and extreme minority texts are not usually acceptable, nor is [[WP:Original research|original research]] (e.g. your own unpublished, or self-published, essay or research), or another wikipedia article.

;&lt;big&gt;Inserting a reference&lt;/big&gt;

The first thing you have to do is to create a &quot;Notes and references&quot; section (unless it already exists). This goes towards the bottom of the page, below the &quot;See also&quot; section and above the &quot;External links&quot; section. Enter this code:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;==Notes and references==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The next step is to put a reference in the text. Here is the code to do that. It goes at the end of the relevant term, phrase, sentence, or paragraph to which the note refers, and ''after'' punctuation such as a full stop, without a space (to prevent separation through line wrap): 

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Whatever text you put in between these two tags will become visible  in the &quot;Notes and references&quot; section as your reference.

;&lt;big&gt;Test it out&lt;/big&gt;

Open the edit box for this page, copy the following text (inserting your own text where indicated), paste it at the bottom of the page  and save the page:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;==Reference test==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Reference details go here''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:&lt;nowiki&gt;==Notes and references==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

(End of text to copy and paste.)

It should appear like this:

:;Reference test

:This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.&lt;ref&gt;''Reference details go here''&lt;/ref&gt;

:;Notes and references

:{{reflist}}

;&lt;big&gt;Information to include&lt;/big&gt;

You need to include the information to enable the reader to find your source. For an online newspaper source, it might look like this:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, John.  [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  [[2005-10-27]]. Retrieved on [[2005-10-27]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

When uploaded, it appears as:
:Plunkett, John. [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  [[2005-10-27]]. Retrieved on [[2005-10-27]].

Note the single square brackets around the URL and the article title. The format is:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://URL &quot;Title of article&quot;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
Make sure there is a space between the URL and the Title. This code results in the URL being hidden and the title showing as a link.  Use double apostrophes for the article title (it is quoted text), and two single quote marks either side of the name of the paper (to generate italics). Double square brackets round the name of the paper create an internal link (a wikilink) to the relevant wikipedia article. Apostrophes must go outside the brackets.

The date after ''The Guardian'' is the date of the newspaper, and the date after &quot;Retrieved on&quot; is the date you accessed the site &amp;ndash; useful for searching the [http://www.archive.org web archive] in case the link goes dead.  Dates are wikilinked so that they work with user [[Help:Preferences|preference settings]] to display the date in the format the user wishes.

;&lt;big&gt;References not online&lt;/big&gt;

You can use sources which are not online, but which you have found in a library or elsewhere&amp;mdash;in which case leave out the information which is not relevant. The newspaper example above would be formatted like this:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, John. &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[2005-10-27]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

When uploaded, it appears as:
:Plunkett, John. &quot;Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[2005-10-27]].

Here is an example for a book:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charmley, John (2006). ''The Princess and the Politicians'', p.60. Penguin Books Ltd., London. ISBN 0140289712.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

When uploaded, it appears as:
::Charmley, John (2006). ''The Princess and the Politicians''. Penguin Books Ltd., London. ISBN 0140289712.

Make sure you put two single quote marks round the title (to generate italics), rather than one double quote mark.

;&lt;big&gt;Date format&lt;/big&gt;

These formats are all acceptable for dates:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[2005-10-27]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[27 January]] [[2007]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[January 27]], [[2007]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;&lt;big&gt;Citation templates&lt;/big&gt;

You may prefer to use a citation template to compile details of the source. The template goes between the ref tags and you fill out the fields you wish to. Basic templates can be found here: [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles/Citation quick reference]] 

;&lt;big&gt;Same ref used twice or more&lt;/big&gt;

The first time a reference appears in the article, you can give it a simple name in the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; code:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Details of ref here&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The second time you use the same reference in the article, you need only to create a short cut instead of typing it all out again:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You can then use the short cut as many times as you want. Don't forget the /, or it will blank the rest of the article! A short cut will only pick up from higher up the page, so make sure the first ref is the full one. Some symbols don't work in the ref name, but you'll find out if you use them.

You can see multiple use of the same refs in action in the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Bowyer_%28artist%29&amp;oldid=179436485 William Bowyer (artist).] There are 3 sources and they are each referenced 3 times. Each statement in the article has a footnote to show what its source is.

;&lt;big&gt;Alternative system&lt;/big&gt;
The above method is simple and combines references and notes into one section.  A refinement is to put the full details of the references in their own section headed &quot;References&quot;, while the notes which apply to them appear in a separate section headed &quot;Notes&quot;. The notes can be inserted in the main article text in an abbreviated form as seen in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harriet_Arbuthnot&amp;oldid=165667213 Harriet Arbuthnot] or in a full form as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brown_Dog_affair&amp;oldid=179000868 Brown Dog affair.]

==Speedy deletion of [[:Cassiopedia]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Cassiopedia]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] as well as the [[Wikipedia:Business' FAQ]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Cassiopedia|the page]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:Cassiopedia|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. {{#ifeq: {{{willprovide}}}|No||Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that a copy be emailed to you.}} &amp;mdash; [[User:HelloAnnyong|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #666&quot;&gt;Annyong&lt;/span&gt;''']] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:HelloAnnyong|(say whaaat?!)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:03, 23 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt;

== MSA and Houli ==

Hello! The reason I asked why you'd want the MSA rendering of the name was to point out that the name should be transcribed or transliterated in [[Lebanese Arabic]] rather than MSA. For example, the name Jamal is pronounced [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]] in [[Masri|Egyptian]], so it has to be transliterated the same way. Thanks for the kind Easter wishes, though I prefer the secular and more ancient holiday [[Sham El Nessim]], which Egyptians of all religions (or lack thereof) celebrated recently as well :-) Cheers, — [[User:Zerida|Zerida]] [[User talk:Zerida|&lt;font color=&quot;RoyalBlue&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Unicode&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:09, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

Uploaded [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FreeImagefromCSIROEnto_AustralianInsectCommonNames_Abacarus-hystrix.jpg this] public domain image to en.wikipedia, then realised my error and uploaded it to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FreeImagefromCSIROEnto_AustralianInsectCommonNames_Abacarus-hystrix.jpg the commons]. The en.wikipedia image should be deleted.  Can't simply &quot;blank the page&quot; - this appears not to work, and even it did would seem to me somewhat inelegant.

== Re: Bill Harrigan ==

Hi Daniel, &lt;br /&gt;
I noticed you started [[User:Daniel/Sandbox/Bill Harrigan|sandboxing]] an article about [[Bill Harrigan]] about a fortnight after [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Harrigan&amp;oldid=230810834 I] re-started the [[Talk:Bill_Harrigan|three-times deleted]] article. Three questions:&lt;br /&gt;
* Why [[Bill Harrigan]]?
* Why the wait?
* Your sandboxed article looks better to me than the current article.  I must admit I am sorely tempted to copy+paste your work into the existing article and [[Wikipedia:Editcountitis|so add it on my edit count]]. Hmm. This doesn't seem to be a question at all. Or is it?&lt;br /&gt;--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58|talk]]) 12:42, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
:Heh :)
:*Cos I &lt;3 Harrigan. All-time favourite NRL personality, above and beyond any player. Met him once, got his book also.
:*Cos I'm lazy and easily distracted :) See the history of [[1999 Sydney hailstorm]] (which I did eventually finish and move to mainspace) for another fine exhibit of my laziness.
:*Normally I like finishing my articles before moving them across, but quite frankly, go for it :) Provided you say something like &quot;Written by &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Daniel]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, copying to this article&quot; or something, I don't mind!

== Help needed for ref for move ==

You can call me Bugboy52.4, or just Bugboy will be fine too. Well I don't believe there are any consensuses for naming an article (That is insects anyway, see Category:Wikipedia naming conventions, and [[Wikipedia:List_of_guidelines]] or [[Wikipedia:List_of_policies]]), and when I name an article I always use their binomial name, see ''[[Syntomeida epilais | Syntomeida Epilais]]'' or ''[[Urophora cardui | Urophora cardui]]''. But I always make a redirect page, see [[Polka-Dot Wasp Moth | Polka-dot wasp moth]], so when someone goes searching for the species, they can still find it(considering that they most likely won't know the binomial name).

== Wiki-table help needed - [[Nerds FC]] ==

{{tnull|helpme}}
Hi all, &lt;br /&gt;
I've tidied the &quot;[[Nerds_FC#Squad_2|second series squad]]&quot; as best I can, but there is still info lower in the table in wiki-code - from player name Felix Lawrence to to Frank Awaritefe's &quot;nerd interest&quot; - which isn't presenting when the page is viewed.&lt;br /&gt;
As always, your help and guidance sincerely appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 10:48, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nerds_FC&amp;diff=273166613&amp;oldid=273161725 Fixed]. That was really the same kind of problem you fixed with your edits right before. --[[User talk:Amalthea|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;font-variant:small-caps;color:#823824;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Amalthea&lt;/span&gt;]] 10:59, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

== A fringe of leaves ==

I see that you've started an article. Are you a Patrick White aficionado? It is one of my favourite novels. [[User:Tony1|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;'''Tony'''&lt;/font &gt;]] [[User talk:Tony1|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font &gt;]] 16:17, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot; help needed ==

{{tnull|helpme}}
Hi all, &lt;br /&gt;
'''Problem''': The article [[What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?]] currently looks jumbled and not particularly [[Wikipedia:Readability|readable]]. I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What_Becomes_of_the_Broken_Hearted%3F&amp;oldid=278915320 smallerised] the book cover image, but no dice, article still lumpy, with &lt;nowiki&gt; [edit] &lt;/nowiki&gt; handles in non-intuitive places. The article itself currently contains info about two non-controversially [[WP:NOTABLE|notable]] things, the book and the movie, but is mostly about the movie.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Solution''': Start an article [[What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? (novel)]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Problem with the Solution''': The 1996 novel preceded the 1999 movie.  The movie was contingent on the novel.  Arguably [[What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?]] should about the novel, not the movie. This would require [[Whole Lotta Love|a whole lotta]] [[Special:WhatLinksHere|WhatLinksHere]] changes.   While I think this argument is balderdash, I've looked all over the place and I can't find any [[WP:policy|policy]] about article precedence of novels made into films.  What should I do next?&lt;br /&gt;
As always, your help and guidance sincerely appreciated!--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 12:02, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

: Typically, the less notable topic will go to the page with the qualifier in the title. I have no idea which one that is in this case, if you can't decide or there is a dispute about it you can make the current title into a disambiguation page, which could then also point to the song.&lt;br&gt;In any case someone will always have to go through all incoming links, and retarget them where needed&lt;br&gt;Now, the bunched-up edit links are a well known problem. They can be fixed (see [[Wikipedia:How to fix bunched-up edit links]]), but it's not trivial in this case, and once the article is split the problem will vanish anyway.&lt;br&gt;Hope that helps, [[User talk:Amalthea|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;font-variant:small-caps;color:#823824;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Amalthea&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:08, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

:: We conflicted at [[What Becomes of The Broken Hearted? (novel)]] just now I think. I had moved it to [[What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? (novel)]] per [[WP:NAME]] (notice the capitalization of the &quot;the&quot;), when you recreated it while adding the {{tlx|novel-stub}}. I'm thinking that this was only per accident? --[[User talk:Amalthea|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;font-variant:small-caps;color:#823824;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;Amalthea&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:47, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

== Irish Experiment ==

I have reverted your edit to the table on the [[Irish Experiment]].  I don't think that breaking this table into periods adds anything to the list in the article.  The list is too small for a start.  It effectively disables any meaningful sorting of columns.  Also the context of what you're trying to do is in the body text of the article.  You mentioned discussions with other wikipedians, however none of these appear on the articles discussion page. --[[User:Rulesfan|Rulesfan]] ([[User talk:Rulesfan|talk]]) 02:40, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

== Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis ==

Indeed there isn't a formal way to withdraw an AfD, so as long as you make it clear what you are doing you can't really go wrong!

What I'd do is:
# edit [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank Duckworth]] as follows
#* strikethrough your comment !Also Delete: Tony_Lewis_(mathematician), for substantially the same reasons as above.--Shirt58 (talk) 12:59, 27 June 2009 (UTC)&quot;
#* after this comment write something like '''withdraw Tony Lewis from ''this'' AfD''' - I think it will be better to consider his article separately (don't forget to sign!).
# nominate the [[Tony Lewis (mathematician)]] article for deletion in the normal way. In your nomination statement make sure to link to the Frank Duckworth AfD, note that Tony Lewis was previously considered there but you withdrew him from there to be considered separately here. Mote that the Frank Duckworth AfD will likely finish earlier than this one.
# edit the Frank Duckworth AfD again
#* Add a link to the Tony Lewis AfD after the comment you added a few moments ago.
#* At the bottom of the AfD make a statement something like: '''Note:''' I've removed Tony Lewis from this discussion and nominated him separately (brief reason) - see [link]. (sign!)
# optionally, put a note on the talk page of everyone who has commented on the Frank Duckworth AfD noting that Tony Lewis is now being considered separately.
#* If you do this, put a note to this effect on the Tony Lewis AfD. At the same time, if you didn't do it earlier, add the Tony Lewis AfD to the deletion sorting categories (cricket, living people, academics and educators, United Kingdom). 

Note that I have probably made it seem much more complicated than it actually is!

For future reference, when you added Tony Lewis to the Frank Duckworth AfD, you should have placed the AfD template on Tony Lewis' article.

== Referencing  wikicode help needed for edits in article [[Liberalism in Australia]] ==

{{tlp|helpme}}
Hi, all!&lt;br /&gt;
I'm trying to improve the referencing in the article [[Liberalism in Australia]].  Current Ref 4, a link to a speech by a former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian PM]] appears in the '''References''' section as &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[www.pm.gov.au/News/Speeches/speech1554.htm pm.gov.au_News_Speeches_speech2005]&quot; (in English). www.pm.gov.au/News/Speeches/speech1554.htm. Retrieved 2009-10-07.&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of the standard ref cite format.  I've tried seventeen different colours of re-referencing or work-arounds, but no dice.&lt;br /&gt;
As always, your guidance, help, and tech knowledge are sincerely and greatly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;

== Wisden v ICC Awards ==

I agree with you that there is sometimes a case for being flexible with &quot;See Also&quot; pages, but in the specific case of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] page I think that adding the Sobers Trophy link would be a bad idea. The reason is that there are dozens of cricketing awards given out every year, and if the Sobers link were added there would be no real reason not to add five or ten or twenty more. This would dilute the focussed nature of the Wisden page, and as it has been awarded Featured status I think it needs more careful watching in this (and other) regards than some pages. Of course, there's no reason why you shouldn't take this up at [[WT:CRIC]] if you still disagree.

I don't get the Zebedee reference you made, I'm afraid. I know it's from [[The Magic Roundabout]], but it doesn't seem to have any relevance to this discussion! [[User:Loganberry|Loganberry]] ([[User talk:Loganberry|Talk]]) 16:14, 11 October 2009 (UTC)

So far as I'm aware, there's no line in the sand for book covers- I know the number for album covers is that they should be less than 300x300px. Basically, reduce them to as small as you feel you can get away with. The default size in the article would seem to be a sensible size for the image; perhaps a little larger. As for your other images, tagging them for reduction until you or someone else can get around to resizing them would seem to be sensible.

== RL Laws flag/icons ==
Hmm. I'm not sure. I think it could be two different things: [[Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2010_March_28#Template:Country_data_World|the Country data World template's existence]] and the use of icons. Gnevin removed the template from the article and has nominated that template for deletion but does that make any different to the continued use of [[:File:World_Map_Icon.svg]]? I don't think it does - there are plenty of things that are used in WP without a template summoning them. [[Wikipedia:Template_substitution#Benefits_of_substitution]] mentions that subst might be used for templates that could be deleted or changed in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
But - could the nomination/deletion be used as an excuse to remove the icons? [[Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2010_March_28#Template:Country_data_World|The nomination]] says: &quot;''No longer used in the mainspace as per [[Template_talk:Country_data_World#Deprecated_for_mainspace_use]] and no need for it outside the main space any usages left should be subst''&quot;. Obviously, I challenge the comment that the template is no longer used in the mainspace - we were using it! The [[Template_talk:Country_data_World#Deprecated_for_mainspace_use|link in the nomination]] is merely to an assertion by John that &quot;''Per the discussion [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (icons)|here]] in December, this template should not be used in the mainspace (ie on articles)''&quot;. In that discussion between a handful of people, I see no particular aim/conclusion in the discussion to remove every instance of use - instead, the [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(icons)#Where_to_appropriately_use_.7B.7Bflag.7CWorld.7D.7D|intention of the discussion was to look for appropriate uses]]. John seems (from looking at his [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20100130221654&amp;limit=250&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Johnhis contributions on the dates leading up to 2010-01-28]) to have gone through every article using it and then the moment he had finished he states there are none left and marks the template as deprecated. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ACountry_data_World&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=340431006&amp;oldid=287009962][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AManual_of_Style_%28icons%29&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=340431255&amp;oldid=340107548] He made his last removal [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FIFA_09&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=340430574] just three minutes (00:44) before making the two edits above (00:47 and 00:48) - not exactly allowing time for opposing views.

:Hi, LL
:Ah, now it all makes a lot more sense.  It would appear that, in summary, the deletion of flag icons in the article was the tail end of something much larger.

== Re:E. vigintioctopunctata or H. vigintioctopunctata? ==

Nice to see you agian. It would seem that the Twenty Eight Spot Ladybird's correct scientific name is ''Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata'', and use to be ''Epilachna vigintioctopunctata''. Yet technically both are &quot;correct,&quot; the latter seems junior synonym, and most scientific journals use ''Henosepilachna'' instead. I would also like to point out just in case you would like to add this to the article, that ''Epilachna vigintioctopunctata'' is a [[Cryptic species complex|species complex]], and you could read more about this [http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2108/zsj.14.869 here]. Maybe it is just a coincidence, but I noticed, when referred to as a &quot;complex,&quot; I see ''Epilachna'' used instead.

I have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=rights&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3A{{PAGENAMEU}} granted] rollback rights to your account; the reason for this is that after a review of some of your contributions, I believe you can be trusted to use rollback correctly, and for its intended usage of ''reverting [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]'', and that you will not abuse it by reverting [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|good-faith]] edits or to [[Wikipedia:Edit war|revert-war]]. For information on rollback, see [[Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback]] and [[Wikipedia:Rollback feature]]. If you do not want rollback, just let me know, and I'll remove it. Good luck and thanks.

== About [[Derek Murawski]] ==

I helped write this page and believe the sources are solid; 2 newspaper articles, an interview with the subject on an established music site, and links to official postings with hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of views. The tone should be neutral, I have nothing to gain. I have edited it a little to make it seem less fan-y. I am asking if you can either delete your tags or maybe help make it the way you desired it to be by adding in more neutrality.

== Re: Jon Elia again ==

Thank you for the heads up about the article. I am not very active at Wikipedia that's why I did not answer before. Today I logged in after many months to remove an obvious vandalism and got your message.

The Urdu text that has been added to the article is Jon Elia's poetry. I can personally confirm that. I think it is from his first book, but I'll have to double-check that. The editor has put his poetry in the article in a way in which the location of this poetry in the article is very crucial. The piece of poetry from the subject's own work is an ironic reference to things mentioned in the lines just above Urdu text. This comes from the traditional style of Urdu essay writing. Urdu prose is often peppered with subtle poetic references which culminate at the inclusion of complete verses relevant to the topic being discussed.  The editor who added this poetry is obviously fond of Urdu literature.

Is it appropriate to do so based on Wikipedia's policies, practices and traditions? Or is it necessary to translate this Urdu text? This is for the Admins to decide. I'll try and add the references these verses if other's like to keep them for good. Translating poetry is often a difficult feat and usually results in unimpressive results as the translation looses the spirit and rhythm of actual work.

== Prodding BLPs ==

Hello, Shirt, and thanks for your note! Glad to know there are other people going through the backlog of unreferenced BLPs. I rescue some and prod others; there are all kinds of people in that backlog, from the obviously notable (cabinet secretaries) to the non-notable (vanity authors). You're right, it is interesting. I have &quot;met&quot; some real characters in that backlog!  

Feel free to remove the prod from [[Denise Lutgens]], and add a reference if you have one. I didn't find any references in a quick search but she certainly sounded like she could be notable if verification could be found. The article could use some cleaning up as well; at the very least it needs a proper lead sentence saying who/what she is (a Dutch pianist) and why she is notable. Something else to look out for in that article, now that I look at it: the line at the end saying she &quot;now&quot; attends that Gymnasium. I suspect that information is out of date (one of the reasons we are not supposed to use words like &quot;now&quot;, &quot;soon&quot;, etc.). 

About that message you got, &quot;Article was created before March 18, 2010, and is thus ineligible for a BLP PROD&quot;: I have been prodding older BLPs left and right and never got any such message. But I just looked it up at [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion of biographies of living people]] and here's the deal. It appears that there is a different rule and different tag for prodding more recent BLPs (since March 18, 2010). For those recent ones, they use a prod tag that CAN'T be removed unless a reliable source is added. That method is tagged using { { subst:prod blp } } . For earlier unsourced BLPs, I'm guessing we are supposed to simply use the generic { { subst:prod } } instead of { { subst:prod blp } }. That's what I do; I have never used the blp tag. Try the plain prod tag and see if that works. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 15:34, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

:I see that you did remove the prod from [[Denise Lutgens]] - but then you nominated her for deletion. I don't understand why you did that, since I though you were saying (on my talk page) that she was notable. In any case you should provide a comment at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Denise Lutgens]] to explain why you think the article should be deleted. Thanks. ----[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 13:38, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

Hi all, &lt;br&gt;
[[Wikipedia:Twinkle|Twinkle]] appears to have misfired - it's added the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{AfDM|page=Osnat Shurer|year=2010|month=September|day=23|substed=yes|help=off}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to the article, but there is no corresponding addition to the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2010 September 23|23 Sep 2010 AfD log]].  {{tlp|helpme}} I don't want to create a possible duplicate AfD, and I wouldn't have a clue how to fix the wikicode in the AfD log.  &lt;br&gt; Thank you! --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 12:03, 23 September 2010 (UTC)
:I'll fix it. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 12:37, 23 September 2010 (UTC)
::Actually, adding the template to the article is ''all'' that Twinkle seems to have done - it has not created the actual AfD page either. So I have removed the template from the article, and you are back to Square One - try again. If you have a problem, post again here. Regards, [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 12:43, 23 September 2010 (UTC)
:::Thanks indeed for the help - most appreciated, [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]]. A fellow [[:Category:Unreferenced BLPs|Unreferenced BLPs backlog]] gnome (hope you don't me calling you that, [[User:J04n]]) has added a reference, so I'm happy not to AfD the article.  Thanks again! --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 10:57, 24 September 2010 (UTC)

==Eugene &quot;Sdwig&quot; Zvidionny==
Hi Shirt58, I've declined your sticky prod for [[Eugene &quot;Sdwig&quot; Zvidionny]] because the article was written before the March 18 2010 cutoff. In fact it goes back to 2005, when rules about sourcing were much laxer. If you can't find references for him then you could still take it to AFD, though I suspect if you can translate from the Russian there'll be plenty of sources available. ''[[User:WereSpielChequers|&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkGreen&quot;&gt;?ere&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:WereSpielChequers|&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkRed&quot;&gt;Spiel&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkOrange&quot;&gt;Chequers''&lt;/span&gt; 23:41, 26 September 2010 (UTC)

== DLP ==

Where to begin? This is pretty basic knowledge for those in political history - The Age has made the mistake of confusing the year the last DLP members left the Senate (1974) with the last time they were elected (1970). Given that this is a basic fact and covered extensively in Wikipedia ([[Australian Senate election, 1970]], [[Australian federal election, 1974]], [[Vince Gair]], [[Members of the Australian Senate, 1971–1974]] and elsewhere), I considered that this didn't really need a cite. If you feel there is a need, though, by all means go ahead. Another reason for leaving it is finding an ideal cite, though - you can clearly see in many places that in 1974 no DLP Senators were elected, while in 1970 (the Senate election immediately previous) they were. With the corresponding link to the 1970 election, I find a cite somewhat redundant, but as I said, I'm not really fussed about it.

== Labor split ==

This subject is ''well'' overdue for an article (also the previous splits in 1916 and 1931), so I'm glad you've done it! I think you've made a great start. On titles, I think [[Australian Labor Party split, 1955]] is probably best; I'm also not sure about calling it the &quot;Labor Split&quot; in the lead, since there have been three major ones and quite a few little ones. The statement that Santamaria and Mannix felt that Hitler was better than Stalin is quite controversial and will certainly need a dedicate citation. There's also a new book out dedicated to the split that might be helpful (I can't recall it's title right now, but I'll check next time at my library). On the suggested subtitles:
*The Queensland split definitely requires its own section, but it should be made clear that the [[Queensland Labor Party]] was a separate entity from the DLP and was not even formally affiliated.
*Again, possibly speaking in ignorance here, but is Petrov directly relevant to the split? I know it furthered the tensions between the two emerging factions, but I'm not sure if it warrants its own subsection.
Otherwise, looking great and I'm looking forward to seeing this article grow! I'll try to help out with some sources and things when I'm back within reach of them (later this week). [[User:Frickeg|Frickeg]] ([[User talk:Frickeg|talk]]) 13:00, 3 October 2010 (UTC)

== Ukrainian Saamis ==

Hi, you reverted my edit on the Saami page about the Ukrainian Saamis. While I agree that deleting data because it is &quot;wrong&quot; is not proper conduct, I am also struggling to think of any possible reason for the information to be there in the first place. One hundred and thirty six people does not make a notable piece of information make, especially when the data was last current before Wikipedia itself existed. Besides which, the information was not referred to at any point in the article, and I cannot conceive of a situation where my deleting said data could possibly inconvenience a reader. I will not get into an edit war, but I hope you can at least see my points - I edited the article in the honest belief that I was in no way lowering the quality or useful information of the page, and I stand by this opinion. --[[Special:Contributions/160.5.228.48|160.5.228.48]] ([[User talk:160.5.228.48|talk]]) 12:38, 9 October 2010 (UTC)

== About the Suzuki's text ==
Dear user Shirt58:
I think you are right and I should have specified a particular reason in the edit summary or somewhere for removing content from the article. But I wouldn't go all the way to call it a vandalism for it is written in a different language. That link does not belong to Mr. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akira_Suzuki_(chemist)&amp;diff=390638031&amp;oldid=390472838 Suzuki's text]. Someone made a short article about [http://fa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D8%A7%DB%8C_%D8%A7%DB%8C%DA%86%DB%8C_%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B4%DB%8C&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=3913027 Ei-ichi Negishi] in the Persian wiki but mistakenly made all the links to Akira Suzuki which has no article in the Persian Wikipedia yet (it is written from right to left and the left edit is the newer). So I had to remove it from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akira_Suzuki_(chemist)&amp;diff=390638031&amp;oldid=390472838 Suzuki's] links and add it to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ei-ichi_Negishi&amp;diff=390639901&amp;oldid=390190058 Negishi's] and it was a right thing to do. Users (global) contributions show if they are vandalists or not. Apparently it caused a small misunderstanding but it is OK now and I hope we are back on track again. Thank you.

== Reply ==
Yes, I'd love to :) I also have some sources (although less specialised). I agree with you about the importance of the topic - it's kind of surprising in a way that it hadn't had an article all this time.

What I've always found most odd about the 1955 split was that although it had major impacts with the creation of a conservative &quot;balance of power&quot; federally, it only seriously split the Labor Party in one state - Victoria - and had almost negligible impact in Tasmania and WA where Labor were at that time in government (the WA Labor Party were dominated by economically left wing, socially conservative Catholics so there was no obvious point to split on, and I suspect the same was true in Tasmania.) Queensland was its own weird case where long-running tensions over whether the Premier or Trades Hall should lead the party split it in two. The national splits were always weird - the 1916-17 split completely bypassed Tasmania while the split in WA was not even over conscription. 

One other odd thing while it occurs to me, is that the two splits, while damaging in the short and medium term to the ALP's prospects, made it into a more unified party. At each stage, they lost conservative, right-wing elements who had drifted into the ALP through unionism rather than ideological sympathy. In Victoria the size of the split drove the remainder of the ALP so far to the left that the Federal party had to take it over in 1970 to make them electable nationally.

== [[Imperial Block]] ==

Hi, Shirt! You asked me whether the mention of the National Register of Historic Places made this building into an automatic &quot;keep,&quot; and suggested you might withdraw the nomination if that was the case. I don't think you need to do that. I posted the following comment at the AfD discussion:
:'''Comment''' I have seen other users say that anything on the National Register of Historic Places is automatically notable, but I can't find a WP guideline that says so. Even if that is policy it might not apply here, since the Imperial Block is not a standalone listing on the National Register; it is one of the buildings that make up the Butte Historic District. So I would say this is a judgment call whether the building is notable or not, and should be based on the sources - only one of which is its inclusion in the Butte Historic District. I couldn't find any source describing what the building is used for now; that might be relevant. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 17:39, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

::&quot;Rescued&quot; to a redirect? 0;-D  I don't think I'll give myself credit for a rescue on this one (although I do pride myself on my rescues). About schools, at least that consensus is written down somewhere, at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes#Education]]. The &quot;National Register&quot; tradition makes perfect sense to me, but offhand I couldn't find it in writing anywhere. I think I'll continue to use it, however! --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 15:20, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

[edit] Ref desk - writing quote found
I feel a little lazy hearing how you found the quote I was searching for ... I must have a low frustration tolerance. Thanks again, nonetheless!

If you have the inclination to acquaint yourself with Dillard, I think you're in for a treat. Especially Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Teaching a stone to talk, or her autobiography, An American Childhood. 198.161.238.18 (talk) 16:43, 27 November 2009 (UTC)

[edit] Thanks.
Cheers for the swift and accurate reply re the Faroe Isles. I thought no-one else knew they existed ! Really strange about the Danes paying for the tunnels too, I never knew that.

[edit] Plymouth
Thanks for writing more detail about Plymouth's history. I think the history section is now as big and detailed as it should get. We have a history of Plymouth article for extra details. The article is currently a &quot;good article&quot;, which means its reliability needs to be maintained. In my opinion, citing Plymouth Data is fine. I checked up about that ages ago on Wikipedia and other users said that other sources should be used, if available i.e. historical books, but that otherwise Plymouth Data is &quot;okay&quot;. Cyber-heritage, however, is not reliable. Do you have any other sources you could use for that one? Jolly O Janner 19:19, 14 January 2010 (UTC)

[edit] Tolmers Scout Camp
An article that you created, Tolmers Scout Camp has been proposed for merging into the region article Scouting in East of England. I did not make this proposal, but I found a meregto tag on the article, and agreed with it, so I am doing the work on it. I have added the mergefrom to the target article, adviced the Scouting Project and now you, and will add justification for the merge soon to Talk:Scouting in East of England. Please comment there when I have done so. --Bduke (Discussion) 02:02, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

[edit] news
[show]The WORCESTERSHIRE Project Newsletter - March 2010 
The WikiProject WORCESTERSHIRE Newsletter
No. 2 - March 2010
(Archived here.)

  
Morgan car factory main entrance, Malvern Link, Worcestershire 
Welcome to the second WikiProject Worcestershire newsletter 
You are probably receiving this because you have significantly contributed to one of our pages. If you are not yet a participant in the Worcestershire project, now is the time to consider joining - it might help you get some assistance on a page you feel particularly attached to.
Here goes for the second irregular news bulletin...

First GA in 2010 
We finally got over our euphoria over the Malvern, Worcestershire promotion to Good Article status. The GA sets a benchmark for the quality to be targeted for other articles in the project, and clearly demonstrated how important teamwork is.

Recently founded 
A lot of work has already been done since the Worcs project was started, including the recent tagging of the talk pages of all the articles about people connected with Worcestershire, keeping spam and vandalism at bay, and welcoming new editors on their talk pages.

Experts needed! 
The Worcestershire project mainly concerns settlements. It's generally agreed that the immediate priority now is to improve the articles that shiould be the flagships of the project, namely Worcester, and Worcestershire which are some of the articles in the worst state.

Meet up 
Kudpung has booked his flight from Asia and will be back in Malvern from 1 April for a month, and looks forward to meeting up with as many Wikipedians as possible, especially those who work on the Worcs project.

NEWS 
Two major debates are raging on the 'pedia and we have been cautiously taking part.

WP:BLP (Biography of Living Persons) 
In for a shake up is an accumulation of nearly 50,000 totally unsourced articles that may end up on the cutting room floor after a period of grace. As a project, we can help by taking a look at those BLP in the county and doing what we can before the axe falls.

citations 
A war almost broke out over citation formats, but a mature approach from Worcs project members prevented any physical injury. There, are only three basic rules for citations: 1. All articles must have them. 2. Consitency of format throughout an articles. 3. Changes to the format require a consensus.
We are not obliged to use citation templates, and WP:LDR might not be such a good idea while chunks of text and/or their references are being copied and pasted around related articles in the county. In any case, let's always discuss what we have in mind HERE.

new project pages 
The project main page has been pruned to be cleaner, and much of the support material has been transferred to dedicated pages. New usefull banners and templates have been created, and shortcuts to the new pages that also include a side bar navigator and a brand new easily edited To Do list.

new participant 
After all the hints getting him to join, we now welcome User:wotnow !

sysop (admin) 
Our only admin has resigned his tools. It would be great to have an active admin as a member of the project. If you think you would be able to cope with all the responsibility adminship involves, checkout WP:RfA and nominate yourself. Nobody needs to have a high edit count or to be an expert in all areas, but being active, having a reasonable overview of the workings of the Wikipedia, and a decent level of maturity, are expected minima. The process is not painless, and is worse than a British army promotion board! Alternatively you can always nominate another user.

Happy Wikying, and thanks to everyone else who has contributed to our articles.
 New project resources 
Before making any major edits to articles or stubs, please be sure to read the new WP:WORCS/HowTo. Urgent tasks are now listed at: WP:WORCS/ToDo. It should be referred to often, and will be your main stop for most maintenance tasks. We recommend keeping the page on your watchlist. Most project pages now have brand new side bar for easy navigation. (Thanks, GyroMagician). Priority Articles== The top priority articles have been identified as probably being:

Worcester • Worcestershire • Bromsgrove • Redditch • Kidderminster • Pershore • Malvern St James • Droitwich • tenbury Wells and the suite of former QinetiQ establlishments: * TRE • RSRE • DERA 
The number has been kept deliberately low to give us a fighting chance of improving them to at least GA status, so we can concentrate our efforts on these first. Priorities are not set in stone and if you would like to discuss changes, please join in at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Worcestershire.

Other priorities:

The recommended priority by kind is for creation/improvement of complete articles is: 
Places in the county 
Schools in the county (Particularly susceptible to vandalism - please keep them on your watch lists if possible). 
Transport in the county 
Notable buildings/objects/geo features/AONB/Heritage sites, etc. in the county 
History in the county 
Industry &amp; Commerce in the county. 
People in the county - NOTE: These all need the Worcs project banner adding to their talk pages, and assessing. 
County related articles about things not actually in the county, and/or other related projects. 
These lists will help:

All Worcs related articles by ABC 
Worcs related articles by type. 
All Worcs related articles about people by ABC 
List of all Schools in Worcestershire 
List by Class &amp; Importance: Page 1 All categories except people (not yet tagged with WP banner) 
List by Class &amp; Importance: Page 2 All categories except people (not yet tagged with WP banner). 
New Aims 
Specific aims for the project are:-

Monitor
The watchlist to keep an eye on changes to the project's articles so that vandalism and spamming can be removed as quickly as possible. 
Infoboxes
Some of our articles need their infoboxes completing infobox. 
References
Please remember that the list of stubs needing expansion is always in need of attention. Please take a look and see if you can help. One small edit, such as adding a reference section and reference, to an article each session would make a big difference. If you are uploadiing an image, be sure it has a correct FUR, and that you have preferably already created a link on the page where you want it to be. 
Moves, merges, and multiple edits
Please be careful when performing articles moves and check if anyone seems to be in the middle of doing the same thing. If he; she, or they are, stop and have a chat about it. Otherwise you may be unintentionally duplicating or reverting each other's work. This is particularly important if an article is currently under a GA review. image may be deleted as it has an incorrect FUR.

Apropos your comment on &quot;Nigeroise,&quot; Jacques Barzun, in one of his books, notes that Rouget de Lisle's song that became the French anthem was popularized by guys from Marseilles, but was in fact composed at the request of another city.

== Template ==

I removed it because that template was added when I was in the process of editing it (it was saved uncompleted at that time). There is nothing I find objectionable in the article according to Wikipedia's policies. Yes, it does lack references, but HOW can you add references in an article simply stating a list? There's no need for references or citations in such list articles.

== Re: Australian Labor Party split of 1955 ==

Hi Shirt58, if you want to create a sandbox for that article, do it in your userspace, not in the main namespace. But I don't see too much of a problem with working on the article as it is now. Working on two pages at once would create attribution issues (i.e. in recording who actually wrote each piece of text). I don't know much about the subject; I only found the article while randomly reading about [[Daniel Mannix]]. However I'll be happy to help out with copyedits and things like that.

== MARA acronym dab page and original MARA page ==

{{Helpme-helped}}
Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;
Two government organisations, the Malaysian [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]] and the Australian [[Migration Agents Registration Authority]] are commonly known by the acronym &quot;MARA&quot;. As there is no article &quot;MARA&quot;, I started a disambig page [[MARA (disambiguation)]], his would appear to be the correct things to do.  Internal search for &quot;MARA&quot; still leads directly to [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Majlis Amanah Rakyat&lt;br /&gt;
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;br /&gt;
(Redirected from [[MARA]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
How do I catch the initial redirect?  Or - and it's a very real possibility - am I completely wrong about this? &lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again! --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 10:43, 26 October 2010 (UTC)
:No, you are not completely wrong at all. However, all you needed to do was to rewrite [[MARA]] as a disambiguation page. It is much better not to name the disambig page [[MARA (disambiguation)]] if there is no other article called simply [[MARA]], as &quot;MARA&quot; is what people are likely to search for, not &quot;MARA (disambiguation)&quot;. I have moved the disambiguation page to [[MARA]]. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 11:28, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

Hi, you nominated a lot of national bandy teams for deletion today, but it does appear as if the vast majority (if not all) of them meet notability requirements, and I have even begun to add references. I was wondering if you'd like to reconsider your nominations in light of the fact I have found sources. [[User:Redfarmer|Redfarmer]] ([[User talk:Redfarmer|talk]]) 13:07, 30 October 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;notes&quot; section for image files on commons? ==

Hey all,&lt;br /&gt;
The article [[Genesis Suite]] currently has a number of &quot;see copy in the commons&quot; mentions. Those mentions have been arguably adequately referenced in the main referencing of the article; what is needed is link/s to those commons files.  So, how do I do this? {{tl|helpme}}--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 13:10, 10 November 2010 (UTC)
:Hi Shirt58. You can [[WP:PIPE|pipe]] a link to the commons images referred to. To pipe a link directly to a commons media file without having the file display, you simply need to prefix a colon in the link code. So, for example, where it says in the article currently &quot;see copy in the commons&quot;, you might change this to &quot;see &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:exact name file|copy in the commons]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. I assume all of the images of the documents are in the [[Commons:Category:Genesis Suite|Commons category for Genesis Suite]]. Here I am attempting to provide a mechanical solution to your question, but I'm not 100% sure the article's in-text referral to these images is the best way to go.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 13:30, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

==Page created by blocked user==
Thanks for tagging [[Foolkit Australia]] for deletion as a page created by a banned or blocked user. I have deleted the article and blocked the account that created it. However, it is worth mentioning that it took me some time to find the blocked account in question, and I wouldn't have blamed any admin who just declined the speedy deletion for want of evidence. It is worth indicating what blocked user you are referring to: Just a couple of words in an edit summary are enough.

== Speedy deletion declined: [[:Screenwise]] ==
Hello Shirt58. I am just letting you know that I declined the speedy deletion of [[:Screenwise]], a page you tagged for speedy deletion, because of the following concern: '''The article is not substantially the same as the deleted version. A new [[WP:XFD|deletion discussion]] is required.'''  Thank you.  —&amp;nbsp;[[User:Malik Shabazz|Malik Shabazz]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Malik Shabazz|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Malik Shabazz|Stalk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 05:43, 14 February 2011 (UTC)

==Added template for [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]]==
Hi,

Thanks for being one of [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's]] users!  I hope you have found the bot's suggestions useful.

We are in the process of switching from our previous list-based signup process to using templates and userboxes, and I have therefore added the appropriate template to your user talk page.  You should receive the first set of suggestions within a day, and since we'll be automating SuggestBot you will from then on continue to receive them regularly at the desired frequency.

We now also have a userbox that you can use to let others know you're using SuggestBot, and if you don't want to clutter your user talk page the bot can post to a sub-page in your userspace.  More information about the userbox and usage of the template is available on [[User:SuggestBot/Getting Recommendations Regularly]].

If there are any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me on my user talk page.  Thanks again, [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]) 21:59, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

==Toto's Pizza House==

Could you please help me. I created the page Toto's Pizza House and then moved it to User:Pestbuda\Toto's Pizza House, and on realising I used the wrong slash moved it to User:Pestbuda/Toto's Pizza House. I've tried to move it to Toto's Pizza House and have been told I cannot. Could you please help me move it to just Toto's Pizza House. There are a lot of things I need to put on it but if it can be put on WP proper I think it will be OK. I've also put links, which was a silly thing for me to do before creating the article.

If you could help me I'd be very appreciative, or if you cannot suggest another administrator familiar with this problem, which must have occurred before. Thank you.[[User:Pestbuda|Pestbuda]] ([[User talk:Pestbuda|talk]]) 12:23, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

[[Meyer Children's Hospital of Florence]] is the existing article, but the better title would be  [[Meyer Children's Hospital]] - it's the one that [[it:Ospedale Pediatrico Meyer]] links to, it's the direct transltion, and would appear to be the better choice per [[WP:TITLE]].  So here's the question: if I copy all the info in [[Meyer Children's Hospital of Florence]] to [[Meyer Children's Hospital]], and make [[Meyer Children's Hospital of Florence]] a [[WP:REDIRECT]] to [[Meyer Children's Hospital]], is that going to fuddle both pages' edit histories?--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 10:58, 25 February 2011 (UTC)
:Yes, it is. What it needs is to delete the new one per A10 and move the old one to that title leaving a redirect. I'll just check there are no problems, and then do that. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 11:12, 25 February 2011 (UTC)
::Ha! I beat you to it, JohnCD! I was just coming here to let you now I had done it, Shirt85, and also to suggest that in future the best way to deal with this situation is to tag the article to be deleted with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-move|page to be moved|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

::(edit-conflict) JBW got there first.  For future reference: you were quite right to ask before copying the information across. That's called a [[WP:Cut and paste move]] and causes problems with the history, which we have to maintain because the license terms require maintaining attribution for all contributions. If the destination doesn't exist, you can do a &quot;move&quot;; if it does, you need admin assistance because the move involves deleting what is at the target address.

A tag has been placed on [[:Marcus lane]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Marcus lane|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Marcus lane|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:E Wing|E Wing]] ([[User talk:E Wing|talk]]) 09:47, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:St mary's forane church]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]].

== Notification: changes to &quot;Mark my edits as minor by default&quot; preference ==
{{done}}
Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled &quot;Mark all edits minor by default&quot;, which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse ([[Help_talk:Minor_edit#Should_we_remove_the_Preference_setting_to_.22Mark_all_edits_minor_by_default.22_.3F|consensus discussion]], guidelines for use at [[WP:MINOR]]). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and all users will still be able to manually mark their edits as being minor in the usual way. 

For well-established users such as yourself there is '''[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_default_asked_to_be_removed_in_bugzilla:24313|a workaround available]]''' involving custom JavaScript.

Yes Peter, I would very much appreciate you offer of assitance in regard to correctly creating sub-pages. What I write seems to disappear with an explaination that I should be using a sandbox which I would have thought that I am already doing (but obviously not - so hence the confusion. I seem to be also having some connectivity problem - when I use the Show preview or Save page functions it seems to go into an endless wait period for wikipedia to respond - but no local connectivity problems. I'm now at an internet cafe and the same problem here (Show preview doesn't work)but at home both Show preview and Save page doesn't work - is this something to do with Wikipedia or something I'm doing wrong.?

I hope that, in time, I may be able to contribute towards Wikipedia - but for now bogged down in the sandbox stage.

Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;
{{tn|helpme}} I'm currently working on the [[List of Kangxi radicals]] project, and have translated some text from [[:ja:康熙字典|the corresponding Japanese Wikipedia project]]. As far as I am aware, I can't simply translate from wp:ja without attribution, as it would be a violation of the [[CC-BY-SA 3.0]] License and the [[GFDL]].  Could some fellow Wikipedian possibly give me some guidance about this?

== Kangxi radical articles ==
Peter,
* Actually, I was '''completely''' unaware of the [[Jyutping]] romanization system for [[Cantonese]]! Nonetheless, I think having a modern romanization method is a good idea, as it makes for good comparison opportunities with the older and more pervasive [[Yale romanization]] system (sort of like [[Pinyin]] vs. [[Wade-Giles]]). As for adding a Jyutping category to the infobox, that'd be a wonderful addition but I have no idea how to parse the scripting used for mediawiki templates. :(

* Well, including ''all'' possible readings for [[hiragana]], [[kanji]], [[hangul]] and [[hanja]] transliterations might be overkill, so I guess I tend to lean towards only including first-mentioned ones from the ja: articles. It'd be nice to have an idea which readings are most common ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] words have [[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on]] and [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun]] readings, so having at least one example of both such readings seems adequate to me. I think [[Korean language|Korean]] has the equivalent of on and kun but I have less knowledge about that language in general.

* This is something that I'm still trying to figure out myself. I'd like to add all such information if feasible but so far I can't tell how I'm going to go about that.
:Okay, I just found this article section about Chinese characters of Korean origin (known as [[Hanja#Yakja|Yakja]]). It looks like only specialized terms and personal names use this written form, thus the reason for only romanized entries in the Sino-Korean section of radical infoboxes (i.e., the written radicals are unchanged when used in Korean). Cheers! [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 15:53, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

Just a couple of other points: I'd like to get someone good with mediawiki/template scripting to add the functionality used in the German wikipedia's radicals infobox that shows links (as a radical number) to the previous and next radical articles with triangles as guide arrows. Having this feature would help in navigating these articles while making content additions to them. Also, please don't convert the external links into inline sources in reference to the number of characters a particular radical is based on, as I got that information from en: wikipedia's [[List of Kangxi radicals]] article and not the [[Han unification|Unihan]] database (no biggie, but I don't want to cause source confusion). Regards, [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 14:38, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

===Re: Back to business===

Okay, I saw that you updated the Kangxi Radical Infobox ''documentation'' but not the template itself. After testing the template in my personal sandbox, I found that updating it wasn't as difficult as I initially thought it would be. There are now usable entries for [[Jyutping]] and [[Yale Romanization#Cantonese|Cantonese Yale]] for the infobox! I also updated the article ([[Radical 211]]) used as the example in the template documentation. Cheers! :) [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 13:43, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

== Requirements for attribution for translations from Wikipedias in languages other than English ==
{{done}}
Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;
{{tn|helpme}} I'm currently working on the [[List of Kangxi radicals]] project, and have translated some text from [[:ja:康熙字典|the corresponding Japanese Wikipedia project]]. As far as I am aware, I can't simply translate from wp:ja without attribution, as it would be a violation of the [[CC-BY-SA 3.0]] License and the [[GFDL]].  Could some fellow Wikipedian possibly give me some guidance about this?
As always, colleagues, thanks all for all your ongoing help! --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 12:01, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

:Hi. It's fine to translate from the jawiki article, as long as you say where it came from. You can do that with a message on the talk page - and there are templates to help.

== Kangxi radical articles ==
Peter,
* Actually, I was '''completely''' unaware of the [[Jyutping]] romanization system for [[Cantonese]]! Nonetheless, I think having a modern romanization method is a good idea, as it makes for good comparison opportunities with the older and more pervasive [[Yale romanization]] system (sort of like [[Pinyin]] vs. [[Wade-Giles]]). As for adding a Jyutping category to the infobox, that'd be a wonderful addition but I have no idea how to parse the scripting used for mediawiki templates. :(

* Well, including ''all'' possible readings for [[hiragana]], [[kanji]], [[hangul]] and [[hanja]] transliterations might be overkill, so I guess I tend to lean towards only including first-mentioned ones from the ja: articles. It'd be nice to have an idea which readings are most common ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] words have [[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on]] and [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun]] readings, so having at least one example of both such readings seems adequate to me. I think [[Korean language|Korean]] has the equivalent of on and kun but I have less knowledge about that language in general.

* This is something that I'm still trying to figure out myself. I'd like to add all such information if feasible but so far I can't tell how I'm going to go about that.
:Okay, I just found this article section about Chinese characters of Korean origin (known as [[Hanja#Yakja|Yakja]]). It looks like only specialized terms and personal names use this written form, thus the reason for only romanized entries in the Sino-Korean section of radical infoboxes (i.e., the written radicals are unchanged when used in Korean). Cheers! [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 15:53, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

Just a couple of other points: I'd like to get someone good with mediawiki/template scripting to add the functionality used in the German wikipedia's radicals infobox that shows links (as a radical number) to the previous and next radical articles with triangles as guide arrows. Having this feature would help in navigating these articles while making content additions to them. Also, please don't convert the external links into inline sources in reference to the number of characters a particular radical is based on, as I got that information from en: wikipedia's [[List of Kangxi radicals]] article and not the [[Han unification|Unihan]] database (no biggie, but I don't want to cause source confusion). Regards, [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 14:38, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

===Re: Back to business===

Okay, I saw that you updated the Kangxi Radical Infobox ''documentation'' but not the template itself. After testing the template in my personal sandbox, I found that updating it wasn't as difficult as I initially thought it would be. There are now usable entries for [[Jyutping]] and [[Yale Romanization#Cantonese|Cantonese Yale]] for the infobox! I also updated the article ([[Radical 211]]) used as the example in the template documentation. Cheers! :) [[User:Bumm13|Bumm13]] ([[User talk:Bumm13|talk]]) 13:43, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

==Re:known from..==
Hmm, okay, I could find another phrase to use I guess. What about &quot;it is found in&quot;. I think &quot;native to&quot; still suggest it occurs in that country naturally, while it might be an introduced species. Like I replied to [[User:Choyoołʼįįhí:Seb az86556]] though: I really think it is okay, if I search for &quot;known from Europe&quot; on google I get a lot of scientific articles about species. For instance: &quot;The genus Myrmecina is known from Europe&quot;, &quot;The species indicated by an asterisk are known from Europe&quot;, &quot;Actidium baccarinii is known from Europe&quot;, etc. so it might be science lingo? But okay, I will switch to &quot;is found in&quot;. One thing though.. I made about 15,000 species articles on wikipedia in the course of a few years and used &quot;is known from&quot; countless times. I am not going back to change all of that. If it is really gramatically incorrect, a bot might be able to correct it.
On an unrelated note: I noticed you link the authorities sometimes, thanks for that! But if you do, please mind the brackets. If there are no brackets, i.e. Meyrick, 1910, it means the species has not been transferred to another genus. If brackets are used, i.e. (Meyrick, 1910), it means the species was described in another genus but was transferred later. So I would like to ask not to add brackets when linking the authority (unless I made a mistake offcourse). Cheers!

I don't think I am anywhere near that standard, yet - I hope to achieve such a standard though however, it's only been 1 month since registering at Wikipedia - a lot more to learn.

I come from Coonabarabran NSW - half-way between Melbourne and Brisbane - offically the Astronomy Capital of Australia.

My toes are quite resiliant!

Yes, I'd rather these articles were improved. I made a point of going through them all (I may have missed a few) when they appeared on NPP, to avoid the contributor being hit with a dozen invalid CSD-A7 notifications and being scared off for good. The subjects surely must be covered ''somewhere'' in more detail than is currently referenced. Normally I'd do a little investigating myself, but I don't really have the time at the moment. 

Hopefully he'll come back and expand them now that he's been pointed in the right direction.

A tag has been placed on [[:Isff]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia for multiple reasons. '''Please see the page to see the reasons'''. If the page has since been deleted, you can ask me the reasons by leaving a message on [[User talk:Kgorman-ucb|my user talk page]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Isff|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you.

== {{article|Ben McKay (actor)}} ==

The article {{article|Ben McKay (actor)}} was deleted by AFD for notability: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ben McKay (actor)]].  But that was back in 2007, and this version of the article is more substantial, so this recreation shouldn't fall under G4.  (Someone could still renominate for AFD if they wanted.)  Recreation of talk pages doesn't really matter - a talk page should exist only if the article exists.  If an article exists it's always fine for a talk page to exist regardless of previous deletions.

== Santa Barbara Tax Products Group ==

Re. the now-archived [[User talk:Chzz/Archive 31#About: Santa Barbara Tax Products Group and User talk:EC Cyclopedia]]

(I had some 'issues' with my talk page, so things got archived)

I think what you did was fine; sorry I was unable to help at the time - but, yes, seems OK. Keeping things short and thus a 'necessary oversimplification' is most effective, I think. And whilst we have to be careful not to BITE, there's also the often-quoted &quot;[[WP:AGF|AGF]] is not a suicide pact&quot; - ie, is the user ''actually'' here to improve the project, or just to plug their company (an [[WP:SPA|SPA]], unlikely to be a net positive). I wrote a thingy (unfinished), [[User:Keegan/Butterfly]].

About the only suggestion I would make is, to always emphasize that they should read [[WP:BFAQ]] - which is a great guide, in those cases.

Dealing with COI is certainly hard work, and can be very demoralizing - but I don't think you crossed a line to bite, at all; I think your response was fine. Keep up the good stuff. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid;background:#00008B&quot;&gt;[[User:Chzz|'''&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00008B;color:white&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chzz&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']][[User talk:Chzz|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00008B;background-color:yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;►&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 18:18, 12 May 2011 (UTC)

== Monotheism ==

Hello Peter,

The article I edited on Monotheism,Hebrew Bible section, is an actual unproven fact,and an opinion,rather than evidence.The statement states that Genesis 1 alludes to Enuma Elish.In fact this is incorrect,and you can check both accounts.There is similarity of origin stories,however no one can confirm yet who borrowed from who.In regards,this statement starts out by saying Genesis 1 is borrowed from the Enuma Elish. How can this be a fact? It is still disputed,and so forth.This is a piece that atheist use to attack Judeo,Islamic,and Christian faith.Taking one side of the story,and presenting it as a fact under the Hebrew Bible section,is politically incorrect.I ask that you would examine it again,and attest to it.

Regards,

(Mark)

==Plea for help: Concerto for Trombone==
Hello, Peter.
You provided some help to me when I rewrote the article [[Genesis Suite]] which you created, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could help me with an article on another Shilkret classical composition, [[Trombone Concerto (Shilkret)]].
I wrote the article in June 2010 and included a table of concert performances of the piece. More than a dozen people have made useful small edits of the article since then. Two days ago [[Melodia]] deleted the entire table.
It is common for wikipedia articles on musical compositions to list their usages. The frequency of usage and the stature of the artists, motion pictures and other users of the work provide documentation of the importance of the composition. As an example I looked at [[1931 in music]] (the year chosen at random from a period with which I am somewhat familiar). Links to many of the songs listed, e.g., [[Dream a Little Dream of Me]], [[Heartaches]], and [[I Don't Know Why]] give fairly extensive lists of recordings (with no references).
For the Concerto for Trombone, the most extensive modern usage is in concerts, where it has been performed by noted soloists and concert orchestras worldwide, and the list of performances thus provides useful documentation of the importance of the  composition and belongs in the article. My stated source of information is the contracts these organizations enter into in order to perform the composition. Again using the [[1931 in music]] article for comparison, I followed the link to Stravinsky's [[Violin Concerto (Stravinsky)|Violin Concerto in D]] to find the premiere performance was listed with no reference. I have copies of the contracts, but for privacy reasons I can not include complete copies of the contracts on the wikipedia commons.
I reverted the deletion of the table, and [[Melodia]] deleted it again. Is there a way I can appeal this? Thank you for any help or advice you might have. You are welcome to reply in my talk page or yours as you find convenient. [[User:Niel Shell|Niel Shell]] ([[User talk:Niel Shell|talk]]) 18:08, 11 January 2011 (UTC)
If, as seems likely, you had a hand in starting the discussion in [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Classical music#Listing off all performances]] concerning my list of performances, thank you for giving me a forum to present my case.

== Proposed deletion of [[Sydney Wade]] ==

I see that you restored a PROD template which had been removed from [[Sydney Wade]]. However, a PROD is only for uncontroversial deletion proposals. If anyone at all removes a PROD template then presumably they think the article should not be deleted, and so it is clearly not uncontroversial. For this reason, a PROD template may not be restored once it has been removed. There are a few exceptions, obvious vandalism being one of them, and I see that you used an edit summary which referred to &quot;vandalism&quot;. However, it does not seem to me to be obvious vandalism: as far as I can see it may well be a user who genuinely thinks the article should not be deleted, and in the absence of unambiguous evidence to the contrary we have to assume so. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 09:51, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
:For what it's worth, I actually think there's a good chance that the PROD removal was not done in good faith. I think it may well have been block evasion by the author of the article, and if so restoring the tag was justified. However, we have no actual evidence for that, so we have to give the benefit of the doubt.  [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 10:32, 13 July 2011 (UTC)

:One more comment. I have just seen your original post to the IP talk page. You refer there to a Biographies of Living Persons PROD, but this was an ordinary PROD, not a BLP PROD. I know you are an experienced editor, so you may well already know this, but in case you don't, the two kinds of PRODs are quite different. It is perfectly correct to restore a BLP PROD that has been removed without sources being added to the article, but only in exceptional circumstances can an ordinary PROD be restored.

The article [[Herman F. Becker]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''non-notable person.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Herman F. Becker|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]] ([[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]) - 18:38, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, '''[[:Battle of malpura]]'''. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - '''[[:Battle of Malpura]]'''. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for [[WP:A10|speedy deletion]]. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at [[:Battle of Malpura]] - you might like to discuss new information at [[Talk:Battle of Malpura|the article's talk page]]. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Battle of malpura|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the [[WP:AFC|article creation process]] and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 10:20, 31 July 2011 (UTC)

== [[Koljo Karagiosov]] ==

I replied at the AfD that agree with the comment you made.  However, there are other problems going on with the author of the article.  User [[User:Eliiva|Eliiva]] has [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Special:Contributions/Eliiva created 4 other articles] that are similar to Karagiosov.  I see you tried to Speedy Delete some of the articles, but an IP address (Eliiva?) removed them.  They also removed the AfD tag form Karagiosov multiple times.  I've warned the IP address not to remove the tags.  I re-added the speedy tags to [[Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov]] and [[Stefan Nedev Karagiosov]] that were removed improperly.  However, I don't think they will be speedy removed.  References in Bulgarian have been added to all the articles, but they are all the same references.  Most would be very hard to verify.  A couple are on-line, but can't be used with Google translate.  I've asked some Bulgarian speaking editors for help.  I'd wager that all 5 articles will end up deleted, but I've been wrong too many times to count. [[User:Bgwhite|Bgwhite]] ([[User talk:Bgwhite|talk]]) 07:23, 3 August 2011 (UTC)
::you have both turned out to be wrong. Pls see the afd, which you initiated, and might want to withdraw.  G translate worked just fine for me. To translate the second pt of a long article, just paste it in separately.  So did it on the Bulgarian wikipedia. I want to mention to both of you that speedy A3 is for ''blatant'' hoaxes only.  '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 19:32, 3 August 2011 (UTC)
:::I've only re-added the speedy delete tag because it was removed by the creating editor.  I'm not an administrator and don't feel comfortable removing speedy delete.  When Shirt58 added the speedy delete, there were no references or external links.  Shirt58 should have done a Prod first or worded the AfD better.  However, the AfD was added with one of the reasonings being it fails [[WP:GNG]].  I'm only able to translate one of the external links.  I'm unable to see the other one because of a &quot;timed out&quot; error in firefox, so I don't know what it says.  The other references I'm unable to find on-line or can't translate.  I've left an example of a pdf I can't translate at the AfD.  [[User:Bgwhite|Bgwhite]] ([[User talk:Bgwhite|talk]]) 21:18, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

Dear Shirt58

It is true that some text on the wiki article on ”Department of Physics and Astronomy” has been taken from the Departments official home page.
I am, however, Chairman of the Departments PR committee, and as such copyright holder of that text.
So there should be no problem…
Sorry to post this on your talk page. I also posted it on my talk page, but write it here to be sure you see it.

== Request regarding your WikiProject Astronomy template additions ==

Hello Shirt58,

I noticed that you have been adding the WikiProject Astronomy templates ''en masse'' to the various minor planet stub articles. If you continue to do this, would you mind terribly inserting &quot;|class=stub|importance=low&quot; into the template? Doing so would eliminate a lot of tedious drudgery for me, as these stub articles are not very significant from an astronomy perspective. (See [[:Category:Unassessed Astronomy articles of Unknown-importance]].) Very few minor planets have undergone sufficient study to rate them as higher than 'low', so those we can modify as needed.

Thank you! Regards, [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 18:01, 19 August 2011 (UTC)

== Hot Rod (rapper) ==

Thanks for notifying me about [[Talk:Hot Rod (rapper)]].  I've renominated the article for deletion procedurally, but I have insufficient knowledge myself in the field and so put myself down as a &quot;no opinion.&quot;  Please feel free to discuss your opinions.  --[[User:Nlu|Nlu]] ([[User talk:Nlu|talk]]) 15:24, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

== Iriscope page ==

Hi Pete
(I'm guessing this is the talk page you refer to. This is my first post inside Wikipedia, so I hope this is the way to communicate with you... )

I didn't think what i wrote had actually gone live (it wasn't actually finished)... i thought it stayed as a &quot;draft&quot; until i asked for it to be published.

'''In answer to your question''', yes i am Matthew D'haemer... and from a certain point of view a COI could be seen. However i have no intention of directly or even indirectly promoting my site (where i sell 'iriscopes' www.irislab.com and www.premalab.fr). I have not, nor will i attempt to hid the potential for COI. But i have a fare bit of experience and knowledge on the subject and thought that it could be shared here.
I understand the username advice... i thought that by not hiding my identity was better so that it was obvious i wasn't trying to pose as an invisible person (actually trying to not COI) but i see that this does like back to my site with a quick google search... i will change this.

'''My reason for wanting to write a wiki page''' on iriscopes, is because there is no such page. and in the field of natural health many people don't understand iriscopes very well. What i was trying to create was an informational page that explains what they are, the different types, the futur of iriscopes (as i'm sure in a few years, there will be 3D type camera around), maybe some info on the things to pay attention to when using a certain type of iriscope (eg. to minimise false positive diagnosis when using)  etc...
Iriscopes are very useful tools, when in the right hands... and giving people some of my experience will benefit the whole community of iridologists
There is no mention of my site, my products, nor will i hint at certain types being better than others... i'm actually hoping that what i write will be a seed, so that other people will make the page grow.

I'm a great believer in the principles wikipedia are based on, so I greatly welcome feedback and advice. My field of expertise is in the natural health field and i'm hoping to create more pages on other topics, and some of these could also be seen as a COI, so feedback is very helpful for a novice.

'''I propose that''' i finnish the page i was writing but keep it as a &quot;draft&quot; and when i'm done, i let you know, so you can check it, give feedback etc...  before release. If required lets invite a wiki person who also knows about iridology, iriscopes etc... to verify what i wrote is free of COI. 
Please tell me if this is ok before i make any changes

Thanks again for your questions/feedback

:I think i messed up this page, i though i was responding to Shirt58, but it seems i'm messing up other peoples posts... and i'm completly lost as to how to fix this mess... i'm very sorry about this... 
::All fixed, Matthew, don't worry about it. This is the right place to respond to Shirt58. You quite correctly added your new comment at the bottom, the only problem was that you didn't at first give it a header, then you added your header to replace the header of the short message just above yours. A simpler way to add a new message to a talk page is to click the &quot;New section&quot; tab at the top, which gets you a form for the message with a box for the header, and automatically puts it in the right place at the bottom of the page.

Yes, i would like to participate. It would be an honor! My English is still weak, but, i try to push myself. I am a former volleyball player and currently work as a journalist, in Brazil.

Good evening (or morning, depending on where you are), I see you are working on the footballer articles by {{user|Bad good dragosh98}} (at least a few of them), not sure if you noticed, but I summerized them in a list at the bottom of his talk page (easier to use than all the templated messages), if you needed a handy central access point for them.

== Hi ==
Hi [[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]]. Just to be clear, I haven't made any threat. You misunderstood. I told [[User:Bad good dragosh98|Bad good dragosh98]], that if he will vandalize Vaslui articles again, I will report him to the admins. I didn't said anything about me to block him, because I don't have this kind of power. Starting three or four weeks ago, an anonymous user, kept editing on Vaslui page, false information about the team. The media speculated many transfers, and this user edited them all as being sure transfers. This was for almost three weeks, when I just couldn't keep revert his edits anymore. So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page, and linked every sentence (because there was no reference before), and I applied for semi-protection for SC Vaslui page. After I got the page protected, there was no longer any false information, until [[User:Bad good dragosh98|Bad good dragosh98]] edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui (back then, he wasn't). I saw his contribs, and noticed that he is 13 years old, and is a big SC Vaslui fan, and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before. I don't think that's a coincidence. However, I noticed he has no current activity, so I think he either got my message, or he was blocked by admins. Either way, I'm more than happy. Hope you see this message, and reply me. Thanks!

I understand what you have done, but currently the main article is reinstated, untagged and still a copyright violation. Are you suggesting that I allow a period of grace before deleting as a cv again?

==Help needed for a student class project==
Please see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Classroom coordination/SFSU Class Project]] and consider adding your name. 

The scope of the Wikipedia:WikiProject Classroom coordination/SFSU Class Project is mainly concerned with new articles.

According to the [[User:Profhanley/teaching/literature of labor|teacher's instructions]], this group of students may not create a lot of new articles, but may instead focus more on improving existing articles. 

So, there may be little for us to do in the way the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject China/NNU Class Project]] required. The students may, however, still call on us for guidance in other areas. [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 09:15, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

Remember it is only a real rivalry when the competition is close; can’t say that for the NSW Blues, since they have never been even remotely close to the Maroons for a couple of years now. Haha!

I've heard a similar gourmet method for [[Squalius|chub]]. &quot;Gut the fish, spread it out flat and nail it to a board. Stand the board up in front of a fire for 30 minutes.

:For what it's worth I could probably [[WP:RS|source]] that.

== Vandalistic cockatoos in Tabasco Sauce ==

Thanks for your saucy comments on my question on Sci Ref Desk. There was no definitive answer to this question, so it might be up for grabs.

Btw, I looked up [[cork hat]] and was saddened to see that there was no piccie. This is so typical of WP Aussie articles, which are very much inferior to that devoted to most other first world countries. Also, a whole mob of metrosexual wankers on the talk page derided the concept as a shameful stereotype. Why? For anyone who has endured the plage proportions of a fly infestation in outback Oz, these devices were the epitome of practical and ingenious outback culture. They work, I have tried them.

Hello Shirt58! The [[WP:WMF|WMF]] is currently developing new tools to make new page patrolling much easier. Whether you  have patrolled many pages or only a few, we now need to  know about your experience.  The survey takes only 6 minutes, and the information you provide will not be shared with third parties other than to assist us in analyzing the results of the survey; the WMF will not use the information to identify you.
* If this invitation  also appears on other accounts you  may  have, please complete the  survey  once only.  
* If this has been sent to you in error and you have never patrolled new pages, please ignore it.
'''Please click [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/9RSKYC9 HERE] to take part.'''&lt;br&gt;
Many thanks in advance for providing this essential feedback.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 14:34, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

== Feedback Dashboard task force ==

Hi Shirt58,

Since you were a part of the [[WP:WikiGuides|WikiGuides]] project, I thought I'd give you a heads-up about a new way you can help/mentor newbies on en.wiki: we've recently released a feature called the [[:Special:FeedbackDashboard|Feedback Dashboard]], a queue that updates in real time with feedback and editing questions from new registered contributors who have attempted to make at least one edit. [[User:Steven (WMF)|Steven Walling]] and I are putting together a task force for experienced Wikipedians who might be interested in monitoring the queue and responding to the feedback: details are here at [[Wikipedia:Feedback Dashboard]]. Please sign up if you're interested in helping out! Thanks, [[User:Maryana (WMF)|Maryana (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Maryana (WMF)|talk]]) 22:08, 7 November 2011 (UTC)
:Ohhh! I had one of those messages and I can't even remember responding to anybody. I was half expecting to get a complaint about the summary, so thanks. Cheers. [[User:CambridgeBayWeather|CambridgeBayWeather]] ([[User talk:CambridgeBayWeather|talk]]) 06:29, 8 November 2011 (UTC)

== Da enlightened one ==

I've finally blocked (24 hours) {{user|Da enlightened one}}, specifically for copyright violations despite the warning I gave him, but his edits which change dates so they no longer reflect sources or the original articles (always making places look earlier), his ignoring requests to use edit summaries, and his general unwillingness to communicate despite my last post to his talk page contributed. If you have time, you might want to counsel him. Thanks. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 17:49, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

== A tool for you! ==

Hi {{BASEPAGENAME}}! I've just come across one of your edits (or that you have been patrolling new pages), and noticed that you might appreciate some help with references.

I case you're not aware, you might consider using [[WP:REFLINKS|this tool]] – it makes your life a whole heap easier, by filling in complete [[WP:CITET|citation templates]] for your links. All you do is install the script:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
// Add [[WP:Reflinks]] launcher in the toolbox on left
addOnloadHook(function () {
 addPortletLink(
  &quot;p-tb&quot;,     // toolbox portlet
  &quot;http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/webreflinks.py/&quot; + wgPageName 
   + &quot;?client=script&amp;citeweb=on&amp;overwrite=&amp;limit=30&amp;lang=&quot; + wgContentLanguage,
  &quot;Reflinks&quot;  // link label
)});
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
onto [[Special:MyPage/skin.js]], then paste the bare URL between your &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tabs, and you'll find a clickable link called Reflinks in your toolbox section of the page (probably in the left hand column). Then click that tool.  It does all the rest of the work (provided that you remember to save the page! It doesn't work for everything (particularly often not for PDF documents), but for pretty much anything ending in &quot;htm&quot; or &quot;html&quot; (and with a title) it will do really, really well. You may consider taking on [[:Category:Articles needing link rot cleanup]]. So long! --[[User:Sp33dyphil|Sp33dyphil]] ''[[User talk:Sp33dyphil|©]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sp33dyphil|©]]'' 08:56, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:File:Ego Leonard in Brighton 2008.jpg]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

A tag has been placed on [[:File:Ego Leonard in Brighton 2008.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#F3|section F3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an image licensed as &quot;for non-commercial use only,&quot; &quot;non-derivative use&quot; or &quot;used with permission,&quot; it has not been shown to comply with the limited standards for the use of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content]]. [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html], and it was either uploaded on or after 2005-05-19, or is not used in any articles. If you agree with the deletion, there is no need to do anything. If, however, you believe that this image may be retained on Wikipedia under one of the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|permitted conditions]] then:
* state clearly the source of the image. If it has been copied from elsewhere on the web you should provide links to: the image itself, the page which uses it and the page which contains the license conditions.
* add the relevant [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|copyright tag]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[File talk:Ego Leonard in Brighton 2008.jpg|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-noncom-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 12:13, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

== Speedy deletion declined: [[:Flair Finance]] ==
Hello Shirt58. I am just letting you know that I declined the speedy deletion of [[:Flair Finance]], a page you tagged for speedy deletion, because of the following concern: '''The previous AfD came to delete because there were no references whatsover. This article has some references, and therefor cannot be covered under the same AfD, and would have to run again.'''  Thank you.

Hi!
Concerning [[Diamond Cats]]...
[http://www.bravogirl.cz/news/2560-diamond-cats/cela-diskuze This] looks like a reliable news article to me. It's a website by [[Bauer Media Group]], the publisher of [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo magazine]].
Also, are you sure about italics? I've never seen italics used for band's names. [[Wikipedia:ITALICTITLE]] didn't help, it mentions only titles of bigger works and some specific cases. [[User:Moscowconnection|Moscowconnection]] ([[User talk:Moscowconnection|talk]]) 19:18, 1 December 2011 (UTC)

== Cocteau Twins ==

Hi, and thanks for your work there. I wondered if you could outline your specific OR issues with this article in article talk with a view to resolving them? Thanks a lot. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 13:19, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

:Hi John!

:As ''everyone'' knows, [[Cocteau Twins]] are without doubt the one of most sublimely sublime musical group that ever existed, and [[Heaven or Las Vegas]] is ''the'' defining musical masterwork of the 20th Century.  Erm... {{citation needed}}.

* &quot;[t]he Cocteau Twins tended to defy concise categorisation, and their music was a key influence on dream pop.&quot;
* &quot;The style the group had begun exploring with Head over Heels reached its peak on Heaven or Las Vegas... &quot;
*  &quot;The former consisted of four gentle acoustic songs,... &quot;
*  &quot;... and were close to breaking up over internal problems due in large part to Guthrie's addiction to drugs and alcohol... &quot; &lt;small&gt; [[WP:BLP]] problem?&lt;/small&gt;
* &quot;It was a departure from the heavily-processed, complex and layered sounds of Blue Bell Knoll and Heaven or Las Vegas, featuring clearer and more minimalistic arrangements... &quot;
:and so on.

:All the above is obviously [[WP:THETRUTH]], and just needs proper citations for verification.  Problem is, I think it will be rather dificult to find those refs... as they are quite possibly people's opinions.  Hence the tag.
--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58|talk]]) 13:51, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

::Thank you, that makes more sense now. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 14:01, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
:::To clarify, what I should have written was:
:::&lt;blockquote&gt;Problem is, I think it will be rather dificult to find those refs... as they are quite possibly &lt;s&gt;people's opinions&lt;/s&gt; the fact research and opinions of people who are ''not'' established music journalists writing in mainstream publications with close editorial oversight.  Hence the tag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:::--[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 14:11, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
*Guthrie's substance abuse issues are easy to find refs for as he has talked about them extensively. I have added a decent ref for that and trimmed out the worst of the fancruft. See what you think. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 14:19, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
** I see it, and I think - '''thank you very much indeed'''. --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 14:27, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
***Not at all, it was a pleasure. Thank you for highlighting the problems. I will take the tags down now if you have no objection. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 14:32, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

I have no reason to disbelieve the claims, which would make her at least as notable as the many college footballers who have articles. The main editor is clearly not a native English speaker, I'd give it the benefit of the doubt &lt;font face=&quot;chiller&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Jimfbleak| talk to me?]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:36, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

Hi shirt58,

I was leaving a message on the page of a new Wikipedia editor who started editing on January 27, 2012. This individual seems to have taken the barnstar you left on his/her page as an encouragement to delete as many articles in as short a time as possible from Wikipedia. I  am sure this was not your intent, but hope in future you will be a bit more selective in awarding barnstars.

This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be unambiguous advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item G11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, [[File:Speedy delete contest button.png|link={{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:GlacialTech}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}}]]. Clicking that button will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[{{TALKPAGENAME:GlacialTech}}|the article's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. You may freely add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Lighter104|Lighter104]] ([[User talk:Lighter104|talk]]) 03:54, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

== Sport in India: Archery ==

Hi. Regarding {{diff|Sport in India|490750427|490742578|your blanking}} of [[Sport in India#Archery]], I think that the source cited is actually a {{tl|Backwardscopy}}. Assuming that the date in the URL is accurate, http://indiansports.ind.in/2011/06/30/archery-in-india/, the Wikipedia section predates it, being present {{oldid|Sport in India|405020940#Archery|as of December 2010}}. I have not tracked down the exact point of insertion or confirmed that the WP text is original, so it might be a copyvio from somewhere else. In light of what looks like rampant copying in all directions, I think that we need to track down the content's origin as precisely as possible, using specific revisions and the [[Internet Archive]].

== Sport in India: Archery ==

Hi. Regarding {{diff|Sport in India|490750427|490742578|your blanking}} of [[Sport in India#Archery]], I think that the source cited is actually a {{tl|Backwardscopy}}. Assuming that the date in the URL is accurate, http://indiansports.ind.in/2011/06/30/archery-in-india/, the Wikipedia section predates it, being present {{oldid|Sport in India|405020940#Archery|as of December 2010}}. I have not tracked down the exact point of insertion or confirmed that the WP text is original, so it might be a copyvio from somewhere else. In light of what looks like rampant copying in all directions, I think that we need to track down the content's origin as precisely as possible, using specific revisions and the [[Internet Archive]].

==Disambiguation link notification for April 30==

Hi. When you recently edited [[Adalberto Tejeda Olivares]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Mexican]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Adalberto_Tejeda_Olivares|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Adalberto_Tejeda_Olivares|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

== Sport in India: Archery ==

Hi. Regarding {{diff|Sport in India|490750427|490742578|your blanking}} of [[Sport in India#Archery]], I think that the source cited is actually a {{tl|Backwardscopy}}. Assuming that the date in the URL is accurate, http://indiansports.ind.in/2011/06/30/archery-in-india/, the Wikipedia section predates it, being present {{oldid|Sport in India|405020940#Archery|as of December 2010}}. I have not tracked down the exact point of insertion or confirmed that the WP text is original, so it might be a copyvio from somewhere else. In light of what looks like rampant copying in all directions, I think that we need to track down the content's origin as precisely as possible, using specific revisions and the [[Internet Archive]].

== NNU wrap-up time is May 30 ==

Hello. There are still some articles at [[Wikipedia:School and university projects/NNU Class Project/Winter 2012/Student list]] that need moving to the mainspace. Some have rubbish references and could be AfDd, so best not move those. But many just need a bit of cleanup and a move. If you have time to do a few, we would be much obliged.

Thanks for your email. A quick Google search provided numerous reliable sources. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 13:22, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

== Dowlyn Daly unreliable references ==

Hi Shirt 58. I noticed you recently added tags to the [[Dowlyn Daly]] article suggesting more references were needed and that the existing references were unreliable. I just wanted an explanation for this, as the four references (admittedly few, but to be fair this is a stub about a British Virgin Islands footballer - not a lot of information about him on the web) all come from websites dedicated to football. Soccerway is well-respected for player and game information, and the official British Virgin Islands Football Association website is hardly an unreliable source. Footballzz is less reliable than the others, but even so, I still think it's good enough.

I think even if you were really critical only one of the references could be considered unreliable and as for the &quot;More references needed&quot; tag, I'd agree more but given the short nature of the article, there's not much information in the article that isn't referenced.

I look forward to your response. 

Thanks,

==Adding peacock tag==
Hi Shirt58,

I noticed that you added a peacock tag to the page that I just wrote. In the spirit of helping me improve the article, can you please specify where you see &quot; wording that merely promotes the subject without imparting verifiable information.&quot; As far as I can tell, all information is properly cited using verifiable sources. The article or better stub I used as a role model was this one here:

A tag has been placed on [[:File:Penguin 2005 SueTownsend AdrianMoleandtheWeaponsofMassDestruction frontcover.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#F1|section F1 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the image is an unused redundant copy (all pixels the same or scaled down) of an image in the same file format, which is on Wikipedia (not on Commons), and all inward links have been updated. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[File talk:Penguin 2005 SueTownsend AdrianMoleandtheWeaponsofMassDestruction frontcover.jpg|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]].  &lt;!-- Template:Db-redundantimage-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 13:05, 26 September 2012 (UTC)

Hi Shirt, thanks for the feedback. I'm new to Wikipedia and was trying to add an entry for my Company to follow on what our Parent company has and our Sister company to make Wikipedia more factual. To my knowledge there are no copyright issues and the article is factually correct. I have ensured that the article is not a marketing piece. Please advise if and what I would need to do next.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

==Disambiguation link notification for September 14==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Richa Panai]], you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages [[Mollywood]] and [[Tollywood]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Richa_Panai|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Richa_Panai|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

== RE: About [[Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board (TAAB)]] ==
Hi Shirt58 - Thanks for leaving the post on my talk page - forgive me if I'm not meant to respond here, I'm still learning the ropes and proper etiquette on Wikipedia.
I see a bit of a problem with the content I have for the [[Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board (TAAB)]] page - a friend and University of Tasmana student put together a research paper on the TAAB and asked me to upload it to Wikipedia, a copy also went to Arts Tasmania which was then uploaded to their website. 
We now want it to be on Wikipedia so the greater public can contribute to the information but we keep being warned because it's 'copyvio' (which I don't yet understand completely - just because parts of the same content is elsewhere on the Internet doesn't garentee that it will always be there, they could remove or change it without warning. I would have thought it is fine as long as it is not a peice for peice copy and paste and we own the copyright on the content?)
Should we ask Arts Tasmania to remove it from their website so it can once again be put on Wikipedia?
Any advice on how to proceed would be appriciated.

Hey there! I'm really failing to understand why users keep rendering her given name &quot;아름&quot; as &quot;雅凜&quot;. &quot;아름&quot; is a Native Korean word and is not a Sino-Korean word of Chinese origin, therefore, it is only ever written exclusively in Hangul. Hanja does NOT equal Chinese, it is the implementation of Chinese characters for writing the Korean language. If you don't want to take my word for it, you can have a look at an online dictionary where it explicitly shows that 아름 does not have any corresponding Hanja as it is a native Korean word.

As you know, I am new to Wikepedia - as a contributor/editor that is - so am not sure if I am right to respond to you on your talk page or on mine. It seems to make sense to me to keep the thread of any discussion on one page so should that be yours or mine - or even off Wikepedia altogether?
I can provide some links to UK newspaper articles on Home Office circular 46/2004 and its effect on the administration of injury pensions granted to disabled former police officers.

Thanks for the link, Shirt58. I think it's clear that Nolan chose horizontal stripes (&quot;rugby hoops&quot;) to stand out in contrast to the vertical lines of the goalpost and boundary fence. Pretty smart composition.

Hello, I noticed that you recently created a new page, '''[[:Johor Bahru General Hospital]]'''. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - '''[[:Hospital Sultanah Aminah]]'''. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for [[WP:A10|speedy deletion]]. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at [[:Hospital Sultanah Aminah]] - you might like to discuss new information at [[Talk:Hospital Sultanah Aminah|the article's talk page]]. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Johor Bahru General Hospital|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the [[WP:AFC|article creation process]] and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

A tag has been placed on [[:User talk:Petclub24]], requesting that it be deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under two or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], by which articles can be deleted at any time, without discussion. If the page meets any of these strictly-defined criteria, then it may be soon be deleted by an administrator. The reasons it has been tagged are:
* It seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. (See [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information.
*It appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. (See [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. &lt;p&gt;If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. However, even if you use one of these processes to release copyrighted material to Wikipedia, it still needs to comply with the other [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] to be eligible for inclusion. If you would like any assistance with this, you can ask a question at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]].&lt;/p&gt; 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag.

== Invitation to become registered editor ==

Hi Shirt58,

You today invited me at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science to create an account for myself.  You have done this for at least one other person who has posted to Ref Desk under an IP address.

Thank you for your good intentions, but please be aware that this is pointless and just fills up Wikipedia servers with orphan talk pages, because IP addresses are reassign by ISP's alll the time to diffrent users.  The IP address I have now could be someone else's only a few minutes later.  It's only a fluke that I spotted your effort.  If you want to discuss anythging with an unregistered user, invite them to your talk page.

There are good reasons for not registering, mostly centred around the strange attitudes of Wikipedia administrators.  If you look at the administrator's talk page archive, you will see a a number of discussions, some quite lengthy and bordering on the vitriolic, with various unregistered and registered posters on this topic.  Like others, I have posted to Ref Desk in good faith, and always constructive.  Never the less, some admins and some editors don't like me, and have tried to block and ban me.  Registering would only make it easier for them.  I have in recent months sharply reduced my contributions to Ref Desk due to the attitudes of certain Wikipedians who appear to view it as a club to which new members are not necessarily welcome.

Hey {{BASEPAGENAME}}. I'm dropping you a note because you used to (or still do!) patrol new pages. This is just to let you know that we've deployed and developed [[Special:NewPagesFeed|Page Curation]], which augments and supersedes Special:NewPages - there are a lot of interesting new features :). There's some help documentation [[Wikipedia:Page Curation/Introduction|here]] if you want to familiarise yourself with the system and start using it.

In regard to this article, if the subject is a member of the Saudi royal family, where is the article about his father?

:I don't think being a member of the Saudi Royal family is enough: there are thousands of them, literally - see [[House of Saud]]. I have looked twice at that article and not decided either to delete or to de-speedy, but I don't think it would survive AfD. Seems to be an autobiography.

== Brisbane Lions ==

I wasn't sure how to reply to your message, so this is my attempt. I was wanting to update the Brisbane Lions Membership and Average Attendance chart (in the Membership base and sponsorship section) to include the 2012 figures, which I have now completed. The previous owner had not updated the chart since 2008, so I had updated it with the 2009-2011 figures earlier in the year. I have also just finished adding an Average Goals per Game chart to Jonathon Brown's page.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brisbane1965|Brisbane1965]] ([[User talk:Brisbane1965|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brisbane1965|contribs]]) 13:55, 3 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Sporting Clube de Goa squad ==

Hey mate. First off I would like to thank you for taking the time to edit on the [[Sporting Clube de Goa]] page and add the appropriate tags to certain articles but I just noticed you created the Sporting Clube de Goa squad template which is fine because I was going to get to that eventually but I saw you based this off the squad on the club website but that is not exactly  correct. That squad has not been updated since around 2 years ago (which is strange because they update the articles in the site) but for example, KAILO KARPEH, is listed on the club website but he was released over the summer and Warun Deep (or [[Warundeep Singh]]) left the club in 2011. Milagrio Medeira played for [[Vasco S.C.]] since 2011 as well as proven through here ([http://www.goal.com/en-india/people/aruba/25102/milagrio-medeira]). Not saying what you did was wrong (most of the squad is still there) but I thought I would tell you that I will redo the template before I actually do it. Cheers and again thank you for the help. --[[User:Arsenalkid700|Arsenalkid700]] ([[User talk:Arsenalkid700|talk]]) 04:24, 14 October 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks mate. The template is good, however it would only really work if I knew the numbers of each player. A football template needs the numbers the players wear on the back of there jerseys which we dont know for Sporting. There are clubs that I still need to do which this template will come in handy for and it shall make my life easier. As for the source... well the site does not update so I used to recent edition of the Indian Football 2012-13 transfer list (Seen here [http://www.sportskeeda.com/2012/10/06/indian-football-transfer-season-201213-version-4/]) and so far, based on the two games Sporting has played this season, that list is right. --[[User:Arsenalkid700|Arsenalkid700]] ([[User talk:Arsenalkid700|talk]]) 05:03, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

Usually during the week I never edit wikipedia due to school but on weekends I like to stay up till around 3 in the morning; however that is only because I am redoing all the Indian footy pages.

==Lutefisk==
Stockfish is pre-lutefisk — the hard, dried stage. By the time it's been processed into actual lutefisk it's of a rather jelly-like texture. Throwing a handful of it at an editor to teach them a lesson might have a nice slopping effect, if your aim is good, but whacking with it I should think literally impossible. Besides, what's good about the stockfish is that the ''rack'' enters into the walloping! [''Proudly'' :] Effective, I should think! They'll remember ''that'' for a few weeks! Did little Shirt notice [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darwinbish&amp;diff=517566319&amp;oldid=515377140 my recent generous offer] to consider requests for specialised teaching-a-lesson templates? [''Dubiously'' :] I suppose I could ''try'' to design a lutefisk-throwing template. I don't know if I feel really inspired, though. The thrower would need a serious shower, or steam-bath, too. (P. S. Always substitute my templates &lt;s&gt;if&lt;/s&gt; when you use them, to get your own sender name in them.)

== User:Dugararchit ==

I thought that was a very forebearing remark you left on this talk page. Forgive me if I am attempting to teach my grandmother how to suck eggs, but if you look at the edit histories of the various pages edit by this person, there appears to be at best some tag-team editing going on &amp; I suspect a sock IP edit on one of the talk pages. I'm not really experienced enough in the wikiworld to know whether it is is worth taking further or how to do it. [[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 08:25, 19 October 2012 (UTC)
:Hi again, TheLongTone, and thanks for your kind message. 
:My personal editing philosophy includes trying to reduce the amount of unnecessary on-wiki drama. In this case, I thought I'd also let the editor know that [[singular they|their]] edits may also cause unnecessary ''off-wiki'' drama.  That is because I am the nicest person in the entire world.{{dubious|date=October 2012}}
:And no, no-one's [[Teaching grandmother to suck eggs|granny needs lessons]] here. I've been here a long while, and often ask other editors for help with what might seem to them klewless moob questions; for example, I'm still hopelessly naive about most of the techy workings of the software.
:As for the &lt;small&gt;&lt;lawyer&gt;&lt;/small&gt; alleged allegations of allegations of alleged sockpuppetry allegations &lt;small&gt;&lt;/lawyer&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, do you have [[WP:TWINKLE]] switched on in your userprefs?  It will guide you through the process of adding a [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations]] case.  Let me know if you have any questions about this, or anything else.

::And I thought that I was the nicest person in all the world.

==Thanks for the contact==

Hi there, thanks for your observations on my editing. Just to let you know while I do have an association to [[The Academy of Music and Sound]] my intention is to bring this page into line with the guidelines suggested at the top of the page. This is also my first time editing a page so I am feeling my way through the process.
I can assure you that I hold the integrity of wikipedia at heart as a long time user and do not wish to use this as an advertising platform. I believe the Academy is genuinely noteworthy and would welcome any and all suggestions in helping me bring this article into line.

== Regarding GrexIt:  non-notability tag ==

Hello,

I noticed that you have tagged a software company's article created by me (GrexIt (software)). I think this company has many firms (mainly in Europe) as it's customer and I personally use it and find it very useful for conversations and tracking of the same. Company's customer page (http://grexit.com/grexit-customers) and the notes I cited in the wiki page of GrexIt looks satisfactory to me. I had started using it after reading these articles only and I found/thought of sites like TechCrunch credible enough, before starting to use. Please let me know of you still have questions.

== Deletion request for [[Template:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]] ==

As you rightly said, &quot;Technically, the WP:R2 tag is incorrect.&quot; Even so, tagging it for that criterion was reasonable, in the hope that some admin would [[WP:IAR|ignore all rules]] and delete it anyway. However, I can suggest two alternative possibilities that might have been better. {{tl|db-g6}} (Uncontroversial maintenance or clean-up) would cover it. Also, for almost any page that you have created and nobody else has edited, {{tl|db-g7}} (one author of the page, who has requested deletion) is pretty well certain to be accepted.

== Butts Bridge ==

When {{tl|coord}} is used with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{coord|number|number|number|N|number|number|number|W}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the numbers represent degrees, minutes, and seconds respectively.  The only problem with your edit to the Connecticut NRHP bridges list is that you put in slightly wrong numbers — the latitude had 65 minutes and the longitude 97 minutes, and the template objected because latitudes and longitudes by definition can't have more than 59 minutes.  For future reference — another way to get the coords is to look at the NRHP county list; all NRHP sites are on a county-level (or sub-county level) list, and these almost always include the coords.  For the Butts Bridge, you want [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Windham County, Connecticut]].  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 20:40, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

I wouldn't ask anyone to be a &quot;[[Sycophancy|yes man]]&quot; for me, but I could definitely use some real support, even if that means telling me that I have been wrong in [[Wikipedia:ANI#Statement_of_intent_to_go_against_consensus.2C_followed_by_that_action|this debate]]. -- [[User:Beleg Strongbow|Beleg Strongbow]] ([[User talk:Beleg Strongbow|talk]]) 16:36, 7 November 2012 (UTC)

Thanks. I have to admit I feel like not following it up, but the band is important, they've won awards at the Edinburgh Festival and as you know there are quite a few interviews/articles. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 02:14, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

== Speedy deletion nomination of Åge Vedel Tåning ==

Hello Shirt58,

I wanted to let you know that I just tagged [[Åge Vedel Tåning]] for deletion, because the article doesn't clearly say why the subject is important enough to be included in an encyclopedia.

If you feel that the article shouldn't be deleted and want more time to work on it, you can &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title={{urlencode:Talk:Åge Vedel Tåning}}&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+page+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+ contest this deletion]'''&lt;/span&gt;, but please don't remove the speedy deletion tag from the top.

You can leave a note on [[User_talk:Mrt3366|my talk page]] if you have questions. Thanks, [[User:Mrt3366|&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;Mr&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;T&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Mrt3366|&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Talk?)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:User_talk:Mrt3366|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=User_talk:Mrt3366/new_section}} &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(New thread?)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 12:01, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

===status===
 
As reviewing administrator,  I need to apologize on behalf of Wikipedia. The   deletion tag above was added by an inexperienced   editor, who needs to learn a good deal more before doing speedy patrolling. At the English WP, in order to satisfy the relevant speedy criterion for importance of people, [[WP:CSD#A7]], it is not necessary to be notable, or even probably notable ; it is only necessary to have some indication of plausible importance. This is a very low bar, and deliberately so.  But he in particular would clearly and unquestionably meet our criteria for [[WP:PROF]] because of his directorship, and also [[WP:GNG]] because of the 3 obits (I added the ones from the French WP). You mention in your message to Mr.T some conflicts about this at the da and fr WPs. I see none on the article history or on its talk p.  I work a good deal  here   in articles on academics, so I'd be very interested in knowing something about it. Please respond on my talk page, for otherwise I might not see it.

Hi Pete, thanks for that, deleted as spam (the previous deletion was pretty much the same text). It's the third deletion, but I won't salt yet because the first was nearly two years ago. 

I don't normally have any involvement in RFA, and I don't watch that page, but I'd be happy to support any nomination, you'll just need to let me know &lt;font face=&quot;chiller&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Jimfbleak| talk to me?]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:43, 21 November 2012 (UTC)

I agree that he is notable, you would think that a paid editor would make a better fist of writing an acceptable article, I'd ask for my money back (: &lt;font face=&quot;chiller&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Jimfbleak| talk to me?]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:55, 21 November 2012 (UTC)

I had a conflict in italian wikipedia and some italian admins consider me a vandal but it's not so. 
So I ask u if you can help me to restore my olds accoounts (kurt4 or francesds).
Hope we can discuss calmy and adopting a NPOV.

Vituzzu has had a conflict with me in italian wikipedia. he accused me to use false sources but I demonstrated I had reason. I had edited an article concerning an italian professor (it's not my former professor and i'm not a student), there were no vandalism or diffamation but he had done some pressions on wiki.it admins cause he diden't like some of my edits. Two preminent other italian professors has confirmed my version and writed to it.wikipedia for protesting. There is a discussion in progress. I hope we can discuss calmy and I can work without problems. You can read italian and you can verify the quality of texts in my sandbox. Furthermore vituzzu has vandalised many times my sandbox.

I don't think he burying the hachet appears to be in the cards...a few hours ago, he accused me and another editor of being meatpuppets.  Recently, he appeared to stand by that assertion at ANI.  Also, it's worth noting that while he tried to boot me from his talk page back in January, at the exact same time he was posting comments to my talk page (See [[User talk:Purplebackpack89/Archive 7]] and my talk page history) &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid;background:#800080&quot;&gt;[[User:Purplebackpack89|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FFCC00&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Purplebackpack89|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FFCC00;&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;]][[User:Purplebackpack89/C|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FFCC00;&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:06, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

== How about taking it up another notch ==

Let me cut to the chase straightaway, I like your amicable attitude, and admire the spread of your contributions more importantly (not talking about edit count, don't think it measures anything other than activity frankly). You seem to have a good grasp of [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|how things work in here]]. In short you are a reliable editor here. Hence, would you like me to nominate you for adminship? I don't really like this nominating for adminship business. I have generally avoided RfAs but nevertheless commented in some RfAs too. It's my belief that Wikipedia needs more admins with fair attitude like you. So, if you decide something let me know. Cheers, [[User:Mrt3366|&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;Mr&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;T&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Mrt3366|&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Talk?)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:User_talk:Mrt3366|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=User_talk:Mrt3366/new_section}} &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(New thread?)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 15:35, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
:I take that comment as an affirmative. I went ahead and asked [[User_talk:Worm_That_Turned#Hello.21|Wormm on his talk page]] as I don't wish to take any chances.

[[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Shirt58]] - this page has been created.
You need to ''indicate the acceptance of the nomination'' (once you do that, ask Worm to transclude the request or I might do something). Then answer these basic questions there:

# ''What administrative work do you intend to take part in? ''
# ''What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why? ''
# ''Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?''

Hope you reply soon.

:Shirt58, take your time, don't rush. If you'd rather postpone, we can wait - its better that you are happy with everything. MrT, stop being so pushy. These things take time, I'm sure Shirt58 is capable of reading the page just as I hope he's read the advice for administrator candidates. RfA is something that one needs to prepare for as a silly answer or an incorrect one can gain you many opposes very quickly. It's an open book exam where how you handle criticism is one of the factors, so you are likely to be criticised. As long as he stays calm I'm sure he will be fine but don't rush him, however excited you may be.

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[David Buss (United States Navy)]], you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages [[Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[Distinguished Service Medal]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/David_Buss_%28United_States_Navy%29|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/David_Buss_%28United_States_Navy%29|fix with Dab solver]]).

== About Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) and WP:COPYVIO problems ==

Hi there, thanks so much fr sharing your concerns, I totally understood the copy material concerns &amp; ll keep it in view in future  however, I had a doubt on the first point of the text that you have mentioned- 

Text: &quot;Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI)is the apex body of fashion design in India&quot;
Source: &quot;THE Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI), the apex body of Indian designers&quot;

I was quite skeptical to use the term &quot;apex body&quot; (as mentioned on their official web) thinking that it can come under the category of flowery language so I particularly searched for a neutral source to confirm it. Hence, I did not change the sentence. Although I noticed that the article has already been edited, it would help me if you could clarify the doubt.

cheers :)  [[User:Callousfreak|Callousfreak]] ([[User talk:Callousfreak|talk]]) 16:30, 17 December 2012 (UTC)

== Help required in merging  ==

hey, as m quite new here I was wondering whether you could help me in sorting out this mess I myself created.
There is this article [[J J Vallaya]] that I created however later discovered that wikipedia already has a dedicated page for this which spells like [[JJ Valaya]]. I have put in this template for merging the 2 articles. Can you please check this whether its being done in the right way??? I hope you ll be happy to help :) [[User:Callousfreak|Callousfreak]] ([[User talk:Callousfreak|talk]]) 16:39, 17 December 2012 (UTC)
* Why do you need help? It was probably not necessary to delete your text at [[J J Vallaya]] but I have e-mailed you it.

==== Social History Tea Article ====

Hello Peter. Thanks for your feedback. Just one point - the section you refer to as being copyrighted - is duly credited in the citations and has been put in quotes - as it only has numbers related to tea production. This is purely factual information - hence one deemed the use of quote marks as appropriate. Would you still say it is copyright violation ? Look forward to your feedback.
Thanks and a Happy New Year.

Hi,

Thank you for your email. I have set the page up as she is quite big in australia at the moment. I read an article in the paper (which was not published online) about the fact that she is very media shy and doesn't actually do a lot of articles or publicity. Because she is quite well known in Australia i believe that she (Arlene Zelina) is worthy of a wikipedia page and I see I am not the only one there is another user on the page who also thinks that. 

She is set to release her first single with the record label this year and I am sure there will be some press around that but I dont believe it should be deleted just because you dont live in australia and havent seen her on the news here like we all have.

I know that as Arlene has received coverage from the star. I still don't think it is fair to delete an article on someone who does have more coverage than quite a few of the approved articles on here. Where is the fairness in that? At least she has global coverage with radio stations writing on their websites from Boston, NYC etc. where is the credibility of half the articles on people that have been approved with no verification!?!?!  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ckenn18|Ckenn18]] ([[User talk:Ckenn18|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ckenn18|contribs]]) 02:14, 6 January 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Disambiguation link notification for February 3==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Nanto Rikushū]], you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages [[Indian]] and [[Nara]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Nanto_Rikush%C5%AB|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Nanto_Rikush%C5%AB|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

Thanks for reviewing [[New islamic Revolution]], Shirt58. 

Unfortunately [[User:MrX|MrX]] has just gone over this page again and unreviewed it. Their note is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm unreviewing this article so it gets a little more attention from other editors. It seems as it may be a copy paste from a book, and thus a copyvio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hungarians put the family name first, so when they romanize Japanese names they preserve the family name first convention.

==If==
You want a 2,000 word tirade on why every pastoral lease / station in western australia is notable, ask me, I started the 'List of pastoral leases...', and over the dead body of a good mate who used to be on the pastoral lands board who fed me some very interesting information, I could provide at least a 4 page article (give me time though) on the reasons why stations/pastoral leases - each - are significant and notable in  western australian history, ecology and a few other things as well... [[User:SatuSuro|sats]] 01:11, 24 February 2013 (UTC)
::If you find my reaction in anyway a problem - it is meant ''[[WP:AGF]]'' - in the n icest way - I happen to think the issue of pastoral leases/stations is a hell of a lot more complicated than your lead into the AFD - and have spent quite a few years talking to people who understand the ecological land management issues in rangelands, as well as historians of pastoral leases - and dont like seeing the subject given such short shrift...  Also I have a few favourite stations that I have every intention of writing articles about as they are complex sites with many significances across a number of subjects.  So if you are in the slightest put out - feel welcome to go off wiki and send me an email and I can give you even more reasons - whichj I will not do so here on wiki.. cheers - and dont forget to expand the inquirer one liner!! [[User:SatuSuro|sats]] 02:02, 24 February 2013 (UTC)
::: First things first. Thanks for replying. Also the agf reply.  I do not think that the Afd reflects badly on you in any way whatsoever - it is a conversation well worth having - there is simply not the back up info structured into the western australian project that I can give a quick and easy reply... in retrospect (driving around being dads taxi to one of mine...) it might take 6 months of a range of edits to make a case or looking at them all as unique and important and notable... so in my rush to make claims above - I might not be able to return to the argument with adequate info for that sort of time...  so maybe I was a slight rushed in my response. In that case my apologies... Have fun, speak to you soon [[User:SatuSuro|sats]] 05:00, 24 February 2013 (UTC)

==About [[Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences]]==
Hi Pete

Thanks for your welcoming message. I have been editing the page of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. I have openly declared on my talk page that I work for the university to keep things very transparent. I have edited the page looking at what other business schools with Wikipedia pages have written and done, and I have kept the page without advertising.

However, the page have a lot of warnings at the top. What can I do to improve this. The page is about a university business school and is not an ad.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

I have zapped it as a copyvio, and added some advice to [[User talk:Anwarul Haq LASOONA]] which I have found necessary in cases like this to avoid the situation where people go through the hassle of OTRS only to have the text deleted anyway as hopelessly promotional.

From looking at your contributions, you edited the description page for this photo of the ship from Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N., which was uploaded by another user under a claim of fair use. It is used in two articles. Do you believe that both of these uses are correct and in keeping with our policy? Why or why not? --B (talk) 14:08, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

As you most likely know, administrators are not permitted to block users with whom they are &quot;involved&quot;. What does &quot;involved&quot; mean to you? Consider this scenario: You block a user for 3RR based on a report at AN3. He immediately contests the block on the grounds that you are an &quot;involved&quot; editor, pointing to a debate from some time ago in which the two of you held opposite views. (You had forgotten about the debate and did not make the connection until he pointed it out.) What would you do? --B (talk) 14:08, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

You are evaluating an articles for deletion discussion for a BLP. It is known that the subject of the article desires for the article to be deleted. How much does that weigh into your decision? --B (talk) 14:08, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

== Questions at RfA ==

Hi Shirt. :) I see that one editor has switched from support to oppose because you haven't answered the optional questions yet. Are you planning on answering them? It's up to you if you want to answer them or not, of course, but you should be aware that editors will factor that into their decision to support or oppose. Best — '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif&quot;&gt;Mr. Stradivarius&lt;/span&gt;]]''''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|♪ talk ♪]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:50, 8 March 2013 (UTC)

::Not to pile it on, but I'm puzzled by the same thing. I almost didn't cast my support vote because of it but figured you were just being a bit slow. Answers at an RfA are very important. With the exception of some really off-the-wall question from a troll (which these are not), you should always answer them reasonably promptly, or at least post a note as to why it's taking you so long. And some candidates even answer troll-like questions. Anyway, without prying, I hope everything is okay.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 14:50, 8 March 2013 (UTC)

Hey there! I'm really failing to understand why users keep rendering her given name &quot;아름&quot; as &quot;雅凜&quot;. &quot;아름&quot; is a Native Korean word and is not a Sino-Korean word of Chinese origin, therefore, it is only ever written exclusively in Hangul. Hanja does NOT equal Chinese, it is the implementation of Chinese characters for writing the Korean language. If you don't want to take my word for it, you can have a look at an online dictionary where it explicitly shows that 아름 does not have any corresponding Hanja as it is a native Korean word.

&lt;strike&gt;:I've left a note responding to the rather belligerent message the user above left on my talkpage; he is profoundly mistaken about the community's patience for characterization of opposition to nationalist POV warring as &quot;vandalism.&quot; '''&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;[[User:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Acroterion&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''' 21:23, 18 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;

Your response was flawed nonsense once again, Acroterion. It is quite clear that I am not mistaken at all - this, as the case before, is NOT just opposition but clearly vandalism. Not only that, but his vandalism is not opposition against such things - it IS nationalist POV edit warring.

Hello, I noticed that you recently created a new page, '''[[:Johor Bahru General Hospital]]'''. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you.

If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at [[:Hospital Sultanah Aminah]] - you might like to discuss new information at [[Talk:Hospital Sultanah Aminah|the article's talk page]]. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Johor Bahru General Hospital|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay.

A tag has been placed on [[:User talk:Petclub24]], requesting that it be deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under two or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], by which articles can be deleted at any time, without discussion. If the page meets any of these strictly-defined criteria, then it may be soon be deleted by an administrator. The reasons it has been tagged are:
* It seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. (See [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information.
*It appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. (See [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. &lt;p&gt;If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. However, even if you use one of these processes to release copyrighted material to Wikipedia, it still needs to comply with the other [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] to be eligible for inclusion. If you would like any assistance with this, you can ask a question at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]].&lt;/p&gt;

== Invitation to become registered editor ==

Hi Shirt58,

You today invited me at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science to create an account for myself.  You have done this for at least one other person who has posted to Ref Desk under an IP address.

Thank you for your good intentions, but please be aware that this is pointless and just fills up Wikipedia servers with orphan talk pages, because IP addresses are reassign by ISP's alll the time to diffrent users.  The IP address I have now could be someone else's only a few minutes later.  It's only a fluke that I spotted your effort.  If you want to discuss anythging with an unregistered user, invite them to your talk page.

There are good reasons for not registering, mostly centred around the strange attitudes of Wikipedia administrators.  If you look at the administrator's talk page archive, you will see a a number of discussions, some quite lengthy and bordering on the vitriolic, with various unregistered and registered posters on this topic.  Like others, I have posted to Ref Desk in good faith, and always constructive.  Never the less, some admins and some editors don't like me, and have tried to block and ban me.  Registering would only make it easier for them.  I have in recent months sharply reduced my contributions to Ref Desk due to the attitudes of certain Wikipedians who appear to view it as a club to which new members are not necessarily welcome.

== Brisbane Lions ==

I wasn't sure how to reply to your message, so this is my attempt. I was wanting to update the Brisbane Lions Membership and Average Attendance chart (in the Membership base and sponsorship section) to include the 2012 figures, which I have now completed. The previous owner had not updated the chart since 2008, so I had updated it with the 2009-2011 figures earlier in the year. I have also just finished adding an Average Goals per Game chart to Jonathon Brown's page.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brisbane1965|Brisbane1965]] ([[User talk:Brisbane1965|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brisbane1965|contribs]]) 13:55, 3 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Sporting Clube de Goa squad ==

Hey mate. First off I would like to thank you for taking the time to edit on the [[Sporting Clube de Goa]] page and add the appropriate tags to certain articles but I just noticed you created the Sporting Clube de Goa squad template which is fine because I was going to get to that eventually but I saw you based this off the squad on the club website but that is not exactly  correct. That squad has not been updated since around 2 years ago (which is strange because they update the articles in the site) but for example, KAILO KARPEH, is listed on the club website but he was released over the summer and Warun Deep (or [[Warundeep Singh]]) left the club in 2011. Milagrio Medeira played for [[Vasco S.C.]] since 2011 as well as proven through here ([http://www.goal.com/en-india/people/aruba/25102/milagrio-medeira]). Not saying what you did was wrong (most of the squad is still there) but I thought I would tell you that I will redo the template before I actually do it. Cheers and again thank you for the help. --[[User:Arsenalkid700|Arsenalkid700]] ([[User talk:Arsenalkid700|talk]]) 04:24, 14 October 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks mate. The template is good, however it would only really work if I knew the numbers of each player. A football template needs the numbers the players wear on the back of there jerseys which we dont know for Sporting. There are clubs that I still need to do which this template will come in handy for and it shall make my life easier. As for the source... well the site does not update so I used to recent edition of the Indian Football 2012-13 transfer list (Seen here [http://www.sportskeeda.com/2012/10/06/indian-football-transfer-season-201213-version-4/]) and so far, based on the two games Sporting has played this season, that list is right. --[[User:Arsenalkid700|Arsenalkid700]] ([[User talk:Arsenalkid700|talk]]) 05:03, 14 October 2012 (UTC)
::Ah, your in Australia. You should be watching the A-League... Melbourne Heart vs. Wellington Phoenix is a good game at the moment haha. But ya, I am in the Eastern Standard Time Zone... American EST. So it is currently 1:19 in the morning. Usually during the week I never edit wikipedia due to school but on weekends I like to stay up till around 3 in the morning; however that is only because I am redoing all the Indian footy pages.

==Lutefisk==
Stockfish is pre-lutefisk — the hard, dried stage. By the time it's been processed into actual lutefisk it's of a rather jelly-like texture. Throwing a handful of it at an editor to teach them a lesson might have a nice slopping effect, if your aim is good, but whacking with it I should think literally impossible. Besides, what's good about the stockfish is that the ''rack'' enters into the walloping! [''Proudly'' :] Effective, I should think! They'll remember ''that'' for a few weeks! Did little Shirt notice [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darwinbish&amp;diff=517566319&amp;oldid=515377140 my recent generous offer] to consider requests for specialised teaching-a-lesson templates? [''Dubiously'' :] I suppose I could ''try'' to design a lutefisk-throwing template. I don't know if I feel really inspired, though. The thrower would need a serious shower, or steam-bath, too. (P. S. Always substitute my templates &lt;s&gt;if&lt;/s&gt; when you use them, to get your own sender name in them.)

== User:Dugararchit ==

I thought that was a very forebearing remark you left on this talk page. Forgive me if I am attempting to teach my grandmother how to suck eggs, but if you look at the edit histories of the various pages edit by this person, there appears to be at best some tag-team editing going on &amp; I suspect a sock IP edit on one of the talk pages. I'm not really experienced enough in the wikiworld to know whether it is is worth taking further or how to do it. [[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 08:25, 19 October 2012 (UTC)
:Hi again, TheLongTone, and thanks for your kind message. 
:My personal editing philosophy includes trying to reduce the amount of unnecessary on-wiki drama. In this case, I thought I'd also let the editor know that [[singular they|their]] edits may also cause unnecessary ''off-wiki'' drama.  That is because I am the nicest person in the entire world.{{dubious|date=October 2012}}
:And no, no-one's [[Teaching grandmother to suck eggs|granny needs lessons]] here. I've been here a long while, and often ask other editors for help with what might seem to them klewless moob questions; for example, I'm still hopelessly naive about most of the techy workings of the software.
:As for the &lt;small&gt;&lt;lawyer&gt;&lt;/small&gt; alleged allegations of allegations of alleged sockpuppetry allegations &lt;small&gt;&lt;/lawyer&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, do you have [[WP:TWINKLE]] switched on in your userprefs?  It will guide you through the process of adding a [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations]] case.  Let me know if you have any questions about this, or anything else.  (Caveat: I may have no clue how to answer them.)
:Hope this helps, as the - aaargh! - cliche goes. --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 09:38, 19 October 2012 (UTC)
::And I thought that I was the nicest person in all the world. Seriously, I don't think a single IP edit is worth a sockpuppet investiation, but the obvious collusion of the two editors possibly is especially since it seems to be commercially motivated:would that be ANI/spam?. Actually, I'd rather be editing articles than doing this, but it's a good outlet for ill temper... [[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 09:45, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

Hi, you say in the ANI thread [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Repeated_accusations_that_editors_who_disagree_with_the_reported_editor_are_biased_etc.|here]] that German Wikipedia has much more stringent standards relating to notability of companies.

==re:Deletion of vidiby?==

The reasons you cited for deleting vidiby.com the article were &quot;advertising&quot; &amp; &quot;content copies straight from website&quot;.  Please provide explanation since the deletion contest was posted on the talk page explaining exactly that (NOT advertising nor content &quot;copied&quot;).  The article was tagged for deletion for notability as well (A7) and NOT G11 or G12.  I think you mods are getting off on a power-trip and are judging articles outside of your field of expertise (e-commerce aint field hockey son and seriously field hockey in australia??).  Please at least have the &quot;wiki&quot; mod decency and reply to the speedy deletion contest posted on the talk page and explain why its deleted for reasons other than the reason it was originally tagged.  If you can't even provide that you shouldn't be a wiki mod, unless you're 50 and still single, then maybe I'll understand.

Also, deletion of your talk page is pending, you can contest the deletion by replying to this deletion response.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Thebaysfinest|Thebaysfinest]] ([[User talk:Thebaysfinest|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thebaysfinest|contribs]]) 22:44, 31 October 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== GaHee Park contributions ==

Thanks for stopping by my student edits! You are welcome to interact however much you want with the students, I actually want them to learn that by editing Wikipedia they get to interact with people all over the world. So by all means, feel free to leave my student(s) a message, correct their edits and such. In fact, if you could tell GaHee Park what she did wrong and explain how you fixed it, or such, it would be great :) PS. Are you familiar with the [[WP:AMBASSADOR]] program?

==Hatchling==
Sigh... Pete, there is so much wrong with this that my first instinct was to delete. Apart from the lack of referencing, the definition is suspect, the bird section is only partially correct and the puffling bit (not in my dictionary btw) seems to refer to juveniles, not hatchlings.

== Why a removal of TBA (Tarja album)? ==

Hi,

This isn't the first time I've gotten a similar deletion of something I've put up. I think that we have enough information about the upcoming album to be able to have a wikipage about it?
Or what do you want me to do so I can keep it? I'm not very good a wikipedia but I really like this to stay and have other ppl continue to make it better as some other pages I've made.

== Options ==

[[WP:N]] is quite clear. When a proposed article fails to meet our requirements for a stand alone article such as the clear requirements at [[WP:NFF]], there are multiple options and one of them is redirecting to a parent article. [[WP:BURDEN]] is also very clear that there is '''only one''' option for content that has been removed by challenge - providing a citation to a reliably published source before restoration. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;;;&quot;&gt;TRPoD &lt;small&gt;aka The Red Pen of Doom&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 11:49, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

: Not many sources exist online except for the official websites of his organisation. His movement is one of the growing campaigns in the media and activist-organisations in the wake of the end of the Civil War in Sri lanka and the crimes inflicted upon the native Tamil populace. His organisation is based in [[Chennai]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] rather than Sri Lanka. Google and other search engines only offer news-related content and very rare biographical sources are available online. So I just created this article in brevity and save expansion for the future. Check it again, and please comment whether the links there are sufficient for ''undeletion'' of the article.Thank you.--[[User:Coppercholride|CuCl2]] 14:26, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for March 31==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Ari-soo]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Wastewater treatment plant]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Ari-soo|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Ari-soo|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

== NPP ==

Hi Pete. First off a quick apology for not replying to you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yunshui&amp;diff=547425027&amp;oldid=547407217 here]; there was this thing with eggs and chocolate and rabbits that sort of kept me off-wiki for a few days... Looking at your message, though, I did have a question: do you recall if you came across the [[Chaesang]] article through NPP, as your message suggests? I ask because last time I checked I had the autopatrolled flag, so my created articles shouldn't be bogging down new page patrollers - if they are, it suggests something's gone a bit wrong.

== [[Map of china]] ==

You would have been right to move this to [[Map of China]] as its correct title, but moving it to [[Map of China (sculpture)]] wasn't necessary. It doesn't need a disambiguator, as there is no other Wikipedia article called &quot;Map of China&quot;: &quot;more precise article name&quot; doesn't come into it really. Plenty of artworks, songs, etc have titles which don't convey what they are, but the article title should be that title, unless there is a clash with another Wikipedia article. I've moved it to what I believe is the correct title.

This has been done under two or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], by which articles can be deleted at any time, without discussion. If the page meets any of these strictly-defined criteria, then it may be soon be deleted by an administrator. The reasons it has been tagged are:
* It seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. (See [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information.
*It appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. (See [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. &lt;p&gt;If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]].

== Author Melissa White (Authoress Melissa White) ==

Hi Shirt58!

Sorry for the late reply. I was just following the notability requirements below:

1. The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times.
2. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field.

I feel like the fact that an experienced user like you felt that there may be notability should have overridden my feeling and resulted in the preservation of the page. Personally, I felt that even though the subject created so many television programs, she was still not notable because there was no indication that it was a significant contribution to her field. All I really wanted the author of the article to do was add more references and I put the deletion tag more out of formality. I wish the author contested rather than just delete my deletion tag. I'm sorry to see that the page was eventually deleted. I hope the user comes back...

Both sources cited about the Indian bid are over one year ago, so I do not know how legit the bid remains. Actually there has been no announcement from FIFA about the bidding process and schedule of the 2015 FCWC (it is not included in the FIFA tournaments open for the latest rounds of bidding: [http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/congress/news/newsid=2085775/index.html]). It is probable that the 2015 FCWC will just return to Japan as per the cycle currently in place (but I do not have any source).

Dear Shirt,

I was following and contributing to an article ''ACE College of Engineering'' which unfortunate was deleted following your comments. ACE College of Engineering is a genuine Engineering College started this year in [[Kerala]]. You can check the site [www.acein.ac.in]. It had nothing to do with 'ACE Engineering Academy' in Hydrabad.

Hi,

I already created the page with the correct name: &quot;Yangi Qaleh Airport&quot;.  I don't know how to delete the page with the incorrect name: &quot;Yangi Qala Airport&quot;.  I had the same problem with the page &quot;Pan Jao Airport&quot; which now is &quot;Panjab Airport&quot;.  How can I fix such mistakes in the future?  I have an extensive database of airports, and I am sure there will be similar problems in the future.

Dear Deb thanks for the speculation but let me confirm that i am not the User ritvikvikasmishra,though he has been a fellow professor.Dr Vikas Mishra has been an iconic figure through his contributions in economics,but since there has been a constant problem with the article i was advised by the user to join wikipedia which i did.It rely amuses me that without any knowledge of what the article is about you coined it ''Bad''.If you wish to know more about the economist you should go through the pages of your own articles like Sir Arthur Lewis,Hanumantha Rao,Mn Srinivas etc some of whom have regularly quoted Prof Mishra's work.I am sorry but though a day old user i feel that there is a heavy baseless profiling by users like you without proper information.I am an economist myself and clearly knew the importance of the article for not only the economists in India but veteran economists around the globe therfore i had copied the source by the above user a few days back and used the same for the article.I think as a responsible user of the wikipedia community profiling of article without knowing what it is should be avoided  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Truestar ray|Truestar ray]] ([[User talk:Truestar ray|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Truestar ray|contribs]]) 13:58, 18 August 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 23:35, 10 September 2013 (UTC)

== Joao Carlos Teixeira ==

Is there any way to recover the [[Joao Carlos Teixeira]] article for when this player makes his first team debut in English football, which could be for [[Brentford F.C.]] on Saturday September 14?

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Keshi yena]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Edam]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Keshi_yena|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Keshi_yena|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 13:04, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Macrothink Institute]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Macrothink Institute]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''Non-notable publisher of open-access journals. Not a single one of their journals currently meets either [[WP:NJournals]] or [[WP:GNG]]. Only claim to notability is being listed on Beall's list of [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory open access publishers]] (and, apparently, having released a press release voicing support for Wikipedia - see Signpost of this week).'''

While all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Macrothink Institute|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 17:42, 13 September 2013 (UTC)


== About [[Al Eqtisadiah]] and [[Aleqtsadia]]  ==
{{tlp|admin help}}
Two articles about the same newspaper, both with page histories. [[Wikipedia:Merging]]? [[Wikipedia:How to fix cut-and-paste moves#Parallel versions]]? I really don't have a clue. Help plz! --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58#top|talk]]) 13:30, 15 September 2013 (UTC)
:You're right that merging histories would be a mess. The first article was there first and is much the fuller, in fact I don't think anything needs to be merged from the second, so I have simply redirected the second to the first. That way the history and contributions to the second are preserved. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 13:40, 15 September 2013 (UTC)

== Back in mainspace ==

I reverted the deletion for [[A World Upside Down: The Mixxtape]]. I removed the table so nobody else would miss the source you added.

== Assistance with the deletion review process for the D-Cubed article ==

Hi Peter,

Over on Crisco 1492's talk page you kindly offered to help with the next steps in the deletion review process for this article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Cubed

Would you mind pointing me in the right direction?

Best regards, MingleLane

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 23:32, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

== Rename needed ==

Can you take care of this move: [[Talk:Stinging_nettle#Article_title]]? Thank you. [[User:HalfGig|HalfGig]] ([[User talk:HalfGig|talk]]) 01:35, 3 October 2013 (UTC)



== Talkback 15:10, 3 October 2013 (UTC) ==

{{Tb|Fat&amp;Happy|Speedy deletion declined: Category:Italian-American actors}}

== Thanks for the barny! ==

Rescue work can be a lot of fun if it pans out and is a subject one likes. I enjoyed it! Thanks so much for the barnstar! [[User:Softlavender|Softlavender]] ([[User talk:Softlavender|talk]]) 22:48, 3 October 2013 (UTC)

== Request for un-deletion/copy of an aritlce ==

Hi, I saw you that deleted the page [[Appsfire]] after an investigation in which the user who created the article was blocked and banned. I wanted to create the article by myself and saw that it had already existed, so I have a question: Is there a way to find the previous deleted version, revise it, and then upload it again? Regards, [[User:Yambaram|Yambaram]] ([[User talk:Yambaram|talk]]) 08:45, 4 October 2013 (UTC)

== Speedy deletion declined ==

Thanks for letting me know that you have declined a speedy deletion nomination I made. I nominated it, rather than simply deleting it, because I was in some doubt, and wanted a second opinion, which you have now given me, and that is great. However, I think the manner in which you informed me of that second opinion was perhaps less than ideal. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 15:48, 5 October 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for October 6==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Datnioides microlepis]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Musi River]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Datnioides_microlepis|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Datnioides_microlepis|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 11:44, 6 October 2013 (UTC)

== Articles you might like to edit, from SuggestBot ==

We are currently running a study on the effects of adding additional information to SuggestBot's suggestions. Participation in the study is voluntary. Should you wish to not participate in the study, or have questions or concerns, you can find contact information on the [http://www.grouplens.org/node/494 SuggestBot study page].

'''IMPORTANT CHANGES:''' We have modified the selection of articles SuggestBot suggests and altered the design to incorporate more information about the articles, as [[#Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions|described in this explanation]].

''Note:'' All columns in this table are sortable, allowing you to rearrange the table so the articles most interesting to you are shown at the top.  All images have mouse-over popups with more information.

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 23:48, 8 October 2013 (UTC)

== Salamanca AC ==

OK, your right, i know the politics about Wikipedia, i'm 6 years in the Spanish Wikipedia and i'm patroller in there. My reason for add that template is because the team hasn't license for playing, so the club dissapear without play. 

I'm imagine you doesn't want delete it, me neither but what do i do. Well, a question, what do you think make a redirection with the Salamanca AC to [[Unión Deportiva Salamanca]]?. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 18:20, 20 October 2013 (UTC)
: You don't answer me yet. What do you think about a redirection to Unión Deportiva Salamanca. If you still without response, i understand you said yes and will redirect myself the Salamanca AC to the UDS. In the Spanish Wikipedia, we had to do the same. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 10:17, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
:: Well, the politics in this Wikipedia are different with respect to the Spanish one. In there we had a discussión about its relevance, but we agree to redirect until the LFP (Spanish League) and the RFEF (Spanish Football Federation) says they last words about it, and said &quot;Without license, no allowed to compete&quot;, that's the problem: exists, but don't play football since the league begun, [http://www.marca.com/estadisticas/futbol/segundab/grupo_1/ Still appear like &quot;Equipo 20&quot;], however, the Salamanca AC is (or ''was'' better said) the UD Salamanca's succesor after their disolution. I'm sorry cos i can't find any news in your language (what do you expect about a Spanish poor team?). You know what?, i'm going to es.wiki to ask for a second opinion about the theme. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 14:29, 22 October 2013 (UTC)

== Articles you might like to edit, from SuggestBot ==

We are currently running a study on the effects of adding additional information to SuggestBot's suggestions. Participation in the study is voluntary. Should you wish to not participate in the study, or have questions or concerns, you can find contact information on the [http://www.grouplens.org/node/494 SuggestBot study page].

'''IMPORTANT CHANGES:''' We have modified the selection of articles SuggestBot suggests and altered the design to incorporate more information about the articles, as [[#Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions|described in this explanation]].

''Note:'' All columns in this table are sortable, allowing you to rearrange the table so the articles most interesting to you are shown at the top.  All images have mouse-over popups with more information.

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 23:48, 22 October 2013 (UTC)


== So Fresh Individual albums notability ==

Hi Shirt, you might be interested to read my comments at the &quot;So Fresh&quot; talk page at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:So_Fresh.  I'm just trying to get some consensus as I can fill in the missing compilation articles. [[User:Whitewater111|Whitewater111]] ([[User talk:Whitewater111|talk]]) 01:05, 26 October 2013 (UTC)

== No problems ==

If you are referring to a Moldovan, that is. Can't find any Romanians. I didn't bother because there wasn't any close contact info present. If it's done, it'll need doing to the user page, too (didn't look at that - should have, I suppose). I usually only call for oversight for younger ones who give email addresses or even school names or phone numbers. [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 11:39, 26 October 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for October 26==

== Salamanca AC ==

OK, your right, i know the politics about Wikipedia, i'm 6 years in the Spanish Wikipedia and i'm patroller in there. My reason for add that template is because the team hasn't license for playing, so the club dissapear without play. 

I'm imagine you doesn't want delete it, me neither but what do i do. Well, a question, what do you think make a redirection with the Salamanca AC to [[Unión Deportiva Salamanca]]?. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 18:20, 20 October 2013 (UTC)
: You don't answer me yet. What do you think about a redirection to Unión Deportiva Salamanca. If you still without response, i understand you said yes and will redirect myself the Salamanca AC to the UDS. In the Spanish Wikipedia, we had to do the same. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 10:17, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
:: Well, the politics in this Wikipedia are different with respect to the Spanish one. In there we had a discussión about its relevance, but we agree to redirect until the LFP (Spanish League) and the RFEF (Spanish Football Federation) says they last words about it, and said &quot;Without license, no allowed to compete&quot;, that's the problem: exists, but don't play football since the league begun, [http://www.marca.com/estadisticas/futbol/segundab/grupo_1/ Still appear like &quot;Equipo 20&quot;], however, the Salamanca AC is (or ''was'' better said) the UD Salamanca's succesor after their disolution. I'm sorry cos i can't find any news in your language (what do you expect about a Spanish poor team?). You know what?, i'm going to es.wiki to ask for a second opinion about the theme. --[[User:Ravave|Ravave]] ([[User talk:Ravave|talk]]) 14:29, 22 October 2013 (UTC)

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 23:48, 22 October 2013 (UTC)


== So Fresh Individual albums notability ==

Hi Shirt, you might be interested to read my comments at the &quot;So Fresh&quot; talk page at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:So_Fresh.  I'm just trying to get some consensus as I can fill in the missing compilation articles. [[User:Whitewater111|Whitewater111]] ([[User talk:Whitewater111|talk]]) 01:05, 26 October 2013 (UTC)

== No problems ==

If you are referring to a Moldovan, that is. Can't find any Romanians. I didn't bother because there wasn't any close contact info present. If it's done, it'll need doing to the user page, too (didn't look at that - should have, I suppose). I usually only call for oversight for younger ones who give email addresses or even school names or phone numbers. [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 11:39, 26 October 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for October 26==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that you've added some links pointing to [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]].

=== Changes to SuggestBot's suggestions ===

We have changed the number of suggested articles and which categories they are selected from.  The number of stubs has been greatly reduced, the number of articles needing sources doubled, and two new categories added (orphans and unencyclopaedic articles).  We have also modified the layout of the suggestions and added sortable columns with various types of information about each article.  The first two columns are:

; Views/Day : Daily average number of views an article's had over the past 14 days.
; Quality : Predicted article quality on a 1- to 3-star scale.  Placing your cursor over the stars should give you a pop-up describing the article's quality (Low/Medium/High), current [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|assessment class]], and predicted assessment class.

The method we use to predict article quality also allows us to assess whether an article might need specific types of work in order to improve its quality.  The work needed might not correspond to cleanup tags added to the article, since our method is not based on those.  We have added five columns reflecting this work assessment, where a red X indicates improvement is needed.  Placing your cursor over an X should give you a pop-up with a short description of the work needed.    The five columns seek to answer the following five questions:

; Content : Is more content needed?
; Headings : Does this article have an appropriate section structure?
; Images : Is the number of illustrative images about right?
; Links : Does this article link to enough other Wikipedia articles?
; Sources : For its length, is there an appropriate number of citations to sources in this article?

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 01:11, 6 November 2013 (UTC)

== Articles you might like to edit, from SuggestBot ==

We are currently running a study on the effects of adding additional information to SuggestBot's suggestions. Participation in the study is voluntary. Should you wish to not participate in the study, or have questions or concerns, you can find contact information on the [http://www.grouplens.org/node/494 SuggestBot study page].

''Note:'' All columns in this table are sortable, allowing you to rearrange the table so the articles most interesting to you are shown at the top.  All images have mouse-over popups with more information.  For more information about the columns and categories, please[[User:SuggestBot/Documentation/Suggestion columns|consult the documentation]], and please do get in touch on [[User talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]] with any questions you might have.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 14:09, 7 November 2013 (UTC)

== Articles you might like to edit, from SuggestBot ==

We are currently running a study on the effects of adding additional information to SuggestBot's suggestions. Participation in the study is voluntary. Should you wish to not participate in the study, or have questions or concerns, you can find contact information on the [http://www.grouplens.org/node/494 SuggestBot study page].

''Note:'' All columns in this table are sortable, allowing you to rearrange the table so the articles most interesting to you are shown at the top.  All images have mouse-over popups with more information.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 20:53, 8 November 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for November 20==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Sparkling Shiraz]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[James Halliday]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Sparkling_Shiraz|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Sparkling_Shiraz|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:17, 20 November 2013 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for November 26==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Chrétien François de Lamoignon de Basville]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Statesman]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Chr%C3%A9tien_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Lamoignon_de_Basville|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Chr%C3%A9tien_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Lamoignon_de_Basville|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

==&lt;s&gt;Hello&lt;/s&gt; ==

&lt;s&gt;Hi Pete, how are you today? I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'm wondering if you could help me. You just posted the following comment, addressed to me, on an unrelated [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Ridiculous|ANI]];&lt;br&gt;
{{tq|&quot;''Thewolfchild: [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive820#User:Beyond_My_Ken|A little while ago]] you wrote &quot;I'm looking to avoid fights these days...&quot; It appears that you have made - by my probably flawed count - about 34 WP:AN/I posts in the last seven days. WP:AN/I is pretty much the fightin'-est place in en.wikipedia.org. Perhaps it would be for the best if you took a little break from posting here, and worked on articles and reverting vandalism for a while. Pete aka - Shirt58 12:50, 1 December 2013 (UTC)''&quot;}}&lt;br&gt;
I have to admit that I'm at a loss to understand the purpose behind these remarks. On first impression, they seem somewhat... well, &lt;small&gt;(let's not go ''there'')&lt;/small&gt;. I'm sure this is just a miscommunication of some sort. If you would be so kind as to clarify this for me, I would certainly appreciate it. Thanks, Pete. -  ''[[User: Thewolfchild|&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Matisse itc;color:red&quot;&gt;WOLF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;child&lt;/small&gt;]]'' 15:20, 1 December 2013 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
::{{tps}} The purpose and meaning seems pretty clear and straightforward to me:  If you're not looking for trouble, stop screwing with people at ANI. I'd broaden that to a more general, stop looking for problems with others' edits and focus on your own, which the community has unambiguously said need to change.[[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk: Toddst1|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:27, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

== King cobra ==

The king cobra is not a species which is considered to be especially aggressive, not like the forest cobra or black mamba, which are known to be very aggressive among scientists. National Geographic, or that page in particular (which the link to was broken), is a basically an article - written by an editor based on loose facts. Yes, when &quot;cornered it can be aggressive&quot;, but so can a tiny coral snake. So what? Famous biologist and expert on king cobras, [[Michael Tweedie]] made this claim regarding its nature: ''&quot;this notion is based on the general tendency to dramatise all attributes of snakes with little regard for the truth about them. A moment’s reflection shows that this must be so, for the species [king cobra] is not uncommon, even in populated areas, and consciously or unconsciously, people must encounter king cobras quite frequently. If the snake were really habitually aggressive records of its bite would be frequent; as it is they are extremely rare.&quot;'' (Tweedie, M. The Snakes of Malaya (1983). Other scientists have observed that it is not an aggressive species at all, but rather placid and timid. ''&quot;but scientists claim that their &quot;legendary aggressiveness&quot;'' is grossly exaggerated....In most of the local encounters with live, wild king cobras, the snakes appear to be of rather placid disposition, and they usually end up being killed or subdued with hardly any hysterics. (Greene, HW (1997). Snakes: The Evolution of Mystery in Nature. California, USA: University of California Press. ISBN 0520224876). Even for such a large snake, their bites are often non-fatal (Mathew, Gera, JL, T. &quot;http://www.priory.com/med/ophitoxaemia.htm&quot;. MEDICINE ON-LINE. Retrieved 20 October 2013.) - unlike the black mamba or coastal taipan (or even some true Naja cobra species like the forest cobra, Cape cobra or Caspian cobra). Forest cobras and black mambas are two of the most aggressive snake species on earth, while the black mamba and coastal taipan are considered to be the most dangerous species in the world. (Haji, R. &quot;[http://www.zoocheck.com/Reportpdfs/Venomous%20snakes.pdf Venomous snakes and snake bites]&quot;. Zoocheck Canada.

===Clarification===
Hi Thewolfchild, and thanks for your message. You wrote earlier:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm looking to avoid fights these days and that's what I'm going to, despite these provocations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I suggested
* that you avoided posting at the incidents notice board; and,
* that you worked on articles and reverting vandalism instead.
That's it. That's all. &lt;br /&gt;
If you feel this is another &quot;provocation&quot;, then I regret I may not be of much further help.&lt;br /&gt;

::And thank you for replying (though I prefer to keep the comments to one page) Forgive my confusion, but your comment followed a comment I had made both condemning vandalism and supporting account creation. It was not directed at any specific editor and I don't see how it is controversial. As far as I know, I am not prohibited from taking part in ANI discussions, so I am at a loss to understand why you and ''another editor'' seem to be implying that I am (or should be), and are putting in such an effort to deter me from that board. Surly there are some much larger and more pressing issues for admins to be focused on, no? And many, many people contribute to ANI, some in ways that are counter-productive or even violate policy (ie: NPA, civility, baiting, etc.) Why is it you are focused on me? I'm not looking for your &quot;''help''&quot;, I just want to understand your comments to me and the reason behind them. Thank. -  ''[[User: Thewolfchild|&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Matisse itc;color:red&quot;&gt;WOLF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;child&lt;/small&gt;]]'' 19:34, 2 December 2013 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;(I will look for your response here)&lt;/small&gt;

:::OK then... I see you have been quite active since I posted this question above, and apparently you have no intention of answering.

== Vibroacoustic Therapy ==
*&quot;Contemporary Vibroacoustic Therapy: Perspectives on Clinical Practice, Research, and Training Marko Pukanen and Esa Ala-Ruona. Music and Medicine 2012 4:128,originally published online 17 May 2012&quot;
Abstract
Vibroacoustic therapy (VAT) traditionally considered to be a physical and receptive type of music therapy intervention, uses pulsed, sinusoidal, low-frequency sound on a specially designed bed or chair. Today VAT is viewed as a multimodal approach, whereby the therapist works with the client’s physiological and psychological experiences, incorporating a mind–body approach. This article provides current knowledge in clinical practice emphasizing the systematic and documented implementations of VAT. This includes presentation and explication of the key elements of VAT, assessments, treatment plans and procedures, documentation, and evaluation of the treatment with recommendations for follow-up care in health and rehabilitation. Recent research is presented, and directions for future research are considered. Applicable views on clinical training and required competencies are outlined.

You don't think that page is promotional?  It cites mostly the company's website (biased) and pay for inclusion news articles they created. It only talks about how great they are.  If you search for them elsewhere on the net, you will see a myriad of scam complaints, ripoff reports, BBB complaints, etc.  The last article about them was removed, and it had the same things.

Hi Shirt58,

In regards to Shahid.net, I have left a comment clearly stating that it is not violating copyrights yet it still got deleted, it is my job here at [[MBC Group]] as a member of the social media team to help create wikipages about the MBC Group social properties similar to Shahid.net for informative non advertising purposes, I would appreciate it if you would undo the deletion, and appreciate the time I am investing creating the pages instead of burning my efforts.

Happy New Year

==Disambiguation link notification for January 2==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Out of Sight (novel)]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Christopher Orr]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Out_of_Sight_%28novel%29|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Out_of_Sight_%28novel%29|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:07, 2 January 2014 (UTC)

== G7. Author requests deletion ==

:''&quot;If requested in good faith and provided that the '''only substantial content''' to the page and to the associated talk page was added by its author.&quot;''

I see '''zero''' substantial content additions to the article, just vandalisms or unhelpful additions of nonsourced contents and reversions of these additions. I'm requesting deletion after [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29&amp;diff=588742377&amp;oldid=588715372 this] modification to notability (people) criteria.[[User:Cavarrone|'''C'''avarrone]]  12:51, 2 January 2014 (UTC)

Hi Shirts!

I saw that you posted a message that [[User:Artofantonia]] was trying to post a message on my user page. The only thing that I've seen her do to my user page is to blank it. Am I missing something?

No need to TalkBack or post on my user talk page, I'll watch.

==re: iainplunkett==

Hi Shirt58,

Thanks for posting a response on my user page. As you can tell I am kind of mew to all this. 

Let me start by saying that I am, in no way, trying to use Wikipedia as a marketing device for clients. I am extremely happy to abide by any form of editorial approval process that you'd like to set in place - unfortunately, I was unaware that such a thing existed. I guess I may not have read up enough before I started.

The thing is that I hope you understand that clients will approach me and ask me to correct what they feel are factual inaccuracies or things they think are sufficiently clear or referenced. (They will also try to get their marketing messages in there but I do feel its my role to stop them from doing that!) If we put in place a good approval process, will this be OK? 

I have to say that I'm a little worried about your comments about my changes being undone as I tried to ensure, at the time, that I was following the rules and the discussion I had I thought that's what I had achieved.

I'm also a little confused about your comments on multiple users of an account. Let me assure you that I am the only person that uses - and will ever use - the iainplunkett account. It's my name so I am trying to be as transparent as possible. Is this what you were suggesting? 

Can I also ask a question about Conflict of Interest. I think for most companies, Wikipedia isn't about marketing as about reputation management. If something appears on Wikipedia that is inaccurate and potentially harmful, as long as the edits that are made to address this are neutral and properly referenced (and approved) is it Ok for them to be made? If so, who should make them? It appears to me that it is people connected to that company that are likely to take the time and effort to address the issue as they are, by far, the most likely to care. Is there an alternative approach available? 

Please let me know what you think. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

==Hi==
hello Shirt58, I'm [[User:Nechlison|Nechlison]] , there is recently created page see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alapati_Dharma_Rao] about biography of politician. I tagged it for speedy deletion and it was reverted by some one else, as the page completely shows promotion without managing good references(All references are based on Web:URL as we know that [[WP:ELNO|'Links to avoid', #11]] sites may not be linked as they may contains information in violation of the creator's copyright)  and reliable sources and article is not written in encyclopedic way. Can you please put your eye for few minutes on the article ? Thanks. [[User:Nechlison|Nechlison]] ([[User talk:Nechlison|talk]]) 13:50, 13 January 2014 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

== Speedy deletion declined: [[:The Seoul Times]] ==
I'll gladly put it up for more thorough review, as it consists of one sentence sourced to an article that is about the original, different, and notable &quot;Seoul Times&quot; - which is not the topic of the article - and then one promotional sentence with a single reference: the Web site that is the non-notable topic of the article.

==Disambiguation link notification for January 25==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Kölnischer Kunstverein]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Kunstverein]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/K%C3%B6lnischer_Kunstverein|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/K%C3%B6lnischer_Kunstverein|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:05, 25 January 2014 (UTC)

== Why? ==

&lt;s&gt;Sorry, that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tonya_Cardoza&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=593426453 move] was quite unwelcome.

It isn't ready. Plus it royally messed up some edits I was trying to make, and couldn't understand why content had disappeared.&lt;/s&gt;
The only thing royally messed up was my assumption I had started that in user space. I went to [[Special:PrefixIndex/User:Sphilbrick]], then created Sphilbrick/Tonya Cardoza, totally spacing on the fact that &quot;User:&quot; was needed. Mea culpa.--[[User:Sphilbrick|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light&quot;&gt;S Philbrick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|&lt;span style=&quot;;padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light&quot;&gt;(Talk)&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:43, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for February 13==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Miles Hammond]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Bowler]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Miles_Hammond|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Miles_Hammond|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:07, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 01:21, 18 February 2014 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for February 20==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Sady Doyle]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Blogger]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Sady_Doyle|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Sady_Doyle|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:05, 20 February 2014 (UTC)

== [[Hopia Legaspi]] ==

Hey, I declined the hoax tag because of [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1923980/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 this IMDb entry]. At the same time, I'm concerned because my first thought when seeing the article was of [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Katrina Villegas]]. I'm going to go ahead and endorse the CU, and we'll see what happens from there.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 16:05, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

==Re: [[Anupam Mazumdar]]==

Sorry about the incorrect speedy deletion nomination (G7). I only very recently started checking new pages, and the CSD page doesn't make it completely clear exactly what's notable and what not. I will do a bit more of a background check before tagging in the future. Once again sorry about the error. [[User:Knyzna1|Knyzna1]] ([[User talk:Knyzna1|talk]]) 13:15, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for March 8==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Samar Day]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Foundation Day]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Samar_Day|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Samar_Day|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:05, 8 March 2014 (UTC)

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Hubertus Antonius van der Aa]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person, organization (band, club, company, ''etc.''), web content or organised event, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please read more about [[Wikipedia:Notability (summary)|what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Hubertus Antonius van der Aa|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt;  [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 01:58, 16 March 2014 (UTC)


===Status and Advice=== 
 
As reviewing administrator,  I didn't delete it, but you ''must'' give some more information, or it probably will be. You shouldn't just add the name from the directory--you need to give information about  the species he described, along with links to their publication. I'll go find it if I have to, but you presumably have the information at hand. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 21:39, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

==VV Oosterhout==
Hello, I am writing in regard to your recent speedy deletion of VV Oosterhout. I do not understand why the article pertaining to this club was deleted. The club currently play in the 5th tier of Dutch football (Derde Klasse) and are arguably the best club from Oosterhout (along with maybe SCO/TOFS) They have competed in professional and amateur level football since 1927 and I am not clear on why the page was removed so quickly. If it is possible to reinstate the page I would appreciate it. I was not finished with it as my in laws came to visit and I had to put it down, only to find it had been removed. I have added links to print media talking about the club, and it is definitely noteworthy of an article (Wikipedia has articles for clubs competing in lower levels then VV Oosterhout). If you could please explain why the page was removed it would be much appreciated. Regards, ([[User:Subzzee|Subzzee]] ([[User talk:Subzzee|talk]]) 00:39, 23 March 2014 (UTC))

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

your lucid editing in an otherwise impenetrable thicket. It makes my day when I come across unfamiliar editors who manage that. Cheers [[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 18:16, 6 February 2014 (UTC)

Yes, I agree.

Hello. You declined my SD nomination of this page. But an IP user removed the tag immediately when it was tagged for improvement see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_New_House&amp;diff=603439615&amp;oldid=603438469'''here''']. I think IP editor and creator of page might have close connection or may be both are same, editing page without log in.

Good question - no, I don't think it can be included. It's [http://tasmania.com/itineraries/tasmania-short-walk-itineraries/battery-point-historic-walking-tour/ listed here], but we would hardly include the other things on that page. It's got the barest mention in the Lonely Planet guide, and isn't described as a landmark. I see that it is indeed a landmark in the technical sense, but that's not really what the template is about. But if you're interested in Hobart churches, perhaps you'd like to think about creating an article on [[St Mary's Cathedral, Hobart|St Mary's Cathedral]]?

==Disambiguation link notification for May 1==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Glenda Hall]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Board President's XI]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Glenda_Hall|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Glenda_Hall|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 10:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

== Der Klassiker - ==

Hey thanks! Goes to show what happens when one never finishes it! It was like how a few weeks ago I saw a senator's stub completely unfinished with just his picture! Same has happened even with Oscar winning screenwriters and Olympians! (Okay those last 2 are just plain odd even!)
Goes to show how putting a deletion can sometimes help the article! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:56, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

==Wikilinking==
Hi, and thanks for your work on the English Wikipedia. 

I noticed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Rosenberg&amp;diff=608053777&amp;oldid=607950607 an article] you worked on. Just a short note to point out that we don’t normally link:
*dates
*years
*commonly known geographical terms (including well-known country-names), and
*common terms you’d look up in a dictionary (unless significantly technical).

This applies to infoboxes, too.

Please note the harmonised date formats.

Thanks, and my best wishes.

== Warning ==

You're going to find yourself in a lot of trouble if you continue to abuse other editors, as you've just done [[User_talk:Tony1#Stuff_your_pompous_self-righteousness_up_your_arse|here]]. That in itself might get you blocked if you're perceived as disruptive to the site.

==Disambiguation link notification for May 14==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Sally Moffat]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Bowler]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Sally_Moffat|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Sally_Moffat|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

==On Gija Wiman FourCommanderiesofHan==
As soon as you blocked Gija Wiman FourCommanderiesofHan, another single purpose account, Collision787[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Collision787] started to make similar reverts. I now suspect that there are three single purpose socks, and I have taken this to sockpuppet investigation[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Collision787]. Pending results from this sockpuppet investigation, can you please protect the articles under contention, which are [[Timeline of Korean history]] and [[Template:History of Manchuria]]? Thank you.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 11:50, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

== User:No more usernames,eh? ==

It's a persistent troll/vandal, has been using throwaway accounts to target Smalljim. [[User:DuncanHill|DuncanHill]] ([[User talk:DuncanHill|talk]]) 13:44, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[London First]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[London First]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''not notable. does not meet [[WP:ORG]].'''

While all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:London First|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; -- [[user:aunva6|Aunva6]]&lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:aunva6|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Aunva6|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt;  15:09, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

== [[Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest]] ==

Sorry. I was looking for an excuse to delete that. I'll just turn it into a redirect, and merge the little relevant info into the parent article, though it has nearly a dozen redundant redirects already.[[User:מהמברטה|מהמברטה]] ([[User talk:מהמברטה|talk]]) 16:10, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

==Incomplete DYK nomination==

[[Image:Symbol question.svg|25px]] Hello!

== [[BSG Chemie Leipzig]] ==

You accidentally deleted the page twice, and it's now circular redirect. Could you fix this?

== Note, article on USMC staff sear gents will be deleted ==

…so material needs to be archived from it, to include in other articles, or you and others need to make the case for it to exist as a standalone article.  Cheers.

== Re: Minor trolling at ANI ==

Not sure if this is responsive to what you didn't understand about the thread, but if you take that username and put it in a hexidecimal-to-[[ASCII]] converter, it produces &quot;Fuck you!&quot; User had also categorized two other usernames (one was also &quot;Fuck you!&quot; in hex, but without spaces between the octets, while the other was &quot;Fuck you&quot; in [[Base64]]). Like the thread title suggested, it's minor. I've got to agree that I find humor in Classical Chinese to be a lot more satisfying. —/[[User:Mendaliv|'''M'''&lt;small&gt;endaliv&lt;/small&gt;]]/&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Mendaliv|2¢]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Mendaliv|Δ's]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/ 04:10, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

== Could you please explain... ==

You deleted the redirect [[Michael Dunlavey]], with the deletion log entry ''&quot;Recently created, implausible redirect&quot;''.  This entry mystifies me.  Isn't this kind of redirect both widely accepted and extremely common?  [[User:Geo Swan|Geo Swan]] ([[User talk:Geo Swan|talk]]) 04:04, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

[[Image:Symbol question.svg|25px]] Hello!

Please review the comment(s) underneath '''[[Template:Did you know nominations/Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2|your nomination's entry]]''' and respond there as soon as possible.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article or image appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. This article or image appears to be a direct copy from http://www.formakers.eu/project-140-school-description-case-center-for-architecture-science-and-ecolog. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''.

If the external website or image belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text or image — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website or image but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Theroadislong|Theroadislong]] ([[User talk:Theroadislong|talk]]) 20:31, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
:{{U|Theroadislong}}, the copyright violating material was added after the creation of the article. I've restored the article to before that point. In the future, I suggest you look more carefully at the history, particularly when the creator is an experienced editor.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 20:39, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

== Australian flags ==

I saw your opposition to removal of Eddie Mabo's image at [[Australians]]. I don't think we've crossed paths previously and I don't seem to remember seeing you at the [[WP:AWNB|Australian Wikipedians' notice board]] where I've opened a discussion that specifically mentions this image. You might care to read what I wrote if you haven't seen it. The discussion is titled [[Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board#Australian flags|Australian flags]]. I must say that I disagree with Werieth's interpretation of [[WP:NFCC]]. It's a policy with legal considerations so the language is clear but it seems to suffer from misinterpretation an awful lot. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Aussie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gold;&quot;&gt;Legend&lt;/span&gt;''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|&lt;big&gt;✉&lt;/big&gt;]]) 13:45, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

I think withdrawal is a reasonable course of action if you're happy with it. I think it's unlikely that anyone will argue deletion at this point, so it's not like there's much to be gained by leaving the discussion open.

== Thanks so much Peter! ==

Hello Peter, Thank you for the very nice new article on the nudibranch ''[[Tambja verconis]]''. This is a very welcome addition to Project Gastropods. I don't know if you have a particular interest in the subject of marine gastropods, but in case you do, I am giving you this invitation.

Hi Thue.  I've just re-created a page you deleted back in 2006:
* 20:00, 7 February 2006 Thue (talk | contribs | block) deleted page Sally Cooper (content was: '&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db|Redirect to empty page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;')
Hope this is OK with you! Peter in Australia aka --[[User:Shirt58|Shirt58]] ([[User talk:Shirt58|talk]]) 13:04, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

:Yeah sure. The page I deleted was empty, so there is no [[Prejudice (legal procedure)|prejudice]]. [[User:Thue|Thue]] ([[User talk:Thue|talk]]) 18:02, 22 June 2014 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thanks for the help with Sutton Hall disambiguation stuff. According to what I read in the guidelines I should have been able to do the page move myself since the page to be overwritten was just a one-liner auto-created redirect page from a previous page move I made, but alas it did not. Sorry for the inconvenience.  &amp;nbsp;&lt;font style=&quot;color:#ff7700;&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;●&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; '''[[User:Thane|Thane]]''' &amp;mdash; &lt;small&gt;formerly Guðsþegn&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp; 10:54, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

== Just curious... ==

Do you have any advice on if and how I should have handled [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Topic_ban_proposal_for_Gibson_Flying_V|this]] differently? Perhaps I was a bit blasé about responding initially because it's such an obvious [[WP:BOOMERANG]]. It's a bit of a time-consuming mess (to my detriment!), so I understand if you're too busy to reply.--[[User:Gibson Flying V|Gibson Flying V]] ([[User talk:Gibson Flying V|talk]]) 21:54, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

== Re:[[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[&quot;Jewish Motifs&quot; International Film Festival]] ==
i haven't got time to react and it's already deleted. How can i restore the article and improve it with references etc? It's pretty hard to write from scratch again. And please let me know how shall i also improve it since i was sure that the content of article was self-explanatory to the context of being 10-years old initiative in the important context of restoring Jewish culture in Poland. adding more references to article is a different thing and i agree. but it was deleted far too fast! - especially considering it was without discussion, only warning to me as author and it's summer time - people (even Wikipedians) go on summer holidays! :)
could you please help me, answer my doubts questions and asist in restoring article and improving it? thanks in advance! --[[User:Lantuszka|Lantuszka]] ([[User talk:Lantuszka|talk]]) 12:54, 9 July 2014 (UTC)

== Thanks again for your welcome, but... ==

... I don't understand why you have closed the discussion I was just in. In the opinion of the other users in the discussion I obviously used the wrong techniques in WP to react on the vandalism of another user. Fully accepted. But I am still convinced that my intention was absolutely right (none of the others proved something different, well, apparently they were not interested in). After explaining my intention 

I don't understand why the discussion is closed and that it is accepted (and supported) that 

a) [[User:Boing!_said_Zebedee]] is using slanguage against me,

b) I am getting blamed for its usage and its inappropriate reaction by user [[User_talk:DangerousPanda]], who impertinently claimed that I forced Boing! to be vulgar, brazen and disrespectful 

c) User [[User:NinjaRobotPirate]] is threatening me that I might held responsible for the disrespectful talk and behaviour of others, when I don't shut up (as I am willing to accept a contentless talk, that is not taking care of the discussed problem but supporting the disrespect? 

d) the discussion is closed after that, I do not have the chance to react on this contentstarving blahblah, my questions are not answered, and no one executes a warning to the user who vandalised another user's page 

BTW: A warning should have been my right reaction to the users vandalism - as I found out as a reaction to my [[WP:AIV]] post (but for which I was blamed, too) - but none of the commentators in the closed discussion could mention. (And I am still asking myself the question if vandalism on user pages needs a warning). 

Is this the standard in taking part in discussions in the english WP? Ex admins are supported loyal in overreacting and using slanguage against other users? Vandalism is accepted, the ones who are reporting vandalism are getting blamed? Intentions and reasons (which are the widely accepted basis for discussions or talks) are ignored? Vulgar terminology user are accepted as an vote for [[WP:Consensus]]? Users are threatening others to shut up and not to use reasons, arguments etc. as this is &quot;lashing out at users&quot;? No one argues, but many screaming and one have to accept it. 

In the German WP the users argue, exchanging opinions, naming mistakes, showing ways of solutions. And when someones starts to getting vulgar, disrespectful and brazen against another user he's getting opposition with arguments, reasons and opinions and is not getting supported by a screaming mob, even if his opponent was wrong in intention or action. And a discussion is not closed so quickly without a mediation by other users or an admin.

The language barrier is low for me, as I only have sometimes problems with slang or dialect, or did I get it that wrong? Honestly, this strange experience does not make me very enthusiastic to support the english WP more than I did before.

Thank you for your message. This shows that you know the politics but that there are bad people, including admins, in wikipedia.

Can you fix the title? I ask because you are wise to BLP violations. The man was cleared by the appeals court today.  The conviction was wrong, according to the court.

== New spider in Tasmania ==

Hello there. I just happened to be browsing ANI and noticed your &quot;on a lighter note&quot;-mention of the new spider [[WP:ANI#Proposal for block on user St quadri|here]]. Quite coincidentally, I had stumbled on [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-22/new-spider-discovery-bush-blitz/5615440 this article] about it not even an hour earlier and had been considering writing an article about it myself but decided against it because I still have a long list of other articles that need creation, expansion or other help and while ''working'' on one more article wouldn't be a problem, drafting who-knows-how-many articles simultaneously wouldn't be the greatest idea. &lt;br /&gt;
However, if you intend to create the article (or have you already?) and would '''like''' some help here-and-there&amp;mdash;or just a second pair of eyes on it&amp;mdash;I'd happily help you. If it's not needed at the moment (no offense taken if such is the case), I'll probably come around to the article in a few months instead, when I've cleared the backlog on my personal &quot;to-do&quot; list(s). [[User:AddWittyNameHere|AddWittyNameHere]] ([[User talk:AddWittyNameHere|talk]]) 00:09, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
:Hello Piet AU. Sure, you can call me Add, or any other shorthand for my username that appeals to you. Mind you, I'd suggest against 'Name', that would probably end up a bit confusing if anyone ever reads our conversations (or if you refer to them. Imagine &quot;I was talking with this fellow editor, let's call her ''Name'', about Subject&quot;... yeah, bound to confuse some folks), but if you decide that's your preference, that would still be fine with me. Really, so long as I can gather you're talking to or about me, and the name (''Name'', perhaps? see what I meant about confusing? :P) isn't intended to be malicious, I'm not so picky about names.
:Ah, nice. It's a short stub, of course, but then again, there probably isn't that much to be said about it yet (though I do intend to go digging for sources for some additional information soon).  At least this one has been in the news, might help it avoid the perpetual stub state most species (well, most non-mammalian species, anyway) tend to end up in. 
:And yeah, us Dutchies have the occasionally annoying habit to switch to other languages (in particular, English, though most know some French and/or German as well) when we sense the other person is more comfortable expressing themselves in that language. Or, in case of Amsterdam... even if you're native Dutch, expect to be greeted in English when entering a shop half of the time or more. Makes sense with all the tourists ''and'' most Dutchies speaking English as well, of course.
:(By the way, do you prefer a response here on your talkpage or would you have liked it better if I responded on mine and dropped a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{tb}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on yours?) [[User:AddWittyNameHere|AddWittyNameHere]] ([[User talk:AddWittyNameHere|talk]]) 14:09, 26 July 2014 (UTC)

== WP:A7 and WP:G11 ==

Hello Shirt58,

On https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitaine_Train, you correctly indicated the probable violation of A7 and G11.

Concerning A7 (No indication of importance), how are we supposed to decide? Is it the number of references, users?

Concerning G11 (Unambiguous advertising or promotion), I fully agree. However, we may rephrase it once translated. What do you think?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jiehong|Jiehong]] ([[User talk:Jiehong|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jiehong|contribs]]) 13:54, 29 July 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Hello. I see that you've declined the page [[1980na/my sandbox]] being nominated for speedy deletion under G2 with the rationale that the page was a user sandbox. However, the page is at mainspace.

== Punjabi language by a user ==

Hi, that user has spoken extreme filth about me and User:Noq (I can read punjabi). I will request you to block him, or kindly inform me where to take my complaint. That user is refusing to listen. We are just requesting him to add sources. Also, that user is a long term sock puppet. --&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Kokonor&quot; color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Vigyani&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Vigyani|''talk'']]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Vigyani|ਯੋਗਦਾਨ]]&lt;/sup&gt;  12:28, 13 August 2014 (UTC)

===Brooklyn Museum Art School page deletion===

I am re-creating the page with the proper copyright citations and standards. I had added the information in before as a temporary placement to get the page up quickly. Will make sure everything is up to code this time. [[User:Tracield|Tracield]] ([[User talk:Tracield|talk]]) 16:43, 19 August 2014 (UTC)

Nothing fundamentally had changed - he had played in the Bosnian top league at the time of the AFD i.e. he ''still'' fails [[WP:NFOOTBALL]] and [[WP:GNG]]. In my eyes the G4 is fine. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 14:34, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

== Arthur Fields (photographer) ==

Thanks for the copyvio cleanup. However, it seems that the entire article is a collage of copy–paste from various journal articles. The copying is attributed but not from online sources, and I believe violate the rules nonetheless. Is simply removing a few kB of recent insertion enough? --&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff;border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;[[User:Ohconfucius|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000; background-color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ohc&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;[[User talk:Ohconfucius|&lt;sup&gt;''¡digame!''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:30, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

|style=&quot;vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;&quot; | You've deleted the article named Vandana (Kannada actress). I can't understand why that article is deleted again and again. Vandana is a celebrated Kannada Heroine during 1960s. Contents what i added are true to best of my knowledge. My humble request to you that please re-post that article. I can not able to create that article which is being deleted time and again. The article is helpful to those who want to know about forgotten heroine Vandana.

== Kaletony banned as sockpuppet ==

I'm curious re your comment on Kaletony's Talk page:

&quot;Welcome Kaletony! I'm sure you know all the rules already, so instead of blocking you straight away...&quot;:([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kaletony Diff]).

As a new user account, how did you know that Kaletony &quot;knew all the rules already&quot;?  Did you suspect Kaletony was a sock?  Do you have any information about any alternative accounts?  If so, please share at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Kaletony SPI].  Thanks.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 15:17, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

== Kaaba ==

Although the article is no longer protected, it's been protected in the past. Although Reddy is only a day old, I see 10 edits before starting on Kaaba - a number that makes me suspicious. I've given Reddy a 3RR warning. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 18:38, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

== Db-author ==

Thank you very much for deletion of [[User:Sharma Amit Pathankot/Amit sharma pathankot]]!  I managed to accidently recreate the page while trying to find out why its blue link didn't change to red.  Many apologies.  I've tagged it with {{tl|Db-author}}.  Should have purged my work page.  Obviously it's time for me to grab some zzz's.

I'm sorry. I'm absolutely not a bot. I'm ust a wiki-newbie, and I am not so good at English. Because English isn't my mother tongue. --[[User:Automaton wiki|Automaton wiki]] ([[User talk:Automaton wiki|talk]]) 10:28, 4 October 2014 (UTC)

== Yummypets ==
Hi, I contact you as you deleted the page 'Yummypets' I created a few days ago. Actually this follow the Show Hello Orange where its CEO,Stéphane Richard, talked twice about this brand. You can listen to its presentation : http://livetv.orange.com/fr/live-Orange-TV/show-hello/le-replay/le-replay-du-show-hello-2014 

Maybe the article was too short, but it is one of my first. Then I'd like to recreate the page and write something more complete about the brand and especially its connected collar that was mentionned during the Show Hello Orange.

Then, how can I recreate the page ?

Thanks for your time and advices.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:FlorianGr|FlorianGr]] ([[User talk:FlorianGr|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/FlorianGr|contribs]]) 13:02, 13 October 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly, your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 12:39, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
==  Proposed deletion of Anton Franz Nonfried ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Anton Franz Nonfried]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''No assertion why this individual is notable. Google Books returns one result.'''

While all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Anton Franz Nonfried|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; &lt;font face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;&quot;&gt;679&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:30, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

No, I haven't read it.  Can't say that I'm sorry about that either, as I remember the case quite well.  I'll ask around and see if anyone else I know has read it. [[User:Perry Middlemiss|Perry Middlemiss]] ([[User talk:Perry Middlemiss|talk]]) 21:24, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

I only reverted you because all I could see was an &quot;A&quot; - was that what you intended? &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Giano|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Giano&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;   [[User talk:Giano|'''(talk)''']] 12:38, 23 October 2014 (UTC)

== RfD: [[B-Double-O-T-Y]] ==

You speedied a redirect that was left over from a page move ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2014_August_20#.22B-Double-O-T-Y discussion here]) but the RfD notice is still posted on the new redirect. I would normally just remove the notice since there doesn't seem to be an active discussion but I thought in this case I would let you know instead, in case there's something I missed (like there is a discussion but the link points to the wrong place, or something). Cheers. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 17:38, 3 November 2014 (UTC)

== Deleted our page ==

Hi Shirt58,

Shirt58 have deleted User:Greenwood Letting &amp; Estate Agents.  so we can not log in, please can you explain to me the difference between our page and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SilverDoor  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.181.39.30|86.181.39.30]] ([[User talk:86.181.39.30|talk]]) 02:12, 4 November 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Football ==

Ha, I have done some good in the world. Yes, and this Saturday, 7 PM Central Time, is Alabama - LSU. That's always a good game, and our coach is the former LSU coach so there's plenty of hate to go around. If you can't get it where you are, {{U|Tiderolls}} can no doubt tell you where the play-by-play for this slugfest can be found. Cheers!

== Keep an eye on a user? ==

Hey, could you do me a favor? Can you help me keep an eye on [[User:IVillager]]? They're one of the accounts that created the page [[Arsh Bal]], which you ended up having to salt to prevent further re-creation. They're creating various pages that are NOTWEBHOST violations and/or somewhat spammy, and they've made at least one sockpuppet account to evade the current block on their account. I'm actually somewhat concerned that this is a sockpuppet of another account, though. In any case, this is mostly under control but I did want to have at least one other set of eyes on this since I'm mildly concerned that they might try to create a web of various similar facebook-esque pages.

:Hello! I would like to submit a request to have your feedback contributed to the ongoing discussion of the deletion of a page that was created earlier today. The discussion can be found at the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart|Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart deletion page]].

Hello! I do not agree on your recent edit on Mughal Rajput war (1558) (1578). Becuase I thought your edit was incorrect. 

Thanks!

Hello,

I am looking to get in contact to hopefully learn what I'm doing wrong. As you can probably guess I am trying to figure out what in my article is holding me back. If you get some time I'd love to hear your thoughts.

== Deletion of Urban Nerds Collective page ==

Hi Pete,

I understand the below to be the reason for this page deletion:

''03:13, 29 November 2014 Shirt58 (talk | contribs) deleted page Urban Nerds Collective (A7: No explanation of significance (real person/animal/organization/web content/organized event): No press, no independent online coverage - all just run-of-the-mill listings. No chance at all of passing WP:CORPDEPTH at WP:AfD)'''

I would like to request more time to work on this article to make necessary amendments and to bring it in line with all Wikipedia regulations.

The page is not intended to be promotional. The aim of this page is to document a movement that has emerged out of an underground music scene in London over the past 8 years. Urban Nerds Collective is of significance as it is the first agency in the UK to have grown from this type of cultural movement.

The page includes a number of independent online sources (Mixmag, Huffington Post), not 'run-of-the-mill listings', as claimed. I have further evidence of this (Timeout, British Library, Kiss FM, Dazed digital) which I can add to the page if my request is allowed.

==  Proposed deletion of Cotswolds big cat ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Cotswolds big cat]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''This has had coverage, but of a [[WP:1E]] type, doesn't appear to meet [[WP:NOTABILITY]] / [[WP:GNG]]. No incoming links (if I had found an article covering issues like this, I would have suggested a merge).'''

While all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Cotswolds big cat|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 06:53, 11 December 2014 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

I think that the tags you put on [[Blue Mass]] are somewhat contradictory. Both original research and primary sources? I also fail to see how the current text could support any more references.

== Why my page been Delete ? ==

I Just create real organization page of my school there no fake only unoffially can you recreate that Shirt58   &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Timz42|Timz42]] ([[User talk:Timz42|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Timz42|contribs]]) 09:43, 1 January 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
*[[User:Timz42|Timz42]], I've answered this over at [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion#Bodindecha_Intelligence_Agency]], but I'll repeat some of that here: the organization may exist, but that doesn't mean it is notable. I also want to again warn you that trying to uncover illegal activities on your own can put you in a '''''LOT''''' of personal danger and unlike video games, movies, or comic books, you can't put them down once you're done. Trying to run an unofficial crime fighting organization in your school (which is what this essentially is) will put not only yourself at risk, but also the people around you and can also reflect poorly on your school since you have named your group after the school. (Since if you do something that itself breaks the rules or can be seen as harassment, that will reflect upon the school.) I'm not saying that you shouldn't work towards justice, just that I'd recommend that you work with the local police and the school in ways that will be seen as more productive and safe for yourself. I know I sound like a nagging mother, but you have no idea how badly this can turn out if it ends up that you make an enemy of someone who wants to beat you (or someone else) or if you end up accusing someone of illegal activities without any actual evidence (or someone who wasn't actually doing anything wrong at all, which would be seen as harassment).

*[[User:Timz42|Timz42]], even if there is no danger (replying to his message on the article's talk page) there is still the issue of notability- which has not been established.

Hi Shirt,
I'm trying to create a page for company and i have followed some of wiki instructions. somewhere i missed up.

'''Steps I did it:'''
1. Properly i created a page.
2. I tried to change my page heading as Capitals after im saving i got warning message.
3. Then i tried to click on the &quot;cancel button&quot; on the edit page. Again i got speedy error message.
4. I tried to edit page and delete the first content line which is newly added after i got error message {{db some content line}}. then i saved the page its working fine.

Suddenly i got message '''&quot;page has deleted&quot;''' from you. Im little confused. I want to create a same page. What i do to next.

Can you please role back my page URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VThink_Technologies? or
is their any issues for me to create a same page again?

== Your RfA question ==

I saw your question on Titodutta's RfA and assumed it was a real example. As a consequence, I did [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yellowknifer&amp;diff=642318950&amp;oldid=593635508 this]. Still, going from 0 to 4 sources in afternoon is a job worth doing, I guess.

== My RFA and two points ==

Hello,&lt;br/&gt;
I came to talk on one thing, and now I have two things to tell you. First) the non-important point: your talk page is too long. Slow internet users like me face difficulties to open such pages. Could you archive older messages? (it is just a personal request) Second) I can understand both Andrew's comment and the people who replied to it. Please see [[Wikipedia_talk:Noticeboard_for_India-related_topics/Archive_54#2013_Bangladesh_India_WikiProjects_dispute_resolution|this attempt]]. There I did not argue for India, nor I supported those Indian proposals too. I just told them that &quot;these are the problems&quot;. Please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ALokenath_Brahmachari&amp;diff=479433765&amp;oldid=472183539 this move] or my &quot;oppose&quot; vote at [[Talk:Kripalu_Maharaj#Revert_name_change|here]]. It is almost the same thing what he is talking about. I generally do not move an article directly, and try to take community opinion first using [[WP:RM]] process. I have started &quot;requested move&quot; discussion &lt;u&gt;many times&lt;/U&gt; only because I felt that those articles had honorific titles. It is the same thing what they are suggesting.&lt;br/&gt;Before starting this RFA, I had a resolution, that I'll allow oppose voters to talk, and try my best to avoid debates and personal attacks. Let them express their views (eg. Titodutta is the worst guy of the entire Wikipedia), and let people reply to it too. That is the beauty of Wikipedia. Regards. --&lt;span style=&quot;background:orange;border:orange ridge&quot;&gt;[[User:Titodutta|Tito]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;background:white;otit;border-bottom-style:ridge;&quot;&gt;☸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#57C738;border:green ridge&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Titodutta|Dutta]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:47, 14 January 2015 (UTC)&lt;br/&gt;(PS. to you only, I'll not write it on that RFA page so that people think I am trying to gather sympathy. My two relatives (grandmother and maternal aunt) are hospitalized at the same time, that's the reason it took me a long time to reply to your question) --&lt;span style=&quot;background:orange;border:orange ridge&quot;&gt;[[User:Titodutta|Tito]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;background:white;otit;border-bottom-style:ridge;&quot;&gt;☸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#57C738;border:green ridge&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Titodutta|Dutta]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:47, 14 January 2015 (UTC)

== Your intervention under Q14 ==

Shirt58, I take very strong exception to that. If you want to clarify Q11, you should do so under Q11, not under Q14. In Q14, I addressed a question to Tito, not to you, and his reply is his, not yours, to clarify if he wishes. Your intervention is out of place there. It's telling people what to think, it's partisan, and you've placed it where it is difficult to reply to it without disrupting the RfA by turning the questions '''for the candidate''' into a free discussion for all. I have reverted it. Put it in a more appropriate place if you want, but not there. --[[User:Stfg|Stfg]] ([[User talk:Stfg|talk]]) 13:26, 16 January 2015 (UTC)

== lazord00d hater community ==

As a married father with a job and a life,  I don't have time for whatever you are referring to even if i did care enough to be a part of it. It's clear to me that a subset of Wikipedia editors dictate what happens on Wikipedia,  regardless of the supposed fact that this editing is open to the public. I've already defended my images and position numerous times,  the strategy here is to wear me down, but only if I let it. You can pass this on to whatever complaint thread you speak of or not. I really don't care at this point. Regardless thanks for the heads up.

==Re: 2065 in Australia==
The reason is a little bit ridiculous/weird. I have found that [[22nd century]], [[23rd century]], even [[24th century]] can be created. Therefore, I thought it is OK to create a page for 2065 in Australia. I made the redirect, because I currently don't have time to write sth in this page --[[User:Coekon|Coekon]] ([[User talk:Coekon|talk]]) 11:56, 17 January 2015 (UTC)

As you thanked me for staring the ANI on the disruptive editor, any input there would be appreciated.--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 17:24, 18 January 2015 (UTC)

== Uncategorized tags ==

I do add categories to an uncategorized article instead of the maintenance tag sometimes — the operative distinction being that I do so when, because of familiarity with the topic and/or the particular subject area in question, I already know what the appropriate categories are, whether the categories in question actually exist or not, and on and so forth. But for various technical reasons that have prevented Wikipedia from being able to stay on top of the untagged uncategorized articles as promptly as needed for several weeks now, I was (and still am) working with a batch of almost ''2,000'' uncategorized articles — and it's not realistic to expect one person to be able to directly categorize over 2,000 articles by hand (it's not a task that can be done in AWB.) And par for the course on Wikipedia is that another 100 or so new uncategorized articles get created ''every day'', meaning that the list is ''never'' actually clean for more than 24 hours — by the time I actually get through the nearly 1,000 articles that are still there as of right now, there will be ''another'' 400-500 new ones on top of that, and on and so forth. 

That's why the categorization project exists as a maintenance queue that a ''lot'' of people work on: so that it's not all falling on one single person to manually categorize 2,000+ articles at once. And because that project exists, expecting an editor to ''bypass'' it by immediately manually categorizing every untagged uncategorized page that exists is both unrealistic and unfair. That's precisely why the project exists: so that as many people as possible are getting the work done. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 18:42, 18 January 2015 (UTC)

: No worries. Trust me, you're not the first person who's ever wondered or asked — I've even occasionally had to contend with people labelling the categorization tagging as outright ''disruptive'', as if it were somehow any more &quot;disruptive&quot; than any other maintenance tag that Wikipedia uses.

== KuhnstylePro salt ==

Hi Shirt58, [[Tattle Cartoon!]] is the solution the banned sock operator KuhnstylePro created as a workaround to the [[Phibian Mike]] salt that I recently requested at ANI (and that you were kind enough to perform). I'm sure that it'll get taken care of through normal channels, I figured I'd mention it to help another admin understand the scope of this kid's disruptions. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 04:23, 20 January 2015 (UTC)

== Warning understood ==

Hi Shirt, your warning is understood 100%. In retrospect, it was a childish statement. I understand the importance of protecting the kids. My comment was made in the interest of protecting the project from disruption. Shan't happen again and I have not divulged any of this information to anybody, nor will I. Thanks for the correction and I apologize for my stupid comment. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 13:29, 21 January 2015 (UTC)

== HELP PLEASE==
Hi Shirt 58, I created a page of a Telugu actor and it has been deleted for not having the right reference.  How do I know if it's a right reference.  He has an article of him in a magazine.  Is that good enough and if it is how can I retrieve the page and start over .
http://jhpublicschool.com/wp-content/hillside/hill-side-news-10-102014.pdf 

It is on page 13.

Hello Shirt58. It has been over six months since you last edited your [[WP:AFC]] draft article submission, entitled &quot;[[Draft:Frederick Jackson (singer)|Frederick Jackson]]&quot;. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|Draft:Frederick Jackson (singer)|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note that Articles for Creation is not for indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia [[WP:mainspace|mainspace]].

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, you can request its undeletion by one of two methods (don't do both): 1) follow the instructions at [[WP:REFUND/G13]], ''or'' 2) copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Draft:Frederick Jackson (singer)&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, and click &quot;Save page&quot;. An administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt;  ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 22:23, 26 January 2015 (UTC)

== Samir Becic (subject of a delete in 2012. Has literally 50 sources independent of him in major US and German newspapers and fitness trade journals) ==

Hi Shirt58,

In short, Kino is wrong about Samir Becic in 2015. He was correct to delete in 2012 due to non-notable. But I'm no idiot putting this page up, and you weren't a fool and neither was APC to move it.

Please lobby to get this thing live. I put it in AFC. I left this note below for Kino. I found the &quot;let me delete rapidly because it's some &quot;SPA&quot;&quot; to be so so rash. There are literally 50 or so sources that are third party, indepedent journalist, clear editorial oversight-- some of which SB is directly the subject of the article-- that have been published in the EU and US since 2012. Thanks.

[[Special:Contributions/2601:E:280:1C00:4D5E:4F3A:560A:36D9|2601:E:280:1C00:4D5E:4F3A:560A:36D9]] ([[User talk:2601:E:280:1C00:4D5E:4F3A:560A:36D9|talk]]) 02:12, 29 January 2015 (UTC)
Kino,

I am politely requesting that you review the Samir Becic article at AFC and bring it live. You correctly deleted in 2012. However, literally 50 different new sources are avialable on him from LAT, WashT, and german pubs.

I get it. Some people are legit and not legit. Some people are &quot;Too Early.&quot; But this warrants a review. I'm a fellow Ivy Leaguer-- no I didn't go to Yale-- but you're not working with an idiot here. I'm a lot more like you than the rest of the general public. Thanks for handling.2601:E:280:1C00:4D5E:4F3A:560A:36D9 (talk) 01:58, 29 January 2015 (UTC)

==Template:1950s-Kannada-film-stub==
Hello, I don't understand 'fix articles first' for the request of speedy deletion for the above template. I have created the template for organizing stub articles and per Wiki if the articles are less than 60 then there may not be a category required. So I have requested the Category for deletion and it got deleted. So the template is the last thing to delete.

==Disambiguation link notification for February 5==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Joan Schmidt (cricketer)]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Victoria]] ([http://dispenser.homenet.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Joan_Schmidt_%28cricketer%29 check to confirm]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[http://dispenser.homenet.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Joan_Schmidt_%28cricketer%29 fix with Dab solver]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

The page 2016 Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament is not necessary because there is a page Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics which shows the information. It is duplicate. [[User:Noncommittalp|Noncommittalp]] ([[User talk:Noncommittalp|talk]]) 11:49, 15 February 2015 (UTC)

== The help you requested... ==
I am willing to help. So the Korean translation, here it is.
*『일성록(日省錄)』Llseongnok --&gt; '''Il Seong Nok''' ''(Capital 'i' wasn't lowercase 'L', so probably you got confused there...haha. And also, 'nok', 'rok'...I'm not too sure, but since mostly they use 'nok' as the pronunciation for the letter '록', I left it that way)''
*『용호한록(龍湖閒錄)』Yonghohanrok --&gt; '''Yong Ho Han Nok''' ''(Again, with the 'nok' 'rok' situation...my recommendation, your choice)''
*『동문휘고(同文彙考)』'''Dongmunwhigo (Dong Mun Whi Go)''' ''(Correct!)''
*『하거집(荷居集)』Hageoujip --&gt; '''Ha Geo Jip''' ''(I don't know how it is in Australia, but here in California, Korean-American communities do not necessarily put 'u' when they pronounce '거'.)''
*『淸季中日韓關係史料』--&gt; '''청계중일한관계사료 (Chung Ge Jung Il Han Gwan Ge Sa Ryo)'''
*『籌辨夷務始末』--&gt; '''주변이무시말 (Ju Byun I Mu Shi Mal)''' ''Honestly, I don't know what this is, but it sounds strange...''

Anything else, you could ask me.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 14:42, 23 February 2015 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for February 24==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[June James (cricketer)]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[South Perth]] ([http://dispenser.homenet.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/June_James_%28cricketer%29 check to confirm]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[http://dispenser.homenet.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/June_James_%28cricketer%29 fix with Dab solver]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 09:03, 24 February 2015 (UTC)

==Excuse me, why did you delete my page?==
Hello Shirt58, 
I am a new editor of Wikipedia.  However, I am not sure if the page ''' Advanced Rocket Research Center''' has any problem.  Could you please tell me what is the problem and how can I improve it?

THX! [[User:Willy81234|Willy81234]] ([[User talk:Willy81234|talk]]) 11:48, 26 February 2015 (UTC)

== Deletion of article on Rajesh Bhola ==

Dear Sir, A strong protest is herewith lodged against the morality principles of Wikipedia.  It had been indeed very shocking to see that suddenly the said article which was published by Wikipedia (through submission of the same in Articles for Creation AFC and not created by my own self) after due course of discussions / verifications of references and links etc has been deleted without assigning plausible / tangible reasons after 9 months of its creation on 6 July 2014. Though I am a regular duly logged in contributor to Wikipedia and has made certain quality contributions in growth of Wikipedia by submitting articles / modification from time to time, the said arbitrary and erratic deletion has pained me immensely. 
I have been informed that “This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time.”
The reason / argument given is false and misleading. The person about whom the article is published is notable as per your rules. The notability is duly established by way of attachment of number of references which are authentic sources for making the subject notable. The submissions made by me were duly accepted by you and hence the article was published by you under AFC and not directly by myself. The notability of the subject is duly established by way of his contributions to the most esteemed newspapers and periodicals of India. He has made more than 200 contributions to such papers and periodicals apart from being founder of Spastic Society of Gurgaon where more than thousands of children afflicted with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities are being taken care of and a page is duly published by you on the same after due acknowledgement of the notability of that subject.
 It is unethical to delete a page which is published by you in AFC after taking due cognizance of all the aspects and criteria of notability and genuineness of the subject until something to the contrary is found or reported! How can an article published by you 9 months back be suddenly deleted with the above reason when due debate was held and the article was published by your official in AFC after due submission of article by me.
I request you to immediately undelete the article for the creation of which due process of compliance of Wikipedia criteria and policies has already been done. Let your readers, who are spread in all the nooks and corners of this planet, retain trust in your policies which should not sound arbitrary at any stage of evolution of Wikipedia.

==[[Ella Orr Campbell]] - a possible &quot;WP:DYK&quot;?==
Hi Peter, I'm Ambrosia. Thanks for your welcoming comment on my talk page. It's taken a few attempts for me to get my head around editing wikipedia, writing articles and doing edits but I'm gradually getting there. I'm still very much a newbie at dealing with most of the bureaucracy as well as a LOT of the markup. So much so I'm even having to go away and research what a DYK article is.  However I am very happy to raise the profile of women scientists and particular Dr Campbell. Would I have to do anything to assist the process? Yours in ignorance (until I read what I'm sure is a massive amount of Wikipedia documentation on DYK articles) [[User:Ambrosia10|Ambrosia10]] ([[User talk:Ambrosia10|talk]]) 16:51, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

== I did not create a page article Alonda Shevette ==

Hello, I would like to know why my name is on this site other than than my page. This is false information linked to my name, my name is Alonda Shevette and I would like all other pages to be remove. I am in fact the only Alonda Shevette you will find online and I did not create or give permission to anyone else to create a page for me. This is misrepresentation of my name and could cause harm to my career opportunities. Thanks!

We edit conflicted while I was doing my own trim on the article. I wasn't leaning towards removing ''quite'' that much, at least not before I'd looked properly for sources, but starting from the ground up isn't a bad plan either.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

== Something went wrong with two page moves ==

Hi, recently I requested moves for two pages: [[Peperoncini]] to [[Peperoncino]] and [[Italian sweet pepper]] to [[Friggitello]]. However, judging from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friggitello&amp;action=history revision history] something went wrong: Peperoncini was moved to Friggitello and the move of Italian sweet pepper to Friggitello thus did not occur. Could you please fix this? To clarify, based on the current situation: Friggitello should move to Peperoncino and Italian sweet pepper to Friggitello. Thanks for taking action so quickly though. --[[User:AlexanderVanLoon|AlexanderVanLoon]] ([[User talk:AlexanderVanLoon|talk]]) 14:51, 25 March 2015 (UTC)

== RE Cambrdige BioMarketing ==

Hi Shirt,

Please could you elaborate on why you deleted the wiki page I created Cambridge BioMarketing? You have stated &quot;Advertising&quot; but the page is independently created and of a neutral view, I have no connection to them. The page was automatically flagged up for speedy deletion because it has the word &quot;marketing&quot; in it which I think is unfair, as this is actually the company name. thank you  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.6.130.178|82.6.130.178]] ([[User talk:82.6.130.178|talk]]) 10:12, 27 March 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

==A Call To Action==
Dear Shirt58,

I created the page A Call To Action today, and am surprised that you added an advert tag to it.  I'm very happy to alter the tone, but I'm struggling a bit to see what you find to be a problem.  The topic, I recognise, is capable of being seen as controversial, and I have tried quite hard to be objective.  Could you explain a bit more where you see material &quot;like an advertisement&quot; or &quot;promotional content&quot; or &quot;inappropriate external links&quot; or content not &quot;written from a neutral point of view&quot;?

Looking forward to your help,

[[User:Deipnosophista|Deipnosophista]] ([[User talk:Deipnosophista|talk]]) 20:17, 18 April 2015 (UTC)

== Retrieving deleted submission ==

Hi Peter, I am trying to retrieve the article for Beverly Hills Sports Council that you deleted to revise and re-submit but have not had any success. Can you help? [[User:Nyfan2007|Nyfan2007]] ([[User talk:Nyfan2007|talk]]) 21:01, 23 April 2015 (UTC)
:Peter thank you for your offer to help. Still pretty inexperienced in wiki. Can you send me an email? [[User:Nyfan2007|Nyfan2007]] ([[User talk:Nyfan2007|talk]]) 18:39, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
::Hi Peter I have made many changes to this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Beverly_Hills_Sports_Council revised draft].

== Annoyed ==
From a recent incomprehensible email, I gather that you are annoyed with me but I simply cannot imagine why. Please explain. There is a limit to edit summary length and with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AA.K.Karthikeyan%2Fsandbox&amp;diff=658978135&amp;oldid=658975733 this edit] you clearly exceeded that length. You obviously have some useful ideas about this topic so could you please put your complete message on to [[User talk:A.K.Karthikeyan/sandbox]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:RHaworth|RHaworth]] ([[User talk:RHaworth|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/RHaworth|contribs]]) 16:02, 24 April 2015 (UTC)

== AdvaCare Pharma Draft corrections ==
I've recently been told that the tone of my article is promotional, or that it uses some promotional words. Can you please show me what exactly is promotional so I can change it? As far as I can see it is all factual!--[[User:RedBud|RedBud]] ([[User talk:RedBud|talk]]) 08:31, 27 April 2015 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

Fine with me, Pete. It was such an obvious copyright violation that it didn't occur to me to do anything other than zap it. You're a better person...

== [[Gary Williams]] ==

Moving [[Gary Williams]] away doesn't seem like a great idea.  (For one thing, there are a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Gary_Williams&amp;limit=500 boatload of links to the page] that need to be fixed.)  I looked at [http://stats.grok.se/ traffic statistics] for each article.  [[Gary Anthony Williams]] blows all of them away, but he seems to actually go by &quot;Gary Anthony Williams&quot;, so he's not in contention for the [[Gary Williams]] title anyway.  After him, the basketball coach beats any of the others by 10:1 or so.  So the basketball coach seems to be the overwhelmingly primary topic.  From Google hits (which aren't great), [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&amp;q=%22Gary+Williams%22+football+-Maryland+-NFL+-wikipedia &quot;Gary Williams&quot; football -Maryland -NFL -wikipedia] gets 42K g-hits (and none of these are even relevant, at least in the US - theses are all American football players named Gary Williams).  [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&amp;q=%22Gary+Williams%22+soccer+-Maryland+-NFL+-wikipedia &quot;Gary Williams&quot; soccer -Maryland -NFL -wikipedia] gets 15K.  [&quot;Gary Williams&quot; footballer -Maryland -NFL -wikipedia] gets 9K. [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&amp;q=%22Gary+Williams%22+UK+football++-wikipedia &quot;Gary Williams&quot; UK football -wikipedia] gets 24K.  (Obviously, I'm searching from the US, so Google treats &quot;football&quot; different here than it does from a UK search, but it's what I have available.)  [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&amp;q=%22Gary+Williams%22+basketball+-wikipedia &quot;Gary Williams&quot; basketball -wikipedia] gets 129K hits.  The basketball coach seems to be clearly the primary topic and I don't think this move was a good idea.  --[[User:B|B]] ([[User talk:B|talk]]) 12:34, 18 May 2015 (UTC)

== Cedric Thompson ==

You deleted the wrong Cedric Thompson. [[Cedric Thompson (defensive back)]] was a different Cedric Thompson. I moved him to &quot;Cedric Thompson&quot; after the first Cedric Thompson was deleted.[[User:Joeykai|Joeykai]] ([[User talk:Joeykai|talk]]) 10:34, 19 May 2015 (UTC)
:{{ping|Shirt58}}The Cedric Thompson that [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cedric Thompson]] refers to is not the Cedric Thompson that you deleted. If you think that the Cedric Thompson who has yet to play a game for the Miami Dolphins isn't notable, then restore his article and nominate him for deletion because there was never a deletion discussion about that Cedric Thompson.[[User:Joeykai|Joeykai]] ([[User talk:Joeykai|talk]]) 13:16, 19 May 2015 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 14:07, 19 May 2015 (UTC)

== Cedric Thompson ==

You deleted the wrong [[Cedric Thompson]]. [[Cedric Thompson (defensive back)]] (who is notable) was moved to the location after the original was deleted after the AFD. This is now oddly the second time this has happened.--[[User:Yankees10|Yankees10]] 16:43, 19 May 2015 (UTC)

== Expressway ==

Hi dear Shirt58.

I candidated the article because it is not subject of [[Wikipedia:Notability (geographic features)#Roadways|this subpage]]. It is a municipal way completely inside the city! And not a provincial or state way. This condition exists for similar pages in [[Template:Expressways of Esfahan|this template]] too. Thanks for your attention.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].

You are receiving this message because a technical change may affect a bot, gadget, or user script you have been using.  The breaking change involves API calls.  This change has been planned for two years.  The WMF will start making this change on '''30 June 2015'''.  A partial list of affected bots can be seen here:  https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/081931.html  This includes all bots that are using pywikibot compat.  Some of these bots have already been fixed.  However, if you write user scripts or operate a bot that uses the [[:mw:API|API]], then you should check your code, to make sure that it will not break.

What, exactly, is breaking? The &quot;default continuation mode&quot; for action=query requests to api.php will be changing to be easier for new coders to use correctly.  To find out whether your script or bot may be affected, then search the source code (including any frameworks or libraries) for the string &quot;query-continue&quot;.  If that is not present, then the script or bot is ''not'' affected.  In a few cases, the code will be present but not used.  In that case, the script or bot will continue working.

This change will be part of 1.26wmf12.  It will be deployed to test wikis (including mediawiki.org) on 30 June, to non-Wikipedias (such as Wiktionary) on 1 July, and to all Wikipedias on 2 July 2015.

If your bot or script is receiving the warning about this upcoming change (as seen at https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;list=allpages ), it's time to fix your code!

* The simple solution is to simply include the &quot;rawcontinue&quot; parameter with your request to continue receiving the raw continuation data (example &lt;https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;list=allpages&amp;rawcontinue=1&gt;). No other code changes should be necessary.
* Or you could update your code to use the simplified continuation  documented at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Query#Continuing_queries (example &lt;https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;list=allpages&amp;continue=&gt;), which is much easier for clients to implement correctly.

Either of the above solutions may be tested immediately, you'll know it works because you stop seeing the warning.

Do you need help with your own bot or script?  Ask questions in e-mail on the [[mail:mediawiki-api|mediawiki-api]] or [[mail:wikitech-l|wikitech-l]] mailing lists.  Volunteers at [[:m:Tech]] or [[:w:en:WP:Village pump (technical)]] or [[:w:en:Wikipedia:Bot owners' noticeboard]] may also be able to help you.

Are you using someone else's gadgets or user scripts?  Most scripts are not affected.  To find out if a script you use needs to be updated, then post a note at the discussion page for the gadget or the talk page of the user who originally made the script.

==Waterside Workers Federation==

Thanks for salvaging the Waterside Workers' Union mess, but I'm afraid you've created another one. The history of trade unions is pretty confusing at the best of times, but ATUA takes an approach that I don't think makes a lot of sense for Wikipedia even though they're a good source otherwise.

For example, as they note, the Waterside Workers Federation was founded as a national organisation in 1902: the 1907 date only refers when they attained federal registration as a union, at which point they'd been in existence for five years, and at a time when registration under federal industrial relations law was far less important than it is today. A similar situation occurs in 1991: functionally, the WWF absorbed another union and continued on as it was, but ATUA treats this as creating an entirely separate union because of the quirks of industrial relations law.

There was only one organisation called the WWF from 1902 to 1993, and it makes no sense either have two articles on it or to have the article at (1907-1991) when it was neither founded in 1907 nor ended in 1991.

Also, any chance you could archive your talk page? It's absolute hell to load on an old computer, and as I saw while I was waiting for the page to load I'm clearly not the first person to ask.

== Shirt58's starter for 10 ==

That's the rather cryptic title of a section on the Language ref desk. The &quot;for 10&quot; sounds like a ''Jeopardy!'' entry. But would you have a clue what the &quot;Shirt58's starter&quot; would mean? Thank you. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] &lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 20:42, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

== CSD of [[Teruaki Ogawa]] ==

Just to clarify that situation, the CSD template was placed just after the creation of the page, while it consisted of only the page title and little else. It appears that the page creator then expanded the article, but did not remove the CSD template because one is not allowed to do so on self-created content.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 13:15, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thanks for trying to help me by leaving a message at my Talk page. How did you find me on Wikipedia? Did you check one of my edits or contributions? &lt;br/&gt;

==Vabantar==
Hi, I noticed you have deleted the page [[Vabantar]]. However, the user has recreated this page. [[User:Ayub407|Ayub407]] ([[User talk:Ayub407|talk]]) 16:24, 4 August 2015 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Yogesh Chauhan (2nd nomination)]] ==

Hi there, I've just closed the above AfD because it appears to be a duplicate of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Yogesh Chauhan]] (simultaneous edit, saved two minutes after the first). Since the original has more comments, would you mind adding your !vote to the former. [[User:Fuebaey|Fuebaey]] ([[User talk:Fuebaey|talk]]) 17:14, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Adam Levy (Actor)]]==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello Shirt58. Thanks for patrolling new pages – it's a very important task! I'm just letting  you know, however, that you shouldn't tag pages as lacking context ([[WP:CSD#A1|CSD A1]]), content ([[WP:CSD#A3|CSD A3]]),or significance ([[WP:CSD#A7|CSD A7]]) moments after they are created{{#if:Adam Levy (Actor)|, as you did at [[:Adam Levy (Actor)]]}}. It's best to wait ''at least'' 10–15 minutes for more content to be added if the page is very short, and the articles should ''not'' be marked as [[Wikipedia:New pages patrol/patrolled pages|patrolled]].  Tagging such pages in a very short space of time may [[WP:BITE|drive away well-meaning contributors]], which is not good for Wikipedia. Attack pages ([[WP:CSD#G10|G10]]), blatant nonsense ([[WP:CSD#G1|G1]]), copyright violations ([[WP:CSD#G12|G12]]) and pure vandalism/blatant hoaxes ([[WP:CSD#G3|G3]]) should of course be tagged and deleted immediately. Thanks.{{Z149}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-hasty --&gt; [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|The Big Bad Wolfowitz (aka Hullaballoo)]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 16:06, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

== Notability ==

Why would you question the notability of an article you created yourself? I like that we both thought an obscure person deserved recognition. --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|talk]]) 18:22, 8 August 2015 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].  Regards from [[User:Nettrom|Nettrom]] ([[User talk:Nettrom|talk]]), SuggestBot's caretaker. -- [[User:SuggestBot|SuggestBot]] ([[User talk:SuggestBot|talk]]) 13:22, 25 August 2015 (UTC)

== Gomis ==

Hi there! I think you may be over-conscientious here - [[Template:Translated_page]] suggests the template only be used where the article has &quot;content imported into the English Wikipedia from a non-English-language Wikipedia&quot;. I think that due to my interference there is very little left of your original translation (except a couple of references). Thank you for adding the article anyway - as you might gather, it had been in the back of my mind for a while to do something about Gomis. Best, --[[User:Smerus|Smerus]] ([[User talk:Smerus|talk]]) 12:04, 28 August 2015 (UTC)

== Passing the bar ==

It's not slang or shorthand.  See [http://iancpilarczyk.com/the-origins-of-passing-the-bar/ here].  Thank you for your edits.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 10:58, 30 August 2015 (UTC)

== Articles you might like to edit, from SuggestBot ==
''Note:'' All columns in this table are sortable, allowing you to rearrange the table so the articles most interesting to you are shown at the top.  All images have mouse-over popups with more information.  For more information about the columns and categories, please [[User:SuggestBot/Documentation/Suggestion columns|consult the documentation]] and please get in touch on [[User talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]] with any questions you might have.

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

If you have feedback on how to make SuggestBot better, please let us know on [[User_talk:SuggestBot|SuggestBot's talk page]].
