[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Local government]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by an [[automated]] [[computer program]] called [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG makes very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|mistakes]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been considered as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|901102}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
*'''If you need help''', please see our '''[[Help:Contents|help pages]]''', and if you can't find what you are looking for there, please feel free to place &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on [[Special:MyTalk|your talk page]] and someone will drop by to help.
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Local government]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Local+government&amp;diff=478081895&amp;oldid=478081792 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/205.174.114.34|205.174.114.34]] [[User:205.174.114.34|(u)]] [[User talk:205.174.114.34|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.976435 on 2012-02-21T15:46:36+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 901102 --&gt;.

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:James086|James086]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/205.174.114.34|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Suspension bridge]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:James086|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#454545&quot;&gt;[[User:James086|James086]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:James086|&lt;font color=&quot;#006400&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:44, 3 December 2012 (UTC)
