i have a question... i entered in a bunch of stats and put the links where i got them but can't figure out how to make them show up like the 1 &amp; 2 in a reference list at the bottom rather than throughout the page? thanks!  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shawnaleabrown|Shawnaleabrown]] ([[User talk:Shawnaleabrown|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shawnaleabrown|contribs]]) 20:54, 3 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== AfDs, Erpert and ANI ==

I'm wondering it would be best to quickly remove the ANI discussion since I already reverted the AfDs... to lessen the potential for drama... &lt;font face=&quot;Comic sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:Paul Erik|Paul Erik]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Paul Erik|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Paul Erik|(contribs)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 18:59, 6 January 2011 (UTC)

::GiantSnowman, I see that you are assuming good faith now per [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Erpert.27s_use_of_NAC this], and that's fine, but I feel I still need to clarify something. It appears the reason that thread was started at all is because you think I closed the second AfD and then alerted people to the first one due to it being &quot;mine&quot;. That was definitely ''not'' the case; as I stated, it was because both AfDs concerned articles by the same editor ''with the exact same problems.'' And very rarely have I defected one AfD to another simply because I started one of them; see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Krem_Cauldron here], for example (and not one user complained about that). But I'm willing to let it go if you are.

Hi, I moved back the page to Yusef Ahmed, I almost understand Arabic and Qatari commentators always call him Yusef Ahmed, he wrote '''Y.

I deleted the cat, but was slightly surprised that you aren't an admin and couldn't do it yourself. Ever thought about running for adminship? You're a veteran who knows the place inside out, with a bajillion edits and articles created. You're one of the most active WPF people when it comes to AfD, so you're well versed on the project side of things. I'd be more than happy to nominate you.

== Your RfA ==

Hello, GiantSnowman (by the way, I love your user name). RfA can be a very cruel and unpleasant experience, as I know from having gone through it myself. Even civil, reasonable &quot;oppose&quot; comments can feel like personal attacks, and for this reason I am sorry to have contributed to the opposition to your RfA. However, I was 100% sincere when I wrote that I think you are a very good contributor, but your talents are better suited to writing than to administering. I am different: the amount of new content I have written is tiny compared to your contributions, and I feel I am less useful as a writer than you are, but I hope that my admin contributions make up to some extent for my limitations in that area. (That is not to say that I am in any way ashamed of my writing contributions, only that there are much less of them than in your case.) Administration is not in any sense &quot;better&quot; than writing content: it is just a different contribution. Maybe you will make a good admin one day when you have learnt a bit more about the relevant issues, but even if you never become an admin your contributions are of just as much value as those of many people who do become admins. One other point: even though I am one of those who have opposed, I would like to remind you that there are substantially more &quot;supports&quot; than &quot;opposes&quot;, so clearly there is a good deal of appreciation of your work. [[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]] ([[User talk:JamesBWatson|talk]]) 21:55, 15 January 2011 (UTC)
:Many thanks for the message, it's much appreciated. I'll admit I have been disheartened by the opposition comments, which to seen to concentrate on just one or two (admittedly poor) answers to questions, and which ignore both my positive contributions to Wikipedia, as well as my ''responses'' to said questions. However, I am well aware that becoming an admin is a serious business, and regardless of the outcome of the RfA will definitely spend much more time learning about the relevant issues. And as you have said, there ''are'' currently more &quot;supports&quot; than &quot;opposes&quot;, so other editors are able to see my net positive. Thanks again for your message and your RfA comments. Warm regards, [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 11:43, 16 January 2011 (UTC)
::I have to say I'm disappointed with how few of the opposes are actually based on anything in your contrib history. Its a fair while since I've nominated anyone for RFA, and I can say without doubt that in the intervening time it has become far harder to pass. Between 2006 and 2009 I nominated seven people. Six of them passed without a single oppose. Seven if you count my own RFA on top. One failed, but it was their second RFA, which tend to be a bit different (that person became an admin following a third RFA a few months later). I can say with confidence that you are in the same bracket of trustworthiness and ability as any of those others I nominated. If you had been nominated in that environment, you'd have breezed through. If the RFA crowd have hardened their attitudes over time, then frankly it is their loss, and the project's. [[User:Oldelpaso|Oldelpaso]] ([[User talk:Oldelpaso|talk]]) 21:54, 16 January 2011 (UTC)
*It seems your RFA is going to [[WP:SNOW|snow]]; you only have 61% supports, and given that you already have 25 opposes, you need an additional 29 supports to even have a chance of succeeding the RFA.

I don't think any type of &quot;consensus&quot; was reached at WP:CAT. I know it was listed for a fairly long time, but, as I showed you, it is the long term consensus '''not''' to include a category and its sub-category.--[[User:Namiba|TM]] 14:23, 17 January 2011 (UTC)
:Well, 2-1 is not consensus. I had already stated my opposition to you prior to the discussion. I don't think that the UC Irvine alumni page can seriously be considered a &quot;non-diffusing category&quot; and as such should not be included when a subcategory is also included per [[WP:DUPCAT]].--[[User:Namiba|TM]] 14:34, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

== Your RFA ==
Hey GiantSnowman.  I sorry to tell you that your recent [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/GiantSnowman|RFA]] was unsuccessful.  You received considerable support from the community, however, with a final tally of (76/36/10) so you shouldn't be discouraged.  Work on the concerns of the opposers and in a few months time, consider making another application.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this closure or the process in general.  All the best, look forward to seeing you around and working with you, [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 18:23, 21 January 2011 (UTC)
:My condolences; as noted, it was really close. I'd also like to suggest you try a second Rfa this spring. Thanks for your service to the encyclopedia, and Best Wishes! [[User:Jusdafax|Jusdafax]]   18:51, 21 January 2011 (UTC)
::A shame, but clearly the right close. Keep up the good work - you're highly valued as many supporters (indeed opposers too) noted; Fell free to hit me up in the summer for a review if you think it would help. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Pedro|&lt;b&gt;Pedro&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Pedro|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#accC10;background:#0000fa;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chat&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:03, 21 January 2011 (UTC)
:::I second Pedro. I've nominated a few candidates for RfAs that have ended up at almost every result possible (SNOW closures, at least one really borderline no consensus and 3 successful that got to WP:100) and I've been through two of my own, as well, so I know RfA is tough. However, I hope you won't feel too discouraged. You are, by all accounts, a great editor and a prolific writer and, given that you very rarely pop up on my watchlist, it would seem that you know how to keep out of trouble, which is desirable in an admin. Just because the community doesn't think you're ready at the minute doesn't mean that they'll never trust you. I fell flat on my face in spectacular style in my first attempt but passed my second, as did a friend of mine [[User:Panyd]] and then there's [[User:Ironholds]] (another friend of mine) who tried and failed ''six'' times but succeeded in his seventh attempt. I guess this is a bit of a long winded way of saying that my oppose was nothing personal and that, if you do want to be an administrator spend some time getting to grips with the issues raised in your RfA wile still keeping out of trouble and try again in four months or so. Just for the record, adminship isn't that exciting...

:IMHO, the only thing you did wrong is perhaps you should have put a little more thought into some of your answers.

:::Hi GiantSnowman. May I add a note out here. Do go through all the points that the opposing editors made. While some may, you might perceive, have given reasons not pertinent, most of the reasons are quite logical. One particular issue I may point out for your consideration - and that is the articles you've created. ''Do kindly go through all the articles you've created and if you believe they can be improved, do that.'' Having said that, I should mention that I'm sure the next time you run for RfA, in spring perhaps as HJ mentions, you might get support from even those who have opposed you this time, editors like 28bytes included (who has brought forward very logical issues). Do drop in for any assistance in the future.

::::Wifione is correct, I'm absolutely open to supporting you in a future RfA. You've done a lot of great work here and that's widely recognized, even among the opposers. One suggestion I can add: go through the archives of the successful and unsuccessful RfAs and try to get a feel for what questions pop up frequently. RfA is notorious for &quot;trick&quot; questions, but if you've done your homework and know what to expect, you're less likely to run into one that trips you up, and the RfA participants will be more apt to focus on your concrete contributions instead of hypotheticals.

I just wanted to add my comments. I too was disapointed with the focus on the answers by the oppose crowd. I have to agree though that your responses did show a lack of being secure in policy - and least in expressing it. Personally - being an admin for a number of years I still would need to check before acting especially as policy, guidelines and accepted practise do change over time, and my involvement with the project has been minimal for quite some time. On the other hand your actions show exactly what I am looking for in an admin. Treading carefully with the best of the project in mind. I wish you all the best for the future - hoping to be around when you decide to try again. [[User:Agathoclea|Agathoclea]] ([[User talk:Agathoclea|talk]]) 14:22, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

* Me too. I went through three RfAs and even [[wikipedia:requests for adminship/Thumperward 3|my successful one]] was contentious for all sorts of reasons. You didn't fail by much, all things considered, and the support you got was very broad (me and DGG ''very'' rarely agree on RfA candidates). Stick at it and don't worry too much about trying again: at some point you'll feel the call and I don't have any doubt you'll pass next time.

== Confessions ==

Hi there SNOWY, VASCO here,

of course, i was a little over the top in the last discussion at WP:FOOTY, of course no one (well at least the vast majority) is out to annoy me and ruin my work, and i feel most of the well intended users are much more flexible than myself when it comes to having one's edits altered, i 100% admit to that.

However, i guess i will never understand when some users fail to reply to my messages when i am being polite (and i don't mean writing to them ONCE, i mean writing 3, 4, 5 messages and having to &quot;enjoy the silence&quot;, much more &quot;interesting&quot; when i see they answer to others). I am also growing ever so frustrated with the vandals who have nothing better to do than do &quot;what they do best&quot;, and sometimes get my ideas mixed :(

All in all, i guess i overreacted a lot. Please accept my apologies if you were offended by my remarks. Kind regards, from Portugal - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 22:55, 31 January 2011 (UTC)

== Interesting ==

Hi there o &quot;giant one&quot;, VASCO here,

we might want to keep a close attention on this Spanish user, [[User:Niquinio|Niquinio]], writes ZERO summaries and operates solely on soccer. In [[Juande]]'s article, you can clearly see how all external links say his birthplace was X, this user corrected it to Y, and it turns out he was correct (i since retrieved a REF that attests to that).

Have a look at his reaction after my message to him (please see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Niquinio), like i committed a crime or told &quot;the world's greatest joke&quot;. I already re-replied. Also, see what i mean with my previous tirade in WP:FOOTY? One guy (pretty much) insults me and, once i try to get some explanations, get no answer whatsoever.

Just in case you want to keep a close eye on this user (i most certainly will!), kind regards - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 03:44, 2 February 2011 (UTC)

*(Apparently) no worries mate, he has replied (so have i accepting his apologies), he is a newbie who really does not &quot;know his way around&quot; WP all that well still. He is in no way a vandal, and seems poised to be a useful contributor in Spanish football. Again (it seems :(), i was too picky and hasty.

*Regarding your last question, i agree with you partially. However, he does not talk to people, he removes messages from his talkpage, he has removed REFS (i spoke about that at last WP:FOOTY entry, about this very last IP), etc, etc. Clearly does more bad than good i reckon - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 22:03, 2 February 2011 (UTC)

*Still left some, because whenever i step into an article, it's pretty much for sure i will try to clean it up if needs be.

Hi. Can you be more specific regarding sources required etc. As stated much of the material can only be verified from material in a private collection which is not in the public domain but could be examined. I will correct the formatting of references having read the guidelines more thoroughly!

Thanks for your note re Dave Syers.  My own records say 10 August was the date and the BBC Sport piece (Reference number 14 of the article) quotes the manager saying on Friday 13 August that Syers signed on the Tuesday.  I make that 10 August, which is why I said I made the change as per the verification.  Mind you, I'd love to know how he signed with Guiseley and then trialled with Bradford a matter of days later.

do you have any idea why the reports on [[User:Zombie433]] (you did the last on ANI) get tons of inputs and opinions/suggestions (as it should!) and mine regarding [[User:Pararubbas|this guy]] get none at all (i took advantage of your Zombie report and wrote a few lines on this vandal as well, and wrote some lines at WP:FOOTY - this &quot;user&quot; edits solely on soccer - got ZERO feedback, the friendly message i received from [[User:FkpCascais]] not counting as technical help)? I don't have any clue, but it's a bit bothering, i would like to know where am i going wrong.

Sad news is we can't seem to override these problems, Zombie has a vast array of anon IPs, this other chap is vying to beat the all-time sock record, and also has several anon IPs to work with. Sad, sad indeed...

Hi.  Just wondering where you initially got his DoB?  If I recall properly, various stats sites didn't have his DoB and eventually listed the same DoB that is listed here of 20 May 1989.  I ask because, I found [http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/2bu/2bu/view/20110129-317200/Catching-up-with-the-Azkals-in-training this], and if you scroll down in that article, it lists 30 September 1988 as his DoB.  Coincidentally, it's also the same birth date as his older brother Chris Greatwich but obviously different year.

You don´t imagine how many biographies are done with guys from one country ignoring the careers the guy had before. And there comes FKP completing what the fukin´IP didn´t wanted to do... It´s about less known players. I wan´t convert David Beckham because I heard he played in some school when kid, don´t warry... Those are mostly guys from lower leagues, so completing their careers is quite a favour! I wan´t do it if I need to make much work to do it, but I´ll do it easily by old method and convert it later. We have tousands of unconverted articles, why not one more of some obscure guy who´s career isn´t completed anyway! And I´m saying only for the many uncomplete ones... OK, nevermind, I´ll probably loose this one, and I knew it all the way. I just didn´t expected to see it called nonsence, when clerly it isn´t, mosly because a few obscure incomplete biographies want make a difference in a universe of tousands of much more important that are still unconverted...

== Player notability ==

Thank you for your support on this issue. I'm relatively new to taking an active role in the deletion process but I can tell you have to step on some peoples toes to maintain the integrity of the encyclopaedia. It does strike me as odd that a WikiProject is going directly against its parent WikiProject by ignoring its key policies on notability. I'm going to attempt my first multiple AfD nomination shortly so hopefully I don't screw it up! Oh, and if you haven't seen it already then I'd recommend you revisit [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aylestone Park F.C. (2nd nomination)|this AfD]]. If a level 10 cut off point for English clubs is correct then surely it would be stated on [[WP:FOOTYN]], but then it would be favouring one country over another wouldn't it? Confusing.

On the other hand, Donnelly's info box says he played at [[Thames A.F.C.]] 1930–1932 but the Građanski article claims a certain Donnelly coached the team 1930–1931. Cheers.

Do you support them by any chance? I've been wondering for a while. If you do then can I ask what on earth is going on there?

My first season as a supporter was our first in that division and I'm prepared for the return next season - if someone will hurry up and buy us!

Saxton will probably have to drop into non-league now, which he is better than, but hopefully that will kick-start his career. Good to see you win today. We were docked ten points in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/9401625.stm February] so everyone pretty much wrote us off. Later that day, our then deputy chairman left the country to [http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/Stapleton-emerges-pledge-loyalty/article-3262909-detail/article.html have a holiday] at a 5-star hotel in Dubai. Leaving the staff, who have mortgages to pay and families to feed, to try and salvage a football club from the mess that the board created, without pay. Classy, right? We won again today and at least four of the team are carrying injuries, so with three games to go we're three points from safety with a game in hand. If we do go down then everyone involved with the club right now can hold their heads high.

Thanks. We just ran out of puff in the end, but at least we had enough points to stay up if it wasn't for director incompetence and greed. I've had a scan of the league tables and it looks like we could have first ever league meetings with up to six clubs next season. Accrington Stanley and Stevenage, if they don't get promoted, Aldershot Town, Morecambe and Burton Albion for certain, and either AFC Wimbledon or Fleetwood Town, if they do get promoted. If anything it should at least be fun, visiting lots of new, compact grounds. I was getting bored of going to places like the Hawthorns, Molineux, Portman Road and Deepdale anyway...

==[[Arthur Brown (footballer born 1885)]]==
Hi, I have a few queries regarding this edit you made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Brown_(footballer_born_1885)&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=419111558]
*How come you changed back the format of the infobox, away from the &quot;single line&quot; format, which admiitedly I had changed from the original. I took that format from a number of key editors on here, and I thought there was some consensus that this form was best/easiest for the editor, although I realise it is not something that is shown in the template as it stands.
*You've re-added his death date but there is no reference for this. I thought the entry probably came from an accurate source and hence I hid it.
*Similarly, you removed the question marks regarding the years of his club career. The only source in the article relating to his club career is the Michael Joyce book, and this does not confirm the years he was with his clubs, only the start and end seasons that he played league football for them. 
Regards. [[User:Eldumpo|Eldumpo]] ([[User talk:Eldumpo|talk]]) 16:39, 4 May 2011 (UTC)

:Thanks for response. The edit diff you showed indicates I added the year of death to parts of the article. I didn't add the date of death, which had [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Brown_(footballer_born_1885)&amp;diff=359436202&amp;oldid=324668785 previously been added] by an IP.

What do you expect if you go plastering tags over people's articles without bothering to do the research and then drill people irritating drilled messages? Given that you only care about anglo-centric football, your tagging of [[Al-Shorouk]] comes across as stalking and unnecessary, If you want an article improved, kindly ask and the response would be equally as kind. As for the football bio, given that he was involved in a major scandal, I'd be content to redirect into the club article if he fails WP:Bio. ♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;color:#000&quot;&gt;Dr. Blofeld&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:19, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

If you are going to create useless stubs on bottom league reserve footballers like [[Alan Burton]] can you at least provide a reference and indicate some sort of notability in reliable sources. At present it is a BLP violation and an experienced editor such as yourself should know this. BLPs MUST contain inline sources. You've been warned.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;color:#000&quot;&gt;Dr. Blofeld&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:53, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

No, an external link is not good enough. Ask anybody who references BLPs. It must contain an inline citation, otherwise it would be tagged an an unreferenced BLP and you'd be drilled a message at a later date, trust me on that. An inline citation to soccer base should suffice.  I really don't think its worth having such a short stub right now, but I understand he meets requirements because of &quot;professional athlete&quot; amd is likely to become more notable as his career develops. Don't you think though there is a flaw in the requirement that football clubs must be 100% professional? It means that premier league players from other countries are not even entitled to an article yet it permits small stubs on 4th division players in anglo centric countries who have a highly develop football base. To me this requirement demonstrates major bias in coverage taking advantage of the fact many poorer countries in Asia and Africa are not wealthy enough to be fully professional or have an undeveloped football base.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps;color:#000&quot;&gt;Dr. Blofeld&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:00, 8 May 2011 (UTC)
:I've converted the EL into a reference; it doesn't make any difference whatsoever, but if it pleases you, then whatever. The guy only made his professional debut, as soon as sources come available (and I'll do some more searching ASAP) I'll obviously improve the article. As for notability requirements for footballers in general - the current guideline is [[WP:NFOOTBALL]], and should you wish to change that, I suggest starting a discussion there. However, if memory serves me correctly, a recent attemot to change the guidline failed. Regards, [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 14:17, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

I see. Yes, he has only played one game so obvious sources are not going to be great. I've added a bit, but I doubt until he plays a full season he'll have much coverage. That's OK for now.  As for footballer notability I mostly agree, however I would make a slight change to rule which makes any player who has made a first team appearance in the top football division of any country notable. I'll suggest it perhaps..  If you create further articles like this in future though be sure to swap an external links with a inline source otherwise they'll BLP tag it later.

Please read the final edited version before reverting back to your less accurate version.
Max Cream is no longer a Wexford player.
He had a number of trials with English prior to being offered a trial with Stoke City where he did not win a deal and made the move to Scotland.
He was fulltime at Dundee Utd. And Dunfermline but played only youth football at Dundee United. At Dunfermline he played all first team friendly matches, a number of reserve and u19 matches before being released.
He left to join the LA Galaxy on trial, scoring in one of 2 matches he played with the club before leaving to Germany.
He spent less than half a season with Shelbourne making 2 league and 1 cup appearance.
He returned here to the US and had trials with Chicago Fire, Vancouver Whitecaps and Portland Timbers before signing a 2 year deal with Cleveland City Stars in Feb. 2009, so by all accounts he would have returned to the US the end of 2008 latest, not February 2009 as your edit suggests.
Your edit makes no suggestion of why he left Cleveland (to return to the UK) then goes straight into how he moved from Bournemouth Poppies to Bashley. 
Our records show that he returned to us in September not October and the years listed in the club listings are wrong also.
I have a number of photos that I can happily forward to you to place onto this page.
You also need to distinguish between league and total appearances/goals as you just list number in the dialogue but some are total and others are league.

== [[Dani Sánchez (footballer)]] ==

Hi there SNOWMAN my friend, VASCO here,

in this player's article, i have corrected several stuff regarding (some of) the clubs he appeared for in Spain, and the corresponding years. As you can see, i added a new link which attests to that (please see FUTBOLME.com), hence, he does not have 23/2 for [[Real Murcia Imperial]] as he played there 3 years, not one as you originally input. Also, if you look closely at the link i provided, it reads &quot;2002/03 MÁLAGA JUVENIL&quot;, hence it was a youth team still.

Speaking of LINKS: please allow for some of references to be relocated as links and remain as such, here and at [[Marco Paixão]] (i have not reverted you again in the latter since, as i respect your work and persona - i am only waiting for your YES), i think you once told me regarding this approach it did not matter, they could be inserted as either links or refs, please humour me on this one if you can, please (if i am not quoting you right and there is NO CHANCE the refs can be turned into links, never mind me).

Furthermore, the first DAILY RECORD ref may be misleading because it says the player is a &quot;...former Real Murcia and Real Betis hitman...&quot;, which is not 100% accurate, as he only played for the RESERVES, never for the main squad, as BDFUTBOL.com can attest (it only mentions the [[Segunda División B]] season). The TRANSFERMARKT.com ref also does not mention anything about his Spanish career, but i kept it because you inserted it.

Last, i inverted you order of story because he played first in SPAIN, then ABROAD. Kind regards, &quot;whistle&quot; back when you can - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 21:09, 17 May 2011 (UTC)

First, kindly refrain from bogus charges of &quot;incivility&quot;. When you include blog posts as &quot;references&quot;, it's perfectly appropriate to wonder if you've made yourself familiar with [[WP:USERG]]. Second, [http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/theportugeezer/archive/2011/03/02/what-next-for-portugal-s-europa-league-trio.aspx this] is not part of the reliable content of ''FourFourTwo''. It's a blog post by an amateur (&quot;a journalist through delusion&quot;) and as such unusable per that very same [[WP:USERG]], which leaves open the possibility of using &quot;interactive columns hosted by news outlets they call blogs&quot; &amp;mdash; ''so long as the writers are professional journalists or are professionals in the field on which they write and the blog is subject to the news outlet's full editorial control''. The author meets neither of the criteria, and as far as we can tell, the blog isn't subject to ''FourFourTwo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editorial control. Plus, it barely mentions the Big Three, so we lose precious little by its removal. - [[User:Biruitorul|Biruitorul]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Biruitorul|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 02:22, 23 May 2011 (UTC)
:About [http://nifootball.blogspot.com/ this blog]: I'm not saying the information contained therein is inaccurate, but it absolutely is against policy to source content through it. Again, [[WP:RS]]: &quot;Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy&quot;. A blog does not meet that high standard. And [[WP:BLOG]]: &quot;self-published media, such as ... personal or group blogs ... are largely not acceptable as sources&quot;. (The only narrow and tentative exception is for content &quot;produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work '''in the relevant field''' has previously been published by reliable third-party publications&quot; &amp;mdash; not applicable here. So yes, if you wanted to use that blog, you'd have to trace the reliable source where the blog got its information and quote that; the blog itself is not quotable on an encyclopedia that strives for quality sourcing.
:About ''FourFourTwo'' - again, the author is an avowed amateur (not permitted per [[WP:USERG]]) and we don't know if the magazine exercises &quot;full editorial control&quot; over the blog - again, we need to know that. Appeals to common sense are all well and good, but per [[WP:BURDEN]], proving that a source is reliable lies with the editor adding the source, and you have not come up with the proof, while I have cast serious doubt on its acceptability. - [[User:Biruitorul|Biruitorul]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Biruitorul|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 14:15, 23 May 2011 (UTC)

Thanks. I'm reluctant to start giving out 3RR warnings to the other party to something I'm involved in. I was surprised, actually, he's not usually as possessive as that about the odd word. cheers, [[User:Struway2|Struway2]] ([[User talk:Struway2|talk]]) 18:11, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO &quot;here&quot;,

any particular reason as to why ONLY my discussions are ignored? Kind of a &quot;downer&quot;... --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 22:46, 1 June 2011 (UTC)

== Fkp ==

First of all let me assure you I had NO intention of filing a report against User:FkpCascais, and that if I had, I would naturally have notified him (as I had done in the past). In retrospect perhaps I should've done so regardless, but rest assured the omission was''' not''' due to any premeditated &quot;plan&quot; on my part.

My inquiry, however, apparently drew attention to the [[WP:3RR]] violation on the part of User:FkpCascais, one that I was not even aware of at the time (I've not counted his reverts). FPS is an admin well acquainted with enWiki's Balkans articles, and the user had been placed on ARBMAC notice due to previous edit-warring [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFkpCascais&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=424317250&amp;oldid=424234635]. In this instance, the user once again violated [[WP:3RR]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yugoslav_Front&amp;diff=431848433&amp;oldid=431838049][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yugoslav_Front&amp;diff=431958734&amp;oldid=431950596][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yugoslav_Front&amp;diff=432053385&amp;oldid=432024281][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yugoslav_Front&amp;diff=432108556&amp;oldid=432092005]), this time to remove a long-standing related image from the article, against talkpage opposition, and without consensus. The only justification he posted was that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Meeting_between_German,_Chetniks_and_Domobran_commander.jpg this] image is somehow the &quot;same&quot; as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chetniks_with_German_soldiers.jpg this] image and that &quot;clearly&quot; therefore one of those two should be removed.

To sum-up, in retrospect it was a mistake on my part not to notify Fkp (in spite of not my not intending to report him for anything), but the user was clearly (once again) in violation of [[WP:3RR]], and was specifically warned against doing so beforehand. --&lt;font face=&quot;Eras Bold ITC&quot;&gt;[[User:DIREKTOR|&lt;font color=&quot;DimGray&quot;&gt;DIREKTOR&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:DIREKTOR|&lt;font color=&quot;Gray&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 00:15, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

:Check the article edit history and you´ll see I had one revert divided into 3 edits (so I could explain to this people each one... grrrrr, silly me) and I used the word rv in 2 of them. Oh, and direktor actualy failed to notify me several times now when filling reports against me. Funny he says the oposite, what was he thinking, that I don´t remember... :) (Direktor, my IQ is ridiculously low I am stupid as I can get, however just enough to remember some things, lucky me!). You can see his and mine block logs, and see the trouth. And he allways uses this rethoric of &quot;and he was warned of...&quot; an such... Btw, all my blocks were related with incidents with this user GiantSnowman, and in one (the first) I was also not warned and blocked before even having a chance to defend myself, the second block was for sending direktor somewhere (it was long time ago and I was frontal, silly me, low IQ obviously) and the third was because I reported a user (btw, coincidence, one of direktors best friends [[User:AlasdairGreen27]]) that told me direct obscenities at my talk page, and Less decided to block ''me'' instead for insisting at the report, while (for some strange reason) some users appeared saying in the report that &quot;''kiss your sorry ass''&quot; was not an NPA (!).

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO here,

i feel a bit embarrassed by my behaviour, again not following the WP rules...i'll elaborate: on [[Borja Criado]], i have removed twice the tag you inserted that the article was unreferenced (last time i promise!), because in my opinion it is very well referenced, i worked my butt off to improved article, and i felt it was more than adequate for a player of his caliber, yet you say it is not.

Can you my friend (and no sarcasm here, i respect and admire you overall) tell me why do you see this article as orphan? Again, i promise i will not remove the tag again, even though i disagree. Kind regards, from Portugal - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 14:36, 8 June 2011 (UTC)

*So that's what orphan means! Getting wiki-sillier by the minute my friend! I thought that it meant &quot;having no refs&quot;. I present my sincere apologies to you mate, the tag STAYS! - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 14:47, 8 June 2011 (UTC)

*As [[Groucho Marx]] would've put it: explain it to me like i'm a six-year old :)

So if &quot;orphan&quot; means that no other links link to Criado's (in this case) page, what do all the wikilinks we find in his page ([[CE Europa]], [[La Liga]], [[Valencia CF]], [[Forward (association football)|forward]], etc) mean? Aren't those links (well wikilinks)? Help me friend, i'm at a loss :( - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 23:00, 8 June 2011 (UTC)

==[[WP:FPL]]==
Hi, when you added the verifiability tag to the Albania entries at this page, did you mean it to cover all three sources, as Bettia's comments on the talk page seem to suggest that at least two of them refer to a professional league, and if we are going to question whether 'just' referring to the word professional is enough then that would apply to a large number of entries on the list. I believe a consensus has built up over what reasonably should be included, and only a handful of the entries are not sourced. Bear in mind that the description applied to the page 'fully pro league' is not in any way defined, and it would be very difficult to do so and back it up with sources.

As the article's creator, I was wondering if it would be okay with you if I were to move the article to &quot;Tommie Hoban&quot;? The two primary sources ([http://www.watfordfc.com/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10400~55627,00.html Watford] and the [http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101651:under-17s-seek-win-for-uefa-hopes&amp;catid=6:under-17&amp;Itemid=17 FAI]) spell his name with an -ie, as do the [http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/9017617.Hoban_latest_scholar_handed_deal/?ref=rss Watford Observer]. Sky Sports initially used [http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3372270,00.html Tommy] when he somewhat unexpectedly made his debut, but appear to have since adopted [http://origin.skysports.com/football/player/0,19754,11686_466549,00.html Tommie]. The BBC did likewise, but haven't written about him since the Preston match. Soccerbase and the Press Association currently use Tommy, although I question how much weight should be given to sources that missed [[Sean Murray (footballer)|Sean Murray]]'s debut, can't get Ireland under-21 international [[Rob Kiernan]]'s nationality right, and still have [[Jure Travner]] and [[Scott Severin]] listed as Watford players.

If you think Tommy should stick that's cool. I don't see much value in an out-and-out move request unless he becomes higher profile in future, but thought I'd see if it's uncontroversial.

== Graham Moseley ==

Hello, GiantSnowman.

I have taken extensive notes on various footballers' careers through the years.  Until recently, these notes were strictly old school - ink on paper.  And since these notes were written down for my personal use long before wikipedia, I didn't think to jot down my sources.  A shame really, 'cause I sit on a wealth of material.  (I do understand the need to disclose sources, though.)  

Perhaps you would like to act on some of my unsourced contributions as a sort of &quot;tip&quot; that you can investigate, instead of removing it entirely?
Just a friendly and humble thought...

Speaking of Graham Moseley: he did go to Ipswich Town on loan in March 1984 even if he never made a league appearance. I do have a source for that particular fact: Rothman's Football Yearbook 1984-85 p. 429.

==Removal of template on Conor Ramsay==
The removal of the stats template on the page was perfectly relevant, as I'm the only person that updates Morton stats (except that annoying wee guy that updates the goalscorers and nobody else), I will have to update that stupid wee box as well as the infobox and I can't be fucked if I'm being honest. It's completely unnecessary for a kid that we have no idea if he'll make it at this level, especially after 5 games in two bloody years! How's about you ask, and look at the reality of the situation, before copying and pasting a generic response on my page.

Dear GiantSNowman,
in regards to my edit to [[Otman Bakkal]], if you looked at the article, you would see a sentence is misplaced and put twice. You would see: &quot;In November 2010, Bakkal was bitten by Luis Suárez on the shoulder during the 0-0 draw between PSV and Ajax on 20 November 2010.&quot; It is listed on both the club career section and internation career section. The sentence does not apply to his international career, and should not be in that category. All my edit did was remove it from where it did not belong, and should be fixed.

== [[Darren Stephenson]] &amp; [[Bradford City A.F.C.]] ==

Hi GiantSnowman, as regards the change i made to the Bradford City A.F.C. squad listing showing Darren Stephenson being Jamaican, was based on Darren Stephenson's own Wikipedia page stating that he was born in [[Jamaica]] and that there is no evidence there that he has played for any other international representative side, thus making him Jamaican. I fail to see how this is not seen to be constructive. Regards. [[User:Prof bed|Prof bed]] ([[User talk:Prof bed|talk]]) 13:04, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:So is his Wiki page wrong? To be honest i have found over the last few years many inaccuracies in Premium TV's Football League websites player profiles, mainly nationalities and dates of birth. A good example of an inaccuracy on the very same section is under Scott Brown, who has been given details of the [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] captain, [[Scott Brown (Scottish footballer)|Scott Brown]], and not the 16 year old from [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]]!! If Stephenson was in fact born in England or has played for England Schools or whatever then obviously thats fair enough. Sorry, its because ive kept my own records for years and a big green Jamaican flag stands out amongst the St Georges flags on my spreadsheet that i noticed it and changed it. Regards [[User:Prof bed|Prof bed]] ([[User talk:Prof bed|talk]]) 13:17, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

==Non-League club AfDs==
Hello Snowman. I'm hoping to persuade you to change your mind in the AfDs on Rustington and the other Sussex League club. Previously clubs playing at that level have been assumed to be notable, as Step 6 is the level at which clubs can enter the FA Cup. In these specific cases the clubs can't because of a lack of floodlights - however, this would mean having articles for some clubs in the division, but not others, and I think it would be better to have a complete set. Plus as I noted in one AfD, we can't rely on the FOOTYN for clubs because it makes 6,000 French clubs eligible for articles (as any club can enter the Coupe de France)!

== Notability regarding French clubs ==

I read your message at [[WT:FOOTY]] and agree that ''Club notability'' needs a overhaul. My personal suggestion regarding French clubs in the [[Coupe de France]] would be since every club is eligible to participate in the competition, the only clubs that should merit notability on Wikipedia are the ones that reach the 7th Round since that is the round professional clubs in France start off or possibly the Round of 64 since that is the round where the [[French Football Federation]] site starts archiving results at leaving the early round results to the regional sites. See [http://www.fff.fr/competitions/php/histo_cfra/histo_cfra.php?sa_no=2008&amp;pj_no=1 here]. — &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;[[User:Joao10Siamun|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;JS&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Joao10Siamun|&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;Rant Away&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 20 July 2011 (UTC)

:::: Hey GiantSnow, I think you should take a more exahustive look on the thing. It is proverbial how this Jabbsworth behaves against any user woh shows any oposition to his pro-euthanasia agenda. He does use always a rude and aggresive language and behaivour to exasperate the users. It has happened over the time with his precious sockpuppets and now again. See the last weeks, after being unblocked: 24 hours after being unblocked he got a block for edit warring, he is going to get a topic ban, he is going to get an interaction ban with me, of course surely I also will get a topic ban as I lost my patience with his PAs. Just take a look at the ANI where I have provided enough links showing his behavbiour: he permanently refers to usres with expression like: &quot;incomprehensible grammar&quot;, &quot;tenuous grasp of English&quot;,  &quot;broken english&quot;, &quot;poor reading comprehension&quot;, &quot;vandalism&quot;, &quot;rubish&quot;, &quot;insane point of view&quot;, &quot;bloody minded&quot;, risible&quot;,&quot;pathetic&quot;, &quot;pointless&quot;.He always trigger edit wars in order to get blocks to scare and get other users far away, recently he experessively asked to NotBW to stay away from the pages he built, etc. In few weeks he is angeaged in two wars against two users, that is poroverbial!!!. Also notice that this NotBW was Jabbsworth's wikifriend who was encouraged by Jabbswroth against me, ans certainly NotBW helped him.

Hi, thank you for your message. I want to say that I do have the functionality to transfer the contents of items with their new appointments. I create the appointment'''Wydad AC Casablanca''' long time ago but it has caused to be delivered to his old appointment '''Wydad Casablanca''', so it was impossible to transfer the article again so I used the copy paste method while putting the word'''redirect''' in the former appointment.&lt;br&gt;

Just a quick question if the league was later removed from fully pro and as per [[WP:Footy]] wasnt notable would that effect players who have played in the league now and previously or just ones in the future just asked as just asked another user why they were prodding articles for the first Divison and refereed to discussion ongoing but some had played in the division a few years back so at the time it would be fully pro.

Sad sad sad! I know i should never have fed the trolls, but does this justify what they are doing in the taunting department? In [[Míchel Salgado]], some &quot;user&quot; continues to remove bits of INTRO, screwing links, etc (see here http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M%C3%ADchel_Salgado&amp;diff=445022329&amp;oldid=443876991).

In [[José Carlos Fernández Vázquez]], i think it's even worse: some guy, after i reported him two years ago and blocked some IPs/protected some pages for his disruptive editing, is trying to get me to lose it and suffer (an even bigger) block, he's succeeding! He even goes as far as to remove the AEK ATHENS F.C PLAYERS category, his CURRENT club!!

Regarding the latter, i have already asked for administration intervention, have no hopes for a positive reply. Please have a look to some of the messages i sent him explaining what he was adding to the article was WRONG (here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:86.163.52.66 and here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:86.163.205.60). Of course, if he is who i think he is (not an AEK football fan, but a vandal who's after me trying me to lose it - and succeeding!), this means nothing.

Kind regards, keep it up - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 22:46, 16 August 2011 (UTC)

== Images ==

If your uploading an image from Flickr do you upload it to [[special:upload]], [[commons:special:upload here]] or [[commons:special:]]. Also what’s the policy on replacing images for example if a player is at a new club &amp; you want to change the image for newer image rather than one of the player at his previous club? Are all images on Flickr allowed once they're appropriate.(&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734; [[User:DUCKISJAMMMY|&lt;font color=&quot;Fuchsia&quot;&gt;DUCK&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;IS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Fuchsia&quot;&gt;JAMMMY&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;#9734;&amp;#9733;) 23:28, 16 August 2011 (UTC)). 
:Ok thanks, seems like there are 7 different license options for Flickr images, I'll just create a Wikimedia Commons account &amp; go for it, still unsure about replacing older images with newer ones though.

== What the hey? ==

After all the discussions we had, a user (is it possible to see if it hails from Colombia as the other anon user who kept reverting us?) has changed the [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] page again. I have started a WP:FOOTY discussion and asked admin help. The account also wrote a serious unref'd sentence in the page of [[Ángel María Villar]] - president of the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]]: &quot;He is a [[FC Barcelona]] fan&quot; - meaning IMO the refs are &quot;instructed&quot; to make Barça win.

== [[User:Maxi1992]] ==

Hi Snowman, my discussion in [[WP:Footy]] seems to have been lost in the shuffle so I figured I'd come to you directly. I'm quite sure this is just the new account of [[User:Zombie433]]. He's made edits on the following players: [[Effosa Eguakon]], [[Jimmy Bulus]], [[Lassana Diallo]], [[Hervé Oussalé]] and [[Samad Oppong]], all articles that were either made by Zombie (3 of the 4) or pages he worked a lot on. For a &quot;new user&quot;, you have to admit that the chances of that are very rare. Also, his whole editing pattern is the same (just adding player names to notable players section of clubs, etc.), makes me more than sure it's him. Worst of all is that he's ruining articles with his pointless of edits. He doesn't bother reading (or ignoring?) the criteria for inclusion for notable players, he just adds players. I've already left him a page on his talkpage but I doubt that it will do much, so please do something about it. Thanks.[[User:TonyStarks|TonyStarks]] ([[User talk:TonyStarks|talk]]) 01:34, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO here,

[[User:Scoelho86]] (the guy who may also be the other guy from Colombia that has been on my case, they edited in THE SAME computer) has asked me, from what i understand, what does he need to do to join the WIKIFOOTBALL project. What should i tell him, i'm a bit rusty?

[[User:Satori Son]] (also an admin, has been greatly helpful to me in the past) has suggested that, if true they are the same person, he's playing some sort of &quot;good cop, bad cop&quot; mindgame with me, and that i should be very wary when dealing with Coelho.

Thanks for the WP:FOOTY reply SNOWMAN,

I seriously don't understand what Kevin McE has against me, another hostile response, even tough i once again failed in the edit summaries per WP guidelines. His WP:FOOTY edit summary (ironic) especially ticked me off (&quot;as you asked&quot;, meaning &quot;you want a suggestion, here's your suggestion&quot;), i have sent him a polite but to-the-point message, i find this quite strange (is he fed up with my summaries?

I don't want anyone to get a strange idea about me, which sometimes comes somewhat deservingly.

Regarding your question per this topic, it happened in [[Juvenal Edjogo-Owono]], which leads to the following approach: what players should be allowed to have SPANISH FOOTBALLERS in them? 1 - Those that were born and played (almost or not) their entire careers in Spain but were never capped (although most of them do eventually play int.games for Equatorial Guinea); 2 - the same in 1 but for the guys that did play for the other nation (Equatorial Guinea); 3 - both? - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 12:03, 31 August 2011 (UTC)

Hi there my friend, VASCO here,

one of the most vandalized (well, more than vandalized, POV'ed) pages i have ever seen here (the Greek &quot;fans&quot; and their &quot;passion&quot;) has brought this novelty: this user added this &quot;charmer&quot; (see here, in intro http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vieirinha&amp;diff=449084296&amp;oldid=448839265), which i immediately undid on the grounds of WP:NPOV - my only bad was that i should have provided a summary.

Ten minutes ago, i received a message calling my actions rude and unacceptable, &quot;interesting&quot;. I have already replied apologizing for the lack of summary, but explaining some of the site's guidelines (not very good at those i admit). Did i do the right thing? Methinks so...

*His posterior reply i have not fully come to terms with, as it seems to make me the bad guy, because he was &quot;expressing his admiration for the player, without any insults&quot; (not verbatim, but he said this), and i just removed it. Quite patronizing/sarcastic response in my humble opinion, and he seems to continue to think i have been rude with all the information in hand; i have re-replied.

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO here,

lost for words...this guy is relentless and does not write one summary. As expected, i received no reply about the Equatorial Guinea/Spain footballers situation, you were luckier there. 

What do i mean with &quot;relentless&quot;? In [[Julio Álvarez]], a 30-year old guy who has lived in [[Spain]] since his early infancy - his parents are BOTH Spaniards - having dual nationality, Kolins took it upon himself and removed summarily the SPANISH FOOTBALLERS category. He also added a VENEZUELA NATIONAL TEAM field in box, even though the player has not appeared yet with the team (he has the possibility, but has not so far). He has 28 caps and 5 goals all Spanish youth levels comprised, a bit Spanish no?

Of course i am through talking to someone who shows total lack of cooperation and regard for my opinion.

Oh damnit.  Sorry man, I got thrown off.  I looked at Martina's profile on soccerway and it said he made 14 appearances.

can you tell me what you make of this (please see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MrEskola)?

==Timothy Batabaire==
:You just have to dig a little deeper and use logic. The key here is to find articles that were written between 2003 and 2005 when the player is said to have played for the Serbian club and the wikipedia entry did not even exist yet. Articles that were written like 5 years later or so and claim that he played for Nis likely got their information from nft or the wikipedia article itself.

To avoid confusion the player joined Celtic in October 2004.[http://business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-122780063/batabaire-now-bloemfontein-celtic]

This article [http://www.sc-villa.com/latest-news/obwiny-batabaire-recalled-to-cranes.html] from 2003 has him playing for Villa, so has this one [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3808811.stm] from a about year later. This is exactly the time span when he is said to have played in Serbia but he is twice listed as a Villa player.
 
This article from 2004 confirms that he joined Celtic from Villa and not from Nis. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-14137730_ITM]. Same thing here [http://www.kickoff.com/news/8439/celtic-start-their-clear-out.php]. Still no mention of him joining from Nis or having played for Nis at all. Same thing here. [http://www.kickoff.com/news/10409/batabaire-back-in-sa.php]
All of his former clubs are mentioned. Except one. Odd...

Also his profile on weltfussball.de has no mention of him playing in Serbia either [http://www.weltfussball.de/spieler_profil/timothy-batabaire/]
   
And if youre still not convinced: Just google ''Timothy Batabaire OFK Nis'' and set the custom range from 2003 to 2004.

This is just another case where a website (nft.com) makes up stuff or simply confuses players and everybody else (playerhistory) just copies it.

::NFT stats that he spend with OFK Niš the second half of 2003-04 season, and beggining of 2004-2005. If he joined Celtic in October 2004, he may well have played the 3 matches NFT claims he played in 2004-05 season, as season in Serbia starts in August. He may well have played August and September with OFK Niš, before coming to Celtic in October 2004, so by that there is no proof of anything. He may also have easily been on loan in Serbia, something NFT don´t differenciate in their stats. And of course he played in 2003 with Villa, as second part of seasons in Serbia begins in March of next year, meaning he may well have played in 2003 with Villa, and moved in early 2004 to play those 8 matches in the second part of the 2003-04 season with OFK Niš.

did my best in searching for some more stuff for the club's history, but both your Google search and my YAHOO.ES yielded nothing relevant, not even when i inserted in the latter &quot;Historia del Antiguoko - Antiguoko's history&quot;.

This &quot;normal&quot; player's article has been subject to serious vandalism ever since i started editing here, was kind of getting used to it, but this i did not expect...why did you remove practical ALL of the international career section, which was ALL (by me, took me a few hours/days) referenced?

Club career was also drastically cut down, as the situation with the golf magazine (the source(s) contain reference to his Liverpool teammates) may i ask why was that info irrelevant (you also removed SOCCERBASE.COM totally, did not even used it as a ref, but i think that may have been an accident)? Attentively - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 01:45, 30 September 2011 (UTC)

*I understand your point 100% my friend, but &quot;hear&quot; me again: the REF#11 contained mention to his work in &quot;Golf Punk&quot; with (not Liverpool, my bad) his Sunderland teammates, it's not bad to write it, they are also footballers. In INTERNATIONAL CAREER, his own goal against Russia is also documented, why erase it? I am sorry, but i have embraced WP:BOLD and reinstated those bits, and have also retrieved a brand new ref to source his &quot;punditry&quot;.

Of course, you are totally correct in removing the part of him hitting his &quot;unmentionables&quot; against the post against Chelsea, that stuff - albeit comic - has no place being in an encyclopedia.

== &quot;Legal concern&quot; for Wikipedia Article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashif_Siddiqi ==

Snowman,

This message is sent on behalf of Kashif Siddiqi and is regarding his Wikipedia page. It is apparent that many of the statements at current are not up to date and false. We have attempted to contact you repeatedly to change and update the information but you refuse to do so and seem to revert back to changes we make.

Wikipedia hold responsibility on Kashif Siddiqi’s career as many employers, supporters and those interested in Kashif’s progress follow via it. Recently, a lucrative deal concerning Kashif Siddiqi’s future was delayed and almost lost due to the fact that Wikipedia and your article held false information on Kashif Siddiqi. I would think that Wikipedia being a very well known place to gather accurate and precise information that you would be interested in ensuring the information you display is correct.

This has now become a major problem and we have been advised that we have grounds for legal actions.
We have prepared an amended version of Kashif Siddiqi’s information and wish to replace the current Wikipedia page as soon as possible. We have provided media articles and links to back up the facts we have included. Our team is more than happy to provide any other identification documents or articles that you might require, and we hope we can get this matter resolved with minimal effort.


Thank you for your co-operation; hope to hear from you soon.

== Removing others' comments ==

It would be appreciated if you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=463908962 didn't revert my edit as vandalism]: it should have been obvious that this was a good-faith error, not something in which my comments should themselves be removed.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 00:10, 4 December 2011 (UTC)
:When you give no other summary than what we'd give for a vandal who does the same thing, and when you easily could have restored the text I accidentally deleted without removing mine, and when I've not heard anything from you, I have reason to say what I did above.  Thanks for the comment (no hard feelings); my only question is why you reverted everything instead of simply restoring the text that I accidentally deleted?  FYI, I have a new computer that's constantly moving me to different windows, and I've not yet figured out how to stop it — see the mess I got myself into with edit summaries at [[JPY (disambiguation)]].

Does this (see here http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Almami_Moreira&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=459828817) and refuses to participate in the discussions, even though the consensus continues to be THE SAME (BOTH categories remain, the lead should mention only the nation represented).

Pityful, i have ceased all interaction with this person, the &quot;undo&quot; button will speak for me (as in Moreira's case). Attentively, have a great week - --[[User:VascoAmaral|Vasco Amaral]] ([[User talk:VascoAmaral|talk]]) 23:21, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

== Birthplaces ==

Hello. You're right that [[WP:OPENPARA]] says that a person's birthplace doesn't need to go in the lead section. But it also says &quot;Birth and death places should be mentioned in the body if known&quot;. So to comply with WP:OPENPARA, when you remove the birthplace from the opening bracket, please would you replace it somewhere appropriate in the body of the article if it isn't already in there. thanks, [[User:Struway2|Struway2]] ([[User talk:Struway2|talk]]) 09:01, 8 December 2011 (UTC)

== [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1991)]] ==

When your back i was wondering if you could have a look at the stats table on the article I've had to use soccerway, Soccerbase and the hearts profile to try and get an accurate picture but I'm not sure i got it right. He definitely never made an appearance for heart in the 2010-11 season like soccerbase says that was David Smith and they are all missing his appearance in Europe in the 2009-10 season but Hearts clearly state he did. I would just appreciate another person looking at it.

:Good idea its a shame but more and more I'm finding Soccerbase to be inaccurate with Scottish stats especially for SFL players and Soccerway only goes back a few years and it makes it a lot harder. Im trying to add these to as many of the Hearts players articles especially the young ones who are actually getting paid and may stay at the club.

== [[Steve Kean]] ==

Read my comments in the talk area before reverting edits. If you continue to undo these edits. I will report you to Wikipedia for vandalising it's pages!

As i said on my talk page: &quot;Leave the 2nd table alone! It is not doing any harm and as i have already explained to you politely. It is relevent to this season's Premier League and Blackburn Rovers history. If you don't stop undoing this table. I will report you to Wikipedia Watchdogs for page vandalism. My edits are not causing problems. Yours are. I have Blackburn Rovers fans right now asking me what is going on with the Steve Kean page on Wikipedia and are asking me why the Premier League table keeps getting removed. I will continue to edit the Premier League and non Premier League table in the ongoing future. Stop accusing me of things when i am continuing to be neutral 'on Wikipedia' regards Steve Kean's page! I am discussing it. It has been discussed and myself and several other people disagree with you!&quot;[[User:RoverTheBendInSussex|RoverTheBendInSussex]] ([[User talk:RoverTheBendInSussex|talk]]) 16:41, 11 December 2011 (GMT)

== ani advice ==

Your ANI is obviously in good faith; however I'm noting that your replies are starting to get a bit snippy/snarky [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=466680253]. You've raised your concerns to the community; at this point is probably best to step give additional editors time to review and analyze the situation. Letting the other editor temporarily have the [[WP:LASTWORD]] is an indication of the strength of your logic and a sign of your confidence.

==Adam Larsen Kwarasey==
[[User:GiantSnowman|GiantSnowman]], please don't insult my intelligence by claiming my revisions are disruptive. I am 22 years old (born in 1989) and you are 23 years old, let's please be civil about this issue. I'm sure your a nice guy but this is clear common sense.

On the Wikipedia article [[Norwegian nationality law]] it clearly states that although [[Adam Larsen Kwarasey]] was born in [[Norway]], it does not make him to have Norwegian nationality, it is only because his mother was Norwegian that he had received Norwegian nationality at birth. The same goes as for Ghanaian citizenship because his dad was Ghanaian when he was born, he had a birthright to Ghanaian citizenship just as he did with Norwegian citizenship by his mother.

The category, [[:Category:Naturalized citizens of Ghana]] is flawed, why in the earth [[User:Kolins|Kolins]] created this category in the first place is a mistery. Let me tell you GiantSnowman there is really no such thing as Naturalization as a Ghanaian citizen, you can only have Ghanaian nationality if:

*1. only one of your parents were Ghanaian nationals when you were born. 
*2. or if you are married to a Ghanaian national.

You cannot even play for/represent Ghana at any sports even if your [[Grandparent]]s were born in Ghana, It has to be only if either you were born in Ghana or one of your parents were born in Ghana. There is nothing about needing evidence here, as I can see your not a Ghanaian as I am a Ghanaian myself, please try to do a little research on [[Google Search]] for &quot;Ghanaian citizenship &amp; Naturalization law&quot; and then leave me a message to tell me I have no evidence.  

*This information below from the Wikipedia article [[Norwegian nationality law]], clearly tells you that although born in Norway it does NOT automatically give you Norwegian nationality at birth;
 
;Birth in Norway

In general, birth in Norway does not, in itself, confer Norwegian citizenship.

*This information below from the Wikipedia article [[Norwegian nationality law]], tells you that although born in Norway it does not give you Norwegian nationality and that you can only have Norwegian nationality if one of your parents is Norwegian when born, so for instance this was Kwarasey's mother;

;Descent from a Norwegian parent

A child (born in Norway or elsewhere) acquires Norwegian citizenship at birth if:

* the father is a Norwegian citizen; or
* the mother is a Norwegian citizen.  
From 1 September 2006 the law no longer requires the father to be married to the mother.
Norwegian mothers have only been able to automatically pass on Norwegian citizenship since 1 January 1979.

Yes, the January fracas came and went. But it's almost one year; you've gained in experience (of RfAs, to say the least), wider understanding of how the community appreciates a clear understanding of our policies and guidelines, and some minor slug-fests too. In all, it'll be a pleasure to nominate you whenever you believe you are comfortable.[[User:Wifione|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;  Wifione&lt;/span&gt;''']] [[User talk:Wifione|'''&lt;sup&gt;Message&lt;/sup&gt;''']] 17:12, 22 December 2011 (UTC)

== Gregorio Blasco ==

I'll do it, but you can see the sources in each of the Copa del Rey Final articles ([[1930 Copa del Rey Final|1930 here]] and [[1931 Copa del Rey Final|1931 here]]). Besides, there are thousands of football players articles, and millions of awards given to them, and there are no footnotes with the links for each and every one of the trophies. Just go to the competition article and you'll see the source. 

And Gregorio Blasco won the Copa del Rey not only twice, but four times. I just add the awards in the footballers articles when I create the article of the final.

== Monegasque - Categories ==

Hi there SNOWMAN, VASCO here,

i have reverted several categories more (yes, in all cases, i removed the regional category as well, using &quot;undo&quot; or &quot;rollback&quot;, but if we reach consensus, it's just a matter of reinstating it - but the SPANISH FOOTBALLERS cat has to stay i believe, no gray area there!). Still many more to revert i believe, nice work!
