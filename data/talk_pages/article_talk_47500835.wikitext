[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:NickW557|NickW557]]. I wanted to let you know that I reverted one of [[Special:Contributions/18.189.38.230|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;—the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ladder%20toss&amp;diff=675640475 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Ladder toss]]— because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:NickW557|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:NickW557|Nick]]&amp;#8288;—&amp;#8288;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:NickW557|Contact]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/NickW557|Contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:22, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
