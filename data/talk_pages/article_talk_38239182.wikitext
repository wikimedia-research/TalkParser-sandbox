[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Addshore|Addshore]].

Wikipedia needs people like you and me to collaborate, so it's one of our core principles to interact with one another in a polite and respectful manner. If you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Addshore|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-npa1 --&gt; '''[[User:Addshore|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;·Add§hore·&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Addshore|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;T&lt;small&gt;alk&lt;/small&gt; T&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; M&lt;small&gt;e&lt;/small&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 00:33, 16 January 2013 (UTC)
