I've taken quite a lot of this information from the German wikipedia article ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%B6tenquartett see here]), which I have also requested to be translated (translation page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation/Flute_Quartet here]) - if you can help, please do!
