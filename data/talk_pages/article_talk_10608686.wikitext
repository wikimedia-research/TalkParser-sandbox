The name is spelled correctly in the external sources. That should be enough.

----

[[Fredric Hasselquist]] → [[Fredrik Hasselqvist]] – The mans name is Fredrik Hasselquist, as shown in all external sources, as well as in the Swedish version of Wikipedia. Spelling with &quot;c&quot; instead of &quot;k&quot; has no purpose for English speaking readers here and may even cause confusion as all sources available spell it with &quot;k&quot;.  As oulined in [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Wikipedia: Naming conventions]]: ''The most common name for a subject, as determined by its prevalence in reliable English-language sources, is often used as a title(...)'' and ''If there are too few English-language sources to constitute an established usage, follow the conventions of the language appropriate to the subject (German for German politicians, Portuguese for Brazilian towns, and so on)''.

Actually, in the source #1 Linneus does spell it with a ''c'' instead of a ''k''. Probably due to some variety being used in the 17'th century. Fact remains the Swedes do spell his name with a ''k''.[[User:Hazzelq|Hazzelq]] ([[User talk:Hazzelq|talk]]) 02:15, 29 February 2012 (UTC)
