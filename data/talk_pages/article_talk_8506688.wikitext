==License tagging for Image:Aluminiumhoneycomb1.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Aluminiumhoneycomb1.jpg]]. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
* [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
* [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]]. If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 09:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

==Industrial design==
Please do not add inappropriate external links to Wikipedia{{{{{subst:Subst|}}}#if:Industrial design|, as you did in [[:Industrial design]]}}. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory|Wikipedia is not a mere directory of links]] nor should it be used for advertising or promotion.  Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites with which you are affiliated, and links that exist to attract visitors to a web site or promote a product.  See [[Wikipedia:External links|the external links guideline]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam policies]] for further explanations of links that are considered appropriate.  If you feel the link should be added to the article, then please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it. See the [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] to learn more about Wikipedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Spam --&gt;  

Please do not add promotional material to Wikipedia{{#if:{{{1|}}}|, as you did on [[:{{{1}}}]]}}. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia is not]] a vehicle for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]]. You are, however, encouraged to add appropriate content to the encyclopedia. If you feel the material in question should be added to the article, then please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it.

No problem, I am still working out how to do wiki correctly - Oskar9

==How to sign your name==
Hello. In case you didn't know, when you add content to [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]] and Wikipedia pages that have open discussion, you should [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your posts]] by typing four tildes  ( &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; ) at the end of your comment. You may also click on the signature button [[Image:Button sig2.png]] located above the edit window.  This will automatically insert a signature with your name and the time you posted the comment. This information is useful because other editors will be able to tell who said what, and when. Thank you!&lt;!-- Template:Tilde --&gt; --[[User:Ronz|Ronz]] 23:59, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

==File source problem with File:Flys_eye.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thank you for uploading '''[[:File:Flys_eye.jpg]]'''. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, please add a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a brief restatement of that website's terms of use of its content. However, if the copyright holder is a party unaffiliated from the website's publisher, that copyright should also be acknowledged.

If you have uploaded other files, consider verifying that you have specified sources for those files as well. You can find a list of files you have created [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Oskar9}} in your upload log]. '''Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''' per Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F4|F4]]. If the image is [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyrighted]] and [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free]], '''the image will be deleted 48 hours after 15:32, 10 May 2011 (UTC)''' per [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] criterion [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F7|F7]]. If the file is already gone, you can still make a [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request for undeletion]] and ask for a chance to fix the problem.&lt;!-- Template:You can request undeletion --&gt; You may wish to read the Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:image use policy|image use policy]]. If you have any questions or are in need of assistance please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].
