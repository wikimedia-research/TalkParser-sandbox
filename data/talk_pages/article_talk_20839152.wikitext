Hi, Boreas74, 

I see you declare on your user page that you live in Malta. Take a look at the exact wording of the [[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll report] &quot;Europeans and Their Languages&quot; to see where I was coming from as I wrote the article text you just changed. (I just reverted the text back to the way it was before after I checked the source, but perhaps we can discuss a more nuanced wording together on the article talk page.) I too was surprised by the treatment of the language situation in Malta in the report. -- [[User:WeijiBaikeBianji|WeijiBaikeBianji]] ([[User talk:WeijiBaikeBianji|talk]], [[User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Editing|how I edit]]) 21:17, 15 April 2015 (UTC)
