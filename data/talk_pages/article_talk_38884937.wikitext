== Jupiter and Saturn ==

I looked for sources on the minimum distance to Jupiter because of the change 350,000 -&gt; 349,000 and [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/tmp/1977-084A-traj.html found] the number of 4.89 Jovian radii (71398 km) which would make a distance of 349,000 km as now in the article (349,136.22 km but with only 3 digits on the first number the missing 136.22 km become pointless (try with 4.885 to 4.894 RJ))--[[User:Deelkar|Deelkar ]] [[User_talk:Deelkar|(talk)]] 04:41, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== How far out is Voyager? ==

The article says Voyager 1 was 100 AU's from the sun on November 5, 2003. But then it says it was 93.2 AU's from the sun in September 2004. I assume it didn't backtrack. Which figure is correct? [[User:MK2|MK2]] 05:51, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

===Response (How far out is Voyager)===

If you look here, [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/index.htm], you can see that as of November 25, 2005, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 9,059,000,000 miles from the Sun. Since an AU is approximately 93,000,000 miles, this gives a figure of about 97 AU.

And yes, you can clearly see from the page that communication with Earth is still possible via the Deep Space Network.

Voyager 2 was about 78 AU from Sol on the same date.

== Mariner 11? ==

I seem to recall seeing somewhere that ''Voyager 1'' was initially designated Mariner 12 and Voyager 2 was Mariner 11.  It may have been from an article in &quot;Science&quot; around the time of the launches (1977).--[[User:Clemmentine|Clemmentine]] 01:23, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== I don't like this page ==

It is poorly written, as if everyone understands astronomical language. The links are shite, the order of facts is as if written by a lunatic (excuse the pun) and the link to the [[heliosheath]] which I found on the main page is a load of nonsense. Please, burn this page, I hate it. In fact I have had enough of Wikipedia, it has become a load of shit peddled by people who feel enlightened, a bit like advertising consultants. I was really optimistic at one point, as if the ''Foundation'' had come true, but with every passing day Wikipedia makes itself clearer - it is a good few gigabytes of utter rubbish.

I am a general, non-specialist reader and I like this page! I find it clear and interesting - which may very well indicate the extent of my ignorance. I do have one quibble that applies to much of Wikipedia, and that is the use the present tense and of words like &quot;currently&quot; without any indication of the date of writing. Surely it would be simple enough to add something like &quot;as of 16 September 2010&quot;, wouldn't it? [[User:Dawright12|Dawright12]] ([[User talk:Dawright12|talk]]) 10:15, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

Regarding tense, the article also uses quite a bit of past tense verbiage (&quot;The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments&quot;).  As the spacecraft is still in operation, shouldn't we use present tense?  Doesn't the information still apply?  It makes it sound like Voyager is a thing of the past.

Some answers hopefully someone can question (and add :-):
* It floats with anti-gravity forces driving it away from Earth.
* The satelite moves further and move further out in space meanwhile sending a signal back to the space-station at NASA.
* IF we will lose track of it, we don't know when, but I presume in a few years, at worst.

:I doubt that we know exactly where the spacecraft is, rather that we know where it should be (it's only significantly affected by the sun and it's own thrusters), and that along this specific line we point the [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/profiles_dsn.html DSN] antennas (Deep-Space Network), we get signal.  &quot;Losing track&quot; of it is a really grey area, We could probably plot where it will be in a few million years, courtsey of Sir Issac Newton, and not be off by much.  The craft communicates with it's high-gain antenna via DSN at a rate of 16b/s up, 160b/s down [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/index.html] (and a 26 hour ping :P).  &quot;How does it work&quot; is a bit vague, it's powered by the radioisotope generators as mentioned in the article, but how the Low-Energy Charged Particle detector works is, IMHO, overkill. [[User:Prometheus235|Prometheus235]] 01:12, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

--------------------------

:Well, presumably we have a pretty good idea where it is, simply by measuring the time taken for its signal to reach earth ! Also we know the direction where the signal is coming from - anonymous

::Also, by measuring the Doppler effects on the radio link between the Voyagers and the Earth, the velocities and accelerations of the Voyagers can be measured. Also, there is a far better way of measuring the distance to the Voyagers than simply measuring the time delay. Then, all of this information goes into a very complicated guidance and navigation system with big computers in the DSN. All of this is probably way beyond your intelligence level anyway, so never mind![[Special:Contributions/74.249.82.221|74.249.82.221]] ([[User talk:74.249.82.221|talk]]) 21:15, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

== Digital camera on board ==

Voyager took pictures of Jupiter, with a considerable good resolution. I would like to know how these pictures were made, as Digital Photography in a resolution like the Voyager camera hit commercial markets as late as 1999 - did the Voyager have a digital camera installed? thanks, [[user:Abdull|Abdull]]

:For a description of the detector technology, you might want to look at [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]].  It doesn't have a history section, but they were developed quite a while before becoming reasonable in digital cameras, because of price, and I think also because it was difficult to make them work well at room temperature.  Digital cameras also require electronics which became small and cheap enough only recently.  I'm not absolutely positive CCDs were developed before the Voyagers, but if not, they probably had something like a CCD but simpler. 03:13, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

: The article '''[[Voyager program]]''' describes the instruments.  It mentions it was a slowscan [[vidicon]] camera.  If memory serves me correctly, that is a vacuum-tube TV camera.  The plate upon which the image was focused built up a charge which was detected by a scanning electron beam.  For this application, the tube would be designed to hold an image for a while so long-exposure images could be formed.  Aha, I found a diagram; I'll update [[vidicon]].  The image was slowly scanned and recorded on tape in digital form, for later retransmission to Earth.  ([[User:SEWilco|SEWilco]] 04:01, 27 May 2005 (UTC))

::Hi SEWilco, great information you dug up! So, to correct common misbelief, it'll be good to mention it was NOT a CCD, but a [[vidicon]] that recorded the Voyager images. Do you have a link to the information source about the whole &quot;image acquiring and sending to earth&quot; process? I'd like to update the Voyager 1 section with this info. --[[User:Abdull|Abdull]] 5 July 2005 21:09 (UTC)

::: No, I don't have a source for the image handling.  My memory is that the digital tape recorder captured images along with other data, but I am not aware of a source which specifically states so.  ([[User:SEWilco|SEWilco]] 5 July 2005 22:10 (UTC))

::::The first space probe with a CCD (electronic digital) picture camera was the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)]]'' probe, originally-planned for launching in 1982, but actually launched - after a long series of delays - in 1989. As you can see, ''Galileo'' was well-after the two Voyagers.[[Special:Contributions/74.249.82.221|74.249.82.221]] ([[User talk:74.249.82.221|talk]]) 21:20, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

== Does the camera still work ==

If we mention the 1990 &quot;family portrait&quot; and the end-of-life times of specific instruments, we should also say whether the camera(s) (or other specific instruments) still work(s). So, does it? Would it be possible to take another &quot;family portrait&quot; or other photo and send it to earth? Is this not done to save energy? [[User:Multi io|Multi io]] ([[User talk:Multi io|talk]]) 00:29, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

:I believe that given the current distance out, and the resolution of a digital camera built a third of a century ago, another 'family portrait' would show nothing.  Except the sun itself, as a small bright spot.  Not much reason to take a picture when nothing would be visible.  Better to keep the instruments focused on possible new things to be learned.

Don't feel so special, humans are guilty of thinking they are greater then they really are.


If we kill each other, isn't it a scary thought that this is all that we have, our legacy, our gift to the races across the galaxy, maybe when any of our probes enter a new solar system, one of the probes lands on planet, and the natives end up revering the golden disk as a religious item, the holy grail of their planet?

== What about the ocean? ==

I think that this is a great accomplishment. I have great faith in the success of this project and the space program in general. But we know more about space than we do the ocean, on our own planet. We know little of giant squids, sea plants, and other things that we should probably research before it is too late. Maybe NASA or the Russian Space Association or someone could make a division that studies the ocean. Some of the same technology can be used underwater, I'm sure. I know I sound like some freakazoid wildlife advocate or something, but I think that we should concentrate on our own planet first.

Here's my ''ceterum censeo'': I am not happy with the use of billions. The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)|Manual of Style]] suggests to avoid the use of that word.

== Distance to the stars ==

&quot;It is not heading towards any particular star, but in 40,000 years it will to within 1.7 light years of the star AC+793888 in the Camelopardis constellation.&quot;
At its current speed, Voyager 1 takes about 17400 years to travel one light year. How is the quoted statement possible?

:I don’ know, but the statement comes from the fine folks [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html at NASA]. — [[User:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker]] [[User talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ]] 10:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

OK. I looked it up. The figures are right. It seems AC+79 3888 is moving relative to us. In 40,000 years the relevant distances will be approximately AC-Earth 2.9 ly, AC-Voyager 1.64 ly, Earth-Voyager 2.3 ly.
It's an odd statement though. Scale it down by making each light year a thousand miles, then say &quot;Over the course of the next 40,000 years Voyager One will, at a foot a day, bisect the US from west to east, going from San Francisco to Washington DC and pass within 1,600 miles of Nicaragua&quot;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
a gigameter is 1{{e|9}} ''meters''.  1{{e|9}} km is 1{{e|12}} meters, or terameters.  I've made that minimal change in the text, but I have another issue.  This is the first time I've ever used &quot;terameter&quot; in a sentence.  I think it's the first time I've ever ''seen'' &quot;terameter&quot; in a sentence.  I agree it's a perfectly acceptable SI prefixed unit, but I'm still a little startled when I see it.  I suppose I don't mind using it, but is there a reason I've never seen it in English text before?  Is it stylistically (as opposed to technically) correct? [[User:Co149|Co149]] 07:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

I suppose the primary subdivision, the 'meter', becomes a little insignificant once you get into distances that large. Either way I don't really think that style should come into it, where SI units and naming conventions are concerned. :) [[User:L3p3r|L3p3r]] 10:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)


===Terameter Error?===
I am uncertain if this observation is correct BUT : 

1) The speed of light (as per google) is : 299 792 458 m/s

2) Distance Given / Speed of Light = (15.80{{e|12}} m) / (299 792 458 m/s) = 52703.12704 (to 5 d.p)
This is the number of &quot;light seconds&quot; covered by Voyager 1, which is 14.6'''4''' light hours (where I take an hour to be 3600 seconds).  I am sure that the wiki calculation in the introduction is probably correct due to some potential oversight I have made - but would anyone care to comment on how the 14.62 light-hours results was obtained?

Would it also be prudent (from a purely academic point of view) to consider Voyager's average velocity as a percentage of the speed of light?  Since there are about 365*24=8760 hours in a year, then voyager has travelled about 14.62/8760=0.1671% of a LY =0.001671 LY over a (say) 31 year time period (going from 05/09/1977 to 07/03/2008 is about 11141 days).  So that's 0.1671%/31=0.005391%=0.00005391 the speed of light (ie: VERY slow).  At that speed, ignoring relativistic effects, Voyager would take 4.22/0.00005391 = 78278 years to reach Proxima Centauri (ie: 78.3 thousand years) IF it were going in that direction.

Would such calculations (at least ones relating Voyager's speed relative to the speed of light) be worth placing on the article?

::It is reasonable to calculate and show the Voyagers' average speeds as a fraction of the speed of light just to show how slowly they go - on an astronomical scale. &lt;br&gt;
Also, the S.I. (the metric system) has a pre-defined set of prefixes (multipliers) for the units that are meaningful whether that &quot;unit' has ever been seen in print or not. Let me name some of them. As an electrical engineer, I use all of them, and more people ought to learn them, too:&lt;br&gt;
On the large end, kilo: 10^3, mega: 10^6, giga: 10^9, tera: 10^12, 
where 10^3 = 1000, 10^6 = 1,000,000, 10^9 = 1,000,000,000, and so forth.&lt;br&gt; 
On the small end, milli: 10^-3, micro: 10^-6, nano: 10^-9, pico: 10^-12,
where 10^-3 = 1/1000, 10^-6 = 1/1,000,000, and so forth.&lt;br&gt;
So, one ought to undrstand the application of these whether you have seen them or not. Consider terabyte, terameter, and terahertz.&lt;br&gt;
Also, picogram, picometer, and picofarad.&lt;br&gt; 
Also, occasionally seen are deci = 1/10, centi = 1/100, deka = 10, hecto = 100, and rarely myria = 10,000.[[Special:Contributions/74.249.82.221|74.249.82.221]] ([[User talk:74.249.82.221|talk]]) 22:15, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

== '''farthest ''known''''' human-made object or just '''farthest''' ? ==

I removed the ''&quot;known&quot;'' qualifyer once again. Maybe other editors can give their opinion so we can come to a definitive version.

Personally I don't think it makes any sense. A hypothetical meteorite impact, blowing some human artefact into space and further than the current position of Voyager, would have to be so energetic that it couldn't possibly have been missed. We don't have any knowledge of any candidate event. And even IF such an outrageously unlikely event has taken place somewhere in the distant past, I still wouldn't think it justified the change.

Adding the ''&quot;known&quot;'' qualifyer gives an unwarranted impression of uncertainty. An artificial sense of mystery which we don't need. For all practical purposes, we can definitely say that the Voyager 1 is the most distant human made object [[User:JH-man|JH-man]] ([[User talk:JH-man|talk]]) 23:59, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
:An encyclopedia should represent the certainty of a stated fact.  Wikipedia uses this kind of language all the time, such as here:

:: ''In science, &quot;fact&quot; can only mean &quot;confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.&quot; I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.''

::Or in other words: at some point the &quot;certainty&quot; of a claim crosses a line, a line beyond which statements of doubt no longer fairly present the status of that claim. I think this is clearly the case here, and ''adding'' the qualifier &quot;known&quot; does more harm to the truth than ''leaving it out''. 

::There are two possibilities that would make the claim wrong:
::1)another spaceprobe has been launched by homo sapiens somewhere in the past and happens to be more distant at this time. This would either have to be a &quot;secret&quot; probe launched fairly recently, or one launched by an unknown ancient culture. The former is practically impossible because it would be almost impossible to hide, and because it would make no sense to hide it since prestige would be the biggest non-scientific incentive to launch the mission. The latter can only be true if we consider to completely rewrite the history of homo sapiens. Historical revisionism of some magnitude which would require immense amounts of evidence which are clearly lacking at this point.
::2)The possibility, as you stated, that something like an asteroid or comet impact blew human artefacts into space, and actually with enough energy to put them beyond Voyager 1's current position. First of all this is an extremely unlikely case. In written history absolutely no event of the required magnitude has happened. Secondly, I think the statement &quot;farthest human made object&quot; contains an implicit assumption that we're specifically talking about a device that was sent out there ''on purpose'', intentionally. A human achievement instead of some chance event.

== Change farthest manmade object to farthest functioning probe ==

The article says 
:Voyager 1 is the farthest manmade object from Earth, traveling away from both the Earth and the Sun at a relatively faster speed than any other probe.
I want to say that Voyager 1 has sent us signals at a greater distance than any other probe. Meaning the important part is Voyager 1 is sending signals not just that it is man-made object. If it were to stop sending us signals today it would become worthless dead probe. This could make a difference when Voyager 1 stops transmitting and if the New Horizons probe (even) sends a signal at a distance further away.

Therefore we could not be certain Voyager 1 is still the farthest manmade object. The only thing we know is where Voyager 1 stopped transmitting. We should not say Voyager 1 is farthest manmade object because after it stops transmitting its location can't be verified.

== AC+79 3888? ==

On this page it is claimed that AC+79 3888 is in the Ophiuchus constellation.  On the [[AC+79 3888]] page it is claimed that the star is in the Camelopardalis constellation.  The latter makes sense if only because the declination of the star (+79) indicates that it could hardly be in the Ophiuchus constellation (declination 0).  The mistake seems to stem from the fact that Voyager is indeed currently in the Ophiuchus constellation, but will eventually rendezvous with AC+79 3888. In other words, Voayger's declination will change over the course of the next ~40,000 years.  Regardless, AC+79 3888 is misplaced on this page.  Unless there's a good reason for this (I am not an astronomer, but this seems fairly logical), I will change this information in a few days (unless someone else does it first).

== Projection ==

I know Wikipedia isn't the place for speculation, but would it be possible to include a list of dates (estimate of the year or decade) of when Voyager 1 is expected to reach something? Like the Oort Cloud, for instance. This would certainly make this more interesting (it's interesting now, just saying). [[Special:Contributions/4.225.111.92|4.225.111.92]] ([[User talk:4.225.111.92|talk]]) 02:40, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
:If the Oort Cloud is 2000 au away. Then voyager will reach the Oort Cloud in about the year 2600.
:The article and NASA say 
::“Voyager 1 is not heading towards any particular star, but in about 40,000 years it will be within 1.6 light years of the star AC+79 3888 in the Camelopardalis constellation.”
:Then Voyager 1 is traveling 3.6 au per year. In 40,000 years it will be 144,000 au away. 1 au is 93,000,000 miles. So voyager 1 will be 13 trillion miles in 40,000 years. 13 trillion miles is 2.2 light years away. But AC+79 3888 is 17 light years away, not 2.2 light year away. Is somebody making a mistake? [[User:Mschribr|Mschribr]] ([[User talk:Mschribr|talk]]) 19:36, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

As I mentioned in an earlier post: (1) The star AC+79 3888 is moving relative to us. (2) Voyager is not heading towards this star. Imagine moving at about a metre (3.3 feet) a year. After 40,000 years you notice a mountain peak on the horizon to your left... [[Special:Contributions/92.23.132.241|92.23.132.241]] ([[User talk:92.23.132.241|talk]]) 10:51, 15 July 2009 (UTC)
::Now I see. Voyager 1 is moving at 17 km/second. AC+79 3888 is moving at 119 km/second. AC+79 3888 is moving 7 times faster than Voyager 1. So voyager 1 is standing still compared to AC+79 3888. Voyager 1 is not moving to AC+79 3888. But AC+79 3888 is moving to Voyager 1. That should be made clearer in the article about Voyager 1.

== Launch date	September 5, 1977 (11644 days ago)????????? ==

Um.......is it really smart to count how many days its been since Voyager was launched? Someone is going to have to constantly update it. I mean, if someone doesn't mind that then fine, but I think its be much easier and simplier to say:

Launch date	September 5, 1977 ( __ Years, __ Months, and __ days ago)

Yeah someone would still have to constantly update it....but still.  [[Special:Contributions/75.72.205.243|75.72.205.243]] ([[User talk:75.72.205.243|talk]]) 03:10, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

:No one needs to update it because the template {{tl|age in days|1977|09|05}} does it automatically.

== Voyager 1 Location and Trajectories Map ==

The article has a map showing the location and trajectory of Voyager 1. The map includes Pluto’s and Neptune’s orbits. Pluto’s and Neptune’s orbits are too far from Voyager 1 to give a good scale map. A Voyager 1 trajectory map should include objects with orbits that pass the location of Voyager 1. Such as detached objects Sedna, 2004 VN 112 and 2000 CR 105. A Voyager trajectory map would fit nicely inside the orbits of these detached objects.

== Current Article Structure ==

From the perspective of a relative outsider, the beginning of this article is sort of a mess.  New Horizons is introduced as if it's a known quantity, without any description within the article to help guide a new reader.  One could reasonably assume that a person reading an encyclopedia article about Voyager I would have no idea what New Horizons is.  Please make an effort to at least summarize the nature of any new concepts discussed in an article, especially in the introductory sections.

== Needs review ==

I saw the tag that [[User:Gamersedge|Gamersedge]] is recording this article, so decided to check the diagram of positions in [[Voyager 1#Current status]]. Its lines are over-long. Also the light time figures for both Pluto and Voyager were wrong and out of date respectively. I fixed the text figures but not the diagram. I suggest the rest of the article needs to be carefully reviewed. -[[User:84user|84user]] ([[User talk:84user|talk]]) 06:25, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

== Within a human lifespan? ==

The section on &quot;Current Activities&quot; says: &quot;Provided Voyager 1 doesn't collide with any stellar objects, the New Horizons space probe will never pass it within a human lifespan....&quot;

== The &quot;time elapsed&quot; is wrong. ==

The &quot;Mission duration&quot; in the sidebar claims a very precise (to the day) and wrong elapsed time since launch. Apparently this is hard-wired in. 

Cannot we use the Wiki tool that counts elapsed time (as for example when people's ages are automatically updated depending on when the page is accessed) to fix this problem? Wiki should not be giving an elapsed time for the mission that is over a year in error. [[User:Billjefferys|Bill Jefferys]] ([[User talk:Billjefferys|talk]]) 02:20, 16 December 2010 (UTC)

:If I am understanding correctly, you are confused about the difference between launch date and mission duration?  The difference the times is due to the fact that the primary mission only began as the spacecraft passed Jupiter.  The launch date tells how long ago the craft was launched, the mission duration tells how long science has been collected consistently which has been occurring for 31 years, 11 months, and 12 days as of this post.--[[User:Xession|Xession]] ([[User talk:Xession|talk]]) 05:53, 16 December 2010 (UTC)

;Wann genau Jahr Monat Tag Stunde Minute Sekunde am 05.September 1977 wurde Voyager 1 ins Universum von der Erde geschossen (ins Sonnensystem)?

Hello IP, this is the English Wikipedia, so posting questions in German is not the smart thing to do, as it forces me to answer you twice - once in German and once in English.
1) You asked when exactly (to the second) Voyager 1 was launched. I cannot answer that. 
2) You write something about how the distance Voyager 1 - Earth should be calculated by speed * flight time. This is in error; the speed of an object in space is never constant, as the gravitation of other objects (planets, the sun), particle density, solar wind etc. are influencing it. Distance can be measured rather precisely by the time a radio signal takes from earth to Voyager 1 and back. 
3) You ask whether there is any proof for the speed of Voyager 1, citing &quot;proof pictures by telescopes&quot;. Even if telescopes were able to make out something as small as Voyager 1 at its current distance (which they are not), they could not prove ''speed'' with a ''picture''. Again, the radio signal of Voyager 1 can be used to calculate speed relative to earth ([[Doppler effect]]).
4) You ask where exactly, relative to Earth, Voyager 1 is located. The article states that, as of 2008, &quot;Voyager 1 is in the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth&quot;. Any astronomical software (e.g. Stellarium) should be able to give more up-to-date info.
I hope this helps. If you have further questions, please contact a forum in a language you speak. -- [[User:DevSolar|DevSolar]] ([[User talk:DevSolar|talk]]) 12:41, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

:Hallo IP, das hier ist die englische Wikipedia. Hier Fragen in Deutsch zu stellen ist nicht klug, weil es mich zwingt, zweimal zu antworten - einmal in Deutsch und einmal in Englisch.
:1) Du fragst wann genau (auf die Sekunde) Voyager 1 gestartet wurde. Das kann ich nicht beantworten.
:2) Du schreibst das die Entfernung Voyager 1 - Erde aus Geschwindigkeit * Flugzeit berechnet werden müßte. Das ist ein Fehler; die Geschwindigkeit eines Objekts im All ist niemals konstant, da die Gravitation andere Objekte (Planeten, der Sonne), Teilchendichte, Sonnenwind etc. alle ihren Einfluß haben. Die Entfernung kann recht genau daraus errechnet werden, wie lange ein Radiosignal von der Erde zu Voyager 1 und zurück braucht.
:3) Du fragst ob es einen Beweis für die Geschwindigkeit von Voyager 1 gibt, und nennst &quot;Beweisfotos von Teleskopen&quot;. Selbst wenn Teleskope etwas so kleines wie Voyager 1 auf diese Entfernung sehen könnten (können sie nicht), könnten sie ''Geschwindigkeit'' nicht durch ein ''Foto'' beweisen. Wieder kann das Radiosignal von Voyager 1 benutzt werden, um die Geschwindigkeit relativ zur Erde zu messen ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopplereffekt Dopplereffekt]).

== Solar-wind detector question ==

I am wondering. In the Heliopause section it is stated that
&quot;Voyager 1's solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990.&quot;

Yet further down the article it is stated &quot;Since June 2010, detection of solar wind has been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. (heliopause)&quot;

If the solar-wind detector is not working, how is it being measured reliably at zero?

:I can't speak with certainty on this because I've yet to tracked down the papers discussing the disabling of Voyager instruments, however, I believe that statement in the Heliopause section is likely false.

== Current location ==

Should we expect to update the current location of Voyager 1 regularly? It seems to be excessive to make small adjustments in the current distance every few days. Anyone who is truly interested in an up-to-the-moment distance can easily go to the link provided. I don't see the point of updating it manually every few days, for the figure will be always somewhat outdated. Should we come to an agreement on how often to update it, or just rely on some interested editors to keep a watch on this? I can't think of any automated way of doing this.

== Speeds ==

(1) Article says &quot;Voyager 1's current relative velocity is 17.062  km/s ...&quot; This should be speed, not velocity.  More interestingly, it should say what this speed is relative to.  My choice would be the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF).&lt;ref&gt;http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/ICRF/&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) In any case, I think the value is wrong.  Using JPL Horizons &lt;ref&gt;http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons&lt;/ref&gt;, I get the speed on March 9th (00:00 UTC) to be 15.346 km/s relative to the sun, -12.092 km/s relative to the Earth, and 14.681 km/s relative to the ICRF.  Yes, we are actually getting closer to Voyager 1.

:For point 1, I might agree, however, relative velocity inherently gives a direction ''away'' from an object which is the only difference between velocity and speed. For point 2, the [http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html Voyager webpage] cites 3.6AU/year which translates to [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=538%2C552%2C334.4876+km%2Fyear+to+km%2Fs 17.07738249897 km/s].

== &quot;Current Status&quot; inconsistencies ==

# The current section says &quot;As of April 21, 2011, Voyager 1 was about 116.825 AU, or about 10,843,294,886 miles or about 0.00183 of a light-year from the Sun.&quot; However, Google calculator says that 116.825 AU = 10,859,571,600 miles, which differs from the given figure starting in the 4th decimal place. Differences should be limited to later positions since 116.825 AU has 6 significant figures. Google calculator also gives 116.825 AU as 0.00184733723 light-years, differing again from this figure. Google calculator's AU&lt;-&gt;miles conversion disagrees with the value listed at [[Astronomical Unit]] only in the 7th digit, so that can't explain the differences. The light-year conversion is especially off.
# The miles figure has 11 digits of precision, which is *incredibly* precise, yet the light-year figure only has 3. I'm deeply suspicious that we would have been able to calculate the distance--I suppose to the center of the earth?--to the nearest mile.
# I won't check the other pure conversions, but they may contain similar discrepancies.
# The section says &quot;This calculates as 3.599 AU per year, about 10% faster than Voyager 2. At this velocity, 73,600 years would pass before reaching the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, were the spacecraft traveling in the direction of that star.&quot; The [[Proxima centauri]] article lists it at a distance of 4.2 light-years, as does this article. At 3.599 AU per year, Google calculator figures the time frame as ~73,800 years, not 73,600. In a brief search I found disagreement in the distance--4.2, 4.22, or 4.3. The latter two make the discrepancy significantly larger.
# The section says &quot;Voyager 1 will need about 7800 years at its current velocity to travel one light year, therefore 40,000 years will pass before coming anywhere near other stars or planets.&quot; The 7800 figure makes absolutely no sense with the previous figures. 3.599 AU per year * 7800 years converts to about 0.44 light-years, when it should be precisely 1 light-year. The actual number should be about 17600. Perhaps a 1 got missed and other discrepancies conspired.
# Also, the &quot;therefore&quot; clause in the previous quote does not actually follow from the preceding clause. Later in the section it's explained that &quot;Voyager 1 is not heading towards any particular star, but in about 40,000 years it will pass within 1.6 light years of the star AC+79 3888 in the constellation Camelopardalis. That star is generally moving towards our Solar System at about 119 kilometers per second.&quot; That star's movement towards the spacecraft is utterly essential in arriving at the preceding conclusion. At first I thought it was just another discrepancy.

Shouldn't the whole section be merged into the Interstellar space, or a &quot;post-mission&quot; section. 4. It suffers from WP:RECENTISM.

I've done a major cleanup. Gone is the Voyager Golder Record (linked from [[Voyager program]]), and Jupiter and Saturn are now separate, although lack specific scientific results.

== Manmade vs. Humanmade ==

{{archivetop}}
Hi- i appreciate that my edit was seen to be in 'good faith', and i am not certain this is the right place to leave this comment (i've edited quite few Wiki pages, but have never i believe had a change 'reverted' before) -- i wonder why it is not 'necessary' to change 'manmade' to 'humanmade', when it is clear we are moving to a gender-neutral language, and this immediately sticks out like a sore thumb to someone reading the piece.  I just showed this edit to a female astronomer colleague and she was kind of amazed that anyone would take issue with this.
I hope this issue can be resolved amicably.
Thx-

:Hello. You may be right, [[WP:Gender-neutral language]] states in the introduction:
:&quot;Examples of non-neutral language that can often be easily avoided are: [...] ''man'' to stand for both genders in general, either as a separate item (''man's greatest discoveries''), a prefix (''mankind, manmade''), or a suffix (''businessman, fireman'').&quot;  Cheers, [[User:BatteryIncluded|BatteryIncluded]] ([[User talk:BatteryIncluded|talk]]) 20:20, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
::Okay, so I see this issue has already been raised. This article has for long enough used the pefectly acceptable 'man-made' description. [[User:BatteryIncluded]] has invented a new word 'humanmade' and insists on using it here, on the strength of a Wikipedia essay on so-called gender-neutral language. We are not obliged to use such language here, especially when it sounds ridiculous, as 'humanmade' clearly does. What's it supposed to tell us, that the thing was made by humans rather than monkeys?

::As far as this discussion goes, I lodge that mankind and human mean relatively the same thing, albeit one is more termed for sex of the race rather than race as a whole.

:My take is that even if the term is used in some reliable source, it doesn't change much. Just because a source uses a neologism to describe something doesn't mean we then start using the neologism to the abandonment of more common terms. We aren't shackled to the exact language that sources use, and in fact may be required to use different wording at times (often due to copyright or NPOV concerns).

We can move forward if we focus on the object, not on the makers, and use instead:
*spacecraft
*probe
*artificial object

:: You're using an essay as the basis for the word change, [[WP:Gender-neutral-language]] is an '''essay''' written by ''one or more Wikipedia contributors'' as the basis for this change? There is a content dispute because 'man' and 'mankind' are the more dominant in [[WP:RS|reliable sources.]] It is the more used phrasing. What do you think Armstrong meant when he said &quot;One step for man, one giant leap for mankind?&quot; He was referring to humanity. &quot;Man&quot; and&quot;Mankind&quot; are synonyms for the human race and in effect, are not gendered words. I am also not refusing or denying that NASA said 'human-made', but I am rejecting the notion that they did it prominently.

*Do we censor Muhammed's article, because it may contain substance that Muslim's find unsuitable? Even overtly so? What if there are million of them who feel that the whole article should be deleted?

I'm not going to edit war, which is why I am going to take a consensus vote, instead. [[WP:CONSENSUS]] is one of the strongest policies in which Wikipedia functions.

A protracted edit war occurred as a result of this edit, which in any case had no consensus whatsoever. I don't suggest we slavishly stick to a certain word such as man-made, but I object to such words being removed from an article simply because some people object to them.

Let me check what the page now says, and maybe try to figure this out.. [[User:Mssgill|Mssgill]] ([[User talk:Mssgill|talk]]) 07:14, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

Ok -- looks like there is no &quot;manmade&quot; in the article anymore (except in one case where it's a quote of an original article that is referenced), so from the votes above i gather the &quot;human-made&quot; wording kind of won the day in the end.  Even though i didn't read everything in the discussion yet, i saw some strongly worded support for 'my' POV, which i appreciated, but i *do* want to argue for civility first and foremost in Wiki discussions, everywhere online (and IRL too).  I believe it matters, in public discourse, and is something that e.g. Pres. Obama has really had as a central them his whole career, and continues to reiterate.  
I did change my 'vote' in the resolution at the bottom from &quot;no opinion state&quot; to &quot;support&quot; (for the change to gender-neutral wording).  Interesting process, indeed.  Though i don't edit a lot of Wiki articles to any degree, having been involved in a bit of this, i am even more glad i make my small regular yearly contribution to Wikipedia. :-)

*Okay, I am having a hard time telling whether this dispute has been resolved, so just in case, I shall give my view. Considering that ''human-made'' is a neologism, but clearly has the same meaning as made by humanity, I think that should be enough to clear up the issue. I would be in support of either made by humans or made by humankind/humanity, whichever is preferred by others more. If this discussion ''has'' been closed, then it would be best that it be marked as such - thanks. [[User:Dustin V.

::{{ping|Dustin V. S.}}, it appears fairly quiet now, but it was very active, and not that much time has passed to verify true silence. The article has been changed according to the best understanding developed here. I just think a couple of weeks will say definitively. My view of the outcome is that the community rejected the man vs. human argument because, being motivated by political correctness, it undermined any future stability for the wording. I believe it was felt that the dispute could then arise again anytime later. Instead, the decision seems to be to refer to Voyager 1 as a &quot;spacecraft&quot; instead of &quot;(hu)man-made object&quot; or the like, thus side-stepping the political correctness issue entirely, and providing the desired article stability.

:::Oh. Okay then. If the issue comes up again though, I'll be here. [[User:Dustin V.

::::Yeah, me too. Nobody wins these arguments; that's why everybody always comes back: looking for the chance that never comes. Political correctness is the pits. [[User:Evensteven|Evensteven]] ([[User talk:Evensteven|talk]]) 00:47, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::: I ceased arguing for my point because due to the !voting, I'm in the minority, and ultimately, [[WP:CONSENSUS|majority rules.]] Even if I'm completely right, that's how it goes. [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 22:44, 13 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::: This addendum makes it clear that you have not ceased arguing: one more parting shot. And it is the arguing itself that is wrong, since &quot;rightness&quot; is a POV no matter which side one takes. I couldn't care less that we have a differing view on &quot;man/human&quot;. I do care when such arguments set themselves to disrupt WP editing. And while we're at it, [[WP:NOTDEMOCRACY|Wikipedia is not a democracy]]. We may poll, but we do not vote. Majorities do not rule; only consensus does. And 50.1% does not constitute a consensus ever. And neither does 9 against 1 if there are reasoned discussions still going on. But discussion involves being open to reason, and not just to reason but to serious consideration of another's viewpoint and what it is based upon. Anyone who considers him/her self to be completely right about something, whatever it is, is not discussing, but arguing only. Arguing is disruptive, whereas discussion is the breath and life of WP decision-making. Even though my teeth are clenched right now, I am able to tell you quite civilly that your comment above is not constructive, and to ask you to cease and desist. There is nothing incivil in insisting upon the principles on which WP editing is based and that they be respected. Neither do I need to hide behind false rules of courtesy or political correctness or sweet demeanor or any other type of social coercion when they are threatened. I am attacking your argument, now with vigor, but I am not attacking you. Kindly look and see the difference, and then perhaps you will understand that it is not enough simply to obey rules. What is needed is to be constructive, whatever it takes. Pot shots are not constructive. We do not need more arguing about POV!

:::::::: I was referring to [[WP:IDHT]] that policy, which is what got me started arguing massively against now known consensus. Numerous other editors have contributed to this argument, and when I'm in a 1:3 ratio for losing, that can be attributed as consensus for that ratio. Note that I never considered myself completely right. I believe in this [[WP:TRUTH]] essay, that we go by the sources, which is what I've argued but I've never considered myself completely right. I was simply supposing that if I was, and consensus was nearly 18 editors against me, a policy against frivolous discussions may be invoked to simply stop the 'arguing' that you put it. That's what I'm seeing here that is close to. ''I am able to tell you quite civilly that your comment above is not constructive, and to ask you to cease and desist.'' is a personal attack, which I am going to refer to you [[WP:NPA]]. Anybody saying [b]any[/b] comment is nonconstructive is attacking that person, (unless blatant vandalism) and I am not going to stand for it. I'm sick of it, honestly. Now back to the main point, the discussion. As I can see that I'm not going to win on this, I'm going to cede my position.

:::::::::Unless the user's intentions were to attack you, then I do not consider that point valid (on the personal attack); perhaps Evensteven is wrong, it matters not here. This discussion should be closed off because it is going nowhere. So I would suggest that neither of you make any further comments. Thank you. [[User:Dustin V.
