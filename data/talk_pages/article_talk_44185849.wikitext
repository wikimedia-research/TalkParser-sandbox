[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Seahorseruler|Seahorseruler]]. An edit you recently made to [[:Schenck v. United States]] seemed to be a test and has been removed. If you want more practice editing, the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] is the best place to do so. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Seahorseruler|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-test-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-test1 --&gt;[[User:Seahorseruler|&lt;span style='color:#1A2BBB'&gt;'''Seahorseruler'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Seahorseruler|(Talk Page)]] [[Special:Contributions/Seahorseruler|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:25, 22 October 2014 (UTC)
