==No apparent relation to Wilhelm==
I was searching Google for [[Wilhelm Reich]] and I found this guy. This guy, Edward, seems to have been referred to a lawyer by [[Mildred Edie Brady]]. Both Edward and Mildred Brady worked for Consumers Union. Mildred Brady wrote about Wilhelm Reich. I found no relationship between Edward Reich and Wilhelm Reich - their sharing a name and connection to Mildred Brady seems to be a coincidence.
