== Your recent edits ==

Hello. Just wondering what your source is on all these edits? Cheers. [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 12:49, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

from www.soccerassociation.com

:Well, I don't have a subscription, so I can't fact check, but ok. Thanks friend. Happy editing. [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 12:59, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

I'm new to this. Is this ok? Have an interst in football stats and saw that i can update quite a few

:Yes. Indeed. As long as the figures are correct, good job. Keep going. :) Anything you need, just ask. [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 13:06, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

I see that you have created lots of new articles, generally with only a single external link as a source.  Please ensure that you are aware of our [[WP:V|verifiability]] policy, especially in regards to [[WP:BLP|living people]] and try to always [[WP:CITE|cite]] at least one [[WP:RS|reliable]] reference inline, rather than just the external link.  Thanks.  [[User:The-Pope|The-Pope]] ([[User talk:The-Pope|talk]]) 01:02, 25 June 2011 (UTC)
==[[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Katuku Tshimanga]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Katuku Tshimanga]] has been [[WP:BLPPROD|proposed for deletion]] because under Wikipedia policy, all '''[[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]]''' created after March 18, 2010, must have at least one [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]] that directly supports material in the article. 

If you created the article, please don't take offense. Instead, consider improving the article. For help on inserting references, see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]] or ask at [[Wikipedia:Help desk]]. Once you have provided at least one [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]], you may remove the {{tl|prod blp}} tag. '''Please do not remove the tag unless the article is sourced.''' If you cannot provide such a source within ten days, the article may be deleted, but you can {{#ifexist:Katuku Tshimanga|request that it be undeleted|[[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request that it be undeleted]]}} when you are ready to add one.&lt;!-- Template:ProdwarningBLP --&gt; [[User:Ariconte|Ariconte]] ([[User talk:Ariconte|talk]]) 05:24, 28 June 2011 (UTC)

== Edit summary ==

Hi there, many thanks for your recent edits to Belgian football stats, but please remember to try and include an edit summary in future. More information can be found at [[Help:Edit summary]]. Regards, [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 14:51, 29 July 2011 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Mijuško Bojović]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Mijuško Bojović]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''Article about a footballer who fails [[WP:GNG]] and who has not played in a fully pro league.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Mijuško Bojović|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 18:31, 17 September 2011 (UTC)

Under [[Wikipedia:BLPPROD#Objecting|Wikipedia policy]], this newly created '''[[WP:BLP|biography of a living person]]''' will be deleted unless it has at least one reference to a [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]] that directly supports material in the article. 

If you created the article, please don't be offended. Instead, consider improving the article. For help on inserting references, see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners|Referencing for beginners]], or ask at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]]. Once you have provided at least one [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]], you may remove the {{tl|prod blp}} tag. '''Please do not remove the tag unless the article is sourced.'''
