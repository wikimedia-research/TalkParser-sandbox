[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Kolbasz|Kolbasz]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/Tangopower|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Lilith in popular culture]] because it did not appear constructive. If you would like to experiment, you can use the [[WP:sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Kolbasz|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt; [[User:Kolbasz|Kolbasz]] ([[User talk:Kolbasz|talk]]) 18:35, 2 August 2013 (UTC)
