Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added {{#if:The Sinned Knight|to the page [[:The Sinned Knight]]}} do not comply with our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines for external links]] and have been removed. [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the {{#if:The Sinned Knight|[[talk:The Sinned Knight|article's talk page]]|article's talk page}} before reinserting it.

If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.
:The external links I reverted were matching the following [[regex|regex rule(s)]]: rule: '\bmyspace\.com' (link(s): http://www.myspace.com/sinnedknight) .  If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[blog]], [[forum]], [[free web hosting service]], or similar site, then please check the information on the external site thorougly.	Note that such sites should probably not be linked to if they contain information that is in violation of the creators [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT|copyright]] (see [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT#Linking to copyrighted works|Linking to copyrighted works]]), or they are not written by a recognised, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]].	Linking to sites that you are involved with is also strongly discouraged (see [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]]).
