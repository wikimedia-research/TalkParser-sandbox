== IMDb ==

The &quot;Plot&quot; section is word-for-word identical to the plot description in IMDb. Even if the author is the same (I didn't check), this does not look OK. --[[User:Bonzi|bonzi]] ([[User talk:Bonzi|talk]]) 14:43, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

== Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes ==

Seems a little redundant to have both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes links listed. Both sites are just aggregating critic opinions - many of which overlap. [[User:BigBrightStars|BigBrightStars]] ([[User talk:BigBrightStars|talk]]) 02:08, 3 March 2009 (UTC) 


== Reviews ==

A good descriptive review that might help anyone else trying to rephrase (quotes on IMDB page are useful too) but not from a well known site so maybe not an ideal citation.
