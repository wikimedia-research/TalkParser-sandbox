== Speedy deletion nomination of Ventom ==

Hello Albertosthewilliyono,

I wanted to let you know that I just tagged [[Ventom]] for deletion, because it seems to be [[Wikipedia:Promotion|promotional]], rather than an encyclopedia article.

If you feel that the article shouldn't be deleted and want more time to work on it, you can &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title={{urlencode:Talk:Ventom}}&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+page+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+ contest this deletion]'''&lt;/span&gt;, but please don't remove the speedy deletion tag from the top.

You can leave a note on [[User_talk:Samuell1616|my talk page]] if you have questions. [[User:Samuell1616|One life to live ]] ([[User talk:Samuell1616|talk]]) 18:14, 18 February 2015 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from [[:Ventom]], a page you have created yourself. If you believe the page should not be deleted, you may contest the deletion by clicking on the button that says: '''Contest this speedy deletion''' which appears inside the speedy deletion notice. This will allow you to make your case '''''on the article's [[Talk:Ventom|talk page]]'''''. Administrators will consider your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page.

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Ventom]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about an organization or company, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please read more about [[Wikipedia:The answer to life, the universe, and everything|what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Ventom|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 18:32, 18 February 2015 (UTC)
