'''Khomasdal''' is a suburb of [[Namibia]]'s capital of [[Windhoek]] in the [[Khomas|Khomas Region]]. Founded as Windhoek's residential area for [[Coloured]] people, Khomasdal {{As of|2010|alt=still}} is primarily composed of Coloured people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/2008/March/national/08EDB70818.html Community dreams of a new Khomasdal] by Denver Isaacs, [[The Namibian]], 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the City of Windhoek announced the construction of an informal market in Khomasdal. The market will give the Khomasdal community the opportunity to generate their own income and even create more jobs in the process. Since then the Market has been finished and is situated on the corner of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] streets in Khomasdal.

Khomasdal is home to the [[Windhoek College of Education]], one of four national colleges of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wce.edu.na/page.php?p=about Windhoek College of Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
