I have made a few minor edits to this page - look forward to any feedback - my first ever Wikipedia edit - any help and guidance appreciated.--[[User:Neil Crump|Neil Crump]] ([[User talk:Neil Crump|talk]]) 22:54, 9 August 2011 (UTC)

In addition, I have ordered two secondary reference books so that I can add verifiable references and further information to this article.--[[User:Neil Crump|Neil Crump]] ([[User talk:Neil Crump|talk]]) 12:43, 16 August 2011 (UTC)

:I've added an image - the logo of the organisation. I've also assessed the article as 'start' class - see above. [[User:Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry|The Cavalry]] ([[User talk:Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry|Message me]]) 19:55, 13 September 2011 (UTC)
