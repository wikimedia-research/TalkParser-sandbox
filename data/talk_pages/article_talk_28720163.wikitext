The article [[Cocaine Girl]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''Non-notable unreleased song.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Cocaine Girl|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist.  The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion process]] can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; — [[User:Explicit|&lt;font color=&quot;B22222&quot;&gt;'''ξ'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Explicit|&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;xplicit&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:02, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
