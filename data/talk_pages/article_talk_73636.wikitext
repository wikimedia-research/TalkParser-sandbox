== What do you think? ==
This page is intended to make mathematical articles more readable for mathematical beginners.  What do you Wikimaticians think about it? --[[User:Rade Kutil|Rade]] &lt;small&gt;20 Aug 2002&lt;/small&gt;

This talk is all about visual appearances. I'm a non-mathematician attempting to create alt text for images of math formulae and need examples of how to verbalize or linearize them in natural language. The explanation column for each symbol in the table should include a natural language verbalization of the example in question, not just an explanation of it. How would one mathematician read the formula over the phone to another mathematician, perhaps a stranger, using best practice terminology, is what I'm after. For example, I'm having difficulty in trying to apply the &quot;sum over ... from ... to ... of&quot; given with the sigma/summation definition in the table to a very fancy-looking pair of formulae that place the symbol in different places, one covering an entire fraction, the other covering only the numerator part of a fraction.

John Knouse apparently has trouble seeing these symbols properly on Netscape 4.7, and I can't see them on IE 6.0. We really need to get some kind of help page for how to display math symbols, because neither of these browsers is all that old, and seeing math symbols shouldn't be a pain in the ass for wikipedians.

In my case right now, I think the trouble is that I don't have the right fonts installed. I tried to go to http://www.microsoft.com/typography//fontpack/default.htm
to download the Microsoft &quot;web fonts&quot;, which have resolved many of my past web font troubles, but they have discontinued the free downloads there.

Does anyone know where one can download the right fonts? I think it has to be a unicode font with symbols in the right range, but I don't off hand know what that range is, and my current connection is too slow to just try downloading things at random.

It might be useful to add a column telling the reader how to produce these symbols. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 08:32 Sep 4, 2002 (PDT)

Maybe, it is better to create a page in the Wikipedia name space for this purpose (if there isn't already one) and put a link in the article. --[[User:Rade Kutil|Rade]]

Yup: [[wikipedia:How does one edit a page]] contains a list of math symbols and their HTML entities. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

Axel, what do you mean that the leftwards arrows aren't used?
I see them all the time!
Heck, I use them myself.
&amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 07:45 Sep 18, 2002 (UTC)

You mean for functions? f: X &lt;- Y ? I have never seen that in my life. It certainly doesn't occur in Wikipedia anywhere. Or do you mean in logic? I would venture a guess that there are no left implication arrows in Wikipedia anywhere either. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

I have seen both of these, the function symbol often in literature related to category theory (and not just in commutative diagrams, but inline with the colon).
An example where this is useful (in a variety of contexts) is
:&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; &amp;larr; &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; &amp;sube; &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
to indicate a partial function &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; with domain &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;.
This is clearer than either
:&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; &amp;sube; &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; or
:&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; &amp;supe; &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;,
at least in my opinion (and apparently in others').
That said, the question becomes whether we should document such usage if it's not used in Wikipedia.
I think that we should, since it's easy to grasp and might end up being used in the future.
However, I'm not 100% convinced of this.

&amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 05:05 Sep 19, 2002 (UTC)

Well, since this page is directed at beginners, I think we should include only relevant symbols. People who read these category texts can probably figure out what the left arrows mean, for anybody else it's just information overload. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

All right, but you agree that the moment that it shows up in a basic Wikipedia article, then it shows up here.
(And shows up fairly, of course; I won't stick an example in just to spite you ^_^.)

The question of undisplayable characters in many popular browsers is, IMO, best addressed by creating graphics. A drawback is that it is too hard to make them in a variety of point sizes, so they must be made to fit the average context. I made such a character, &quot;[[Image:Del.svg]]&quot;, and use it in several articles. [[User:David spector|David]] 22:12 Dec 27, 2002 (UTC)

:IMO this question is '''not''' best addressed by creating graphics.  Apart from the drawback you mentioned, the use of graphics is more complicated than the use of character entities.  This reduces the ease of use which is a basic idea of Wikipedia.  Another drawback is that in the mid-future all browser will display these characters and the re-substitution will be a lot of work.  A better idea would be to suggest a software feature that translates the entities into graphics if the user sets their preferences so.  In this way, proper character sizes could be chosen.  --[[User:Rade Kutil|Rade]]

:We now have TeX markup on Wikipedia: &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;. problem solved -- it generates PNG images or HTML, depending on user prefs and complexity. In the future, as more browsers a re smarter, it will generate more HTML or MathML. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 19:37 Jan 6, 2003 (UTC)

Unfortunately, this solution does not work well. Look at the above paragraph with a browser and OS that do not support the &quot;nabla&quot; entity for &quot;[[Image:Del.svg]]&quot;, and you will see problems: the background is white instead of transparent, and it is about 50% too large (at least, on my computer). It was a very good idea, though. [[User:David spector|David]] 21:36 Jan 7, 2003 (UTC)

== Rejigging table ==

I would like to rejig the table, in part to get rid of those ridiculous H1 tags which someone has employed to make the left-hand column larger, and in part to make the layout more logical, giving more space to the larger items. How does the following look:

:Your version looks better to me. I always hated those extraneous lines in the &quot;symbol&quot; column. Some thoughts, you might want to consider adding some cellpadding, say cellpadding=3?

== several omissions ==

This table does not do anything for dot or cross products of vectors, it lacks the superset symbol and doesn't do the funtion operators like composition. Where is the vector &quot;harpoon&quot; arrow or the colon used in ratios and odds? &quot;Therefore&quot; and &quot;since&quot; symbols are missing. The symbols for Irrational numbers, Imaginary numbers and Counting numbers (Ie natural numbers without 0) are not there. The article in general needs some serious cleanup too. I will do all this given time however, my times is quite limited. --[[User:Sunborn|&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-weight:normal;color:grey;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;metta]]&lt;/font&gt;, [[User_talk:Sunborn| '''&lt;font style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;he&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt; S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;unborn&lt;/font&gt;''']] [[Special:Emailuser/Sunborn |&lt;font size=+1 style=&quot;color:Green;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x2638;&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:26, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Printing ==

It would be incredibly useful for people to be able to print out this page. When I try to print this page I get muddled tables - pages break in the middle of cells, the top left edge of cells which occur at the top of a page is left out, some symbols don't show up.Is it possible (using CSS or some other method)to tell the printer that certain things (like table cells) are inviolable?  Then you could set something up such that the whole table gets broken up into smaller tables (depending on where the end of a given page is, which I presume is variable across different platforms/setups) and the rule would be: divide table cells so that only the line between two large cells (i.e. the cells which contain the symbols, and which correspond to individual entries) may be interpreted as a breakable point in the table. With CSS I would think you could get the table to construct itself dynamically that way, assuming that CSS knows anything about or can account for the behavior of printers. As for some symbols not showing up in printing, I can't fathom why, it shows up fine in my browser, and the omitted symbols are not limited to symbols which occur at page breaks. Also, it only seems to affect the large symbols at the beginnings of each entry, so if anyone thinks they have an idea what this kind of problem sounds like, please fix.  Note for testing purposes, I'm using Mozilla firefox. Things may (possibly) behave differently with different browsers. --Unknown

:The table seems to print just fine using Internet Explorer 7.0 Beta, and most likely with the (stable) 6.0 release also. --{{User:ABelani}} 3:54, 9-Feb-2006 (UTC)

== Inclusions == 
Does pi really belong here? It is the only constant in the table. If pi is here, why not 0?

:Well for one, zero is number. But you have the right idea. There is at least one mathematically derived constant, e. So it would be interesting to know if pi would fit the bill of a mathematical symbol?--{{User:Sunborn/si}} 03:52, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

[[:Template:MathSymbols]] - starting a quick reference template. -[[User:Stevertigo|==S]][[User_talk:Stevertigo|V]] 20:07, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

If Pi is in there, shouldn't the number &quot;e&quot; be in there as well? And perhaps (yet less relevant because less frequently used) Phi? I'd include them myself but as this is a rather essential article, and i'm rather clumsy :p [[User:Fisheke|Fisheke]] 02:37, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

:Yeahhh hmmm well the letter &quot;e&quot; is a symbol-- not a constant.  However, Euler's number, which is written using the letter &quot;e&quot; is a constant-- this is kind of a poor distinction, but it avoids having to put rather pointless descriptions for the numerals 1-9, which are symbols.  With constant values.  I think the worry lies in whether common variable names should go in there, too, because (using phi as an example) phi is commonly used as either an angle or as a pseudo-ratio (how precise is phi?). I think there should be a completely seperate table altogether for those, but linked obviously to this one, so the wikireader will think &quot;oh, wait, maybe I'm looking for a CONSTANT &lt;nowiki&gt;(/variable),&lt;/nowiki&gt; not a SYMBOL...&quot;  I'm also complaining quietly that we SHOULD have pictures (.png, .svg, whatever) because a lot of these are not in the &quot;basic Unicode set&quot; or whatever it's called, and (IMHO) unicode is so wierdly organized that it should be avoided (i.e. everything is scattered, e.g. the accented &quot;e&quot;'s are seperated (grave/otherwise)).  Eh be sure to tell me if I'm being mean to unicode, though... I might be a little too critical, because I'm thinking that someday the unicode characters will be reordered and then replacing those numbers WILL be hard-- I've concluded that replacing pictures with their respective unicodes is probably an easier transition than making everybody download special character sets or using TeX (though TeX is kinda pretty and is a neat idea as far as I understand it). [[User:Nicholasnice|Nick]] 20:43, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

:: If we have pi we should also have e, phi, i, and any other symbols that are used to represent numbers. Personally I don't think any of them should be in there.

== &quot;empty set&quot; and &quot;null set&quot; ==

I reverted, a recent edit which changed the entry in the explanation column for the empty set from:
:''{{unicode|&amp;empty;}} means the set with no elements.''
to:
: ''{{unicode|&amp;empty;}} means the set with no elements, called a &quot;null set&quot;.''

This edit is problematic since although the empty set ''is'' sometimes also called ''the'' &quot;null set&quot; (there is only ''one'' empty set) the term &quot;a null set&quot; usually refers to a set with measure zero (see [[null set]]). In any case, the explanation column, is just to explain what the symbol means, not to give additional information.

== Editorial notes ==

The following two editorial notes were moved from the article to here

:If some of these symbols are used in a Wikipedia article that is intended for beginners, it may be a good idea to include a statement like the following, (below the definition of the subject), in order to reach a broader audience:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;''This article uses [[table of mathematical 
symbols|mathematical symbols]].''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:The article [[wikipedia:How to edit a page]] contains information about how to produce these math symbols in Wikipedia articles.

== Some thoughts ==

* It might be worthwhile breaking the table up to make editing easier
* is the square-root sign also used more generally, to mean &quot;if you do function B twice, then that's the same as doing function A once'?
* the &quot;not&quot; function is also used in [[boolean algebra]], as well as [[propositional logic]]
* where's dot product and cross product? What about that wedge product thing, which I have never understood?
* there should be an entry for +/-
* there should be an entry for the delta symbol, meaning change in
* there should be an entry for the forcing symbol &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;

Hi, I wasn't logged in, but I added the &lt;&lt;  and &gt;&gt; for &quot;much less than and much greater than&quot;.   I also added &lt;&gt; for inequality since it is commonly used in typing &quot;non-strict&quot; inequalities on a keyboard. However, there is a cell in the table now under &quot;Inequalities&quot; that says &quot;everywhere&quot; (meaning that the symbol is used everwhere).  The problem is, I can't seem to get that word vertically centered in the cell.  No idea why??  I tried valign, but it didn't seem to work.

Either those two sets are equal or not, it is not something which can be &quot;not always true&quot;. In this case the two sets ''are'' equal.

:It is true that the equation |a|∈&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; is true for all a∈&lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;. However, the main point is that, if we try to define &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt; using this equation, we do not know which values of 'a' to check, to see if they satisfy that equation.
:Like Fredrik says, if we check a=3+4i to see if it satisfies the constraints, we have |3+4i| = sqrt(3^2+4^2) = sqrt(9+16) = sqrt(25) = 5. 5 is a member of &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;. Therefore |3+4i| is a member of &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;. Therefore 3+4i is a member of the given set.
:In other words, the first definition is too vague. If we wanted to specify which values of a to check, we would have to mention Z or Q or R, which makes this definition much more clumsy.

:The second definition is much better, since it directly specifies the set of values which a can take.

==The identity symbol==

As a pedantic logician, I am unhappy with the explanation of the identity symbol given in the table. The formula '1+1=2' does not mean that 2 and 1+1 represent the same thing - it means that 2 and 1+1 ARE the same thing. The number two, after all, is not a symbol, and does not represent anything. Perhaps the writer intended ' 'x=y' means that 'x' and 'y' represent the same thing or quantity'. However, this is wrong too, for it fails to apply when 'x' and 'y' are being used as variables rather than proper names. I suggest: ' 'x=y' means that x and y are one and the same thing or quantity'.

::Since the article is about symbols, wouldn't the statement in question refer to the 2 strings of SYMBOLS &quot;1+1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; as representing the same quantity when the symbol &quot;=&quot; is placed between them?  Obviously the two strings are not the same; the first has 3 elements, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;+&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, while the other has only one element, &quot;2&quot;.  However, since the two strings are well-ordered, they each have the power to represent something in the real world.  It so happens that they each represent the SAME thing, the quantity we humans know as &quot;two&quot;. In order to communicate that relationship between these two VERY DIFFERENT STRINGS OF SYMBOLS, we use the symbol &quot;=&quot;.  [[User:Capitalist|capitalist]] 02:15, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

It is of course true that '1+1' and '2' have the same referent. However, one should not define identity by saying that 'x=y' is true iff 'x' and 'y' have the same referent. As I said, this definition fails when 'x' and 'y' are being used as variables rather than names. Consider for example the following statement of the 'symmetry of identity':

(for all x)(for all y)(If x=y then y=x)

Here 'x' and 'y' are not being used as names. They have no referents, and so the proposed definition fails to apply. The point is discussed in the opening of the third lecture of Kripke's Naming and Necessity.

::I would have to disagree that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are not being used as names in the statement of identity.  It's true that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are being used as variables in the two universal quantifiers at the beginning of the statement, but the statement would be meaningless if it did not imply the assignment of a specific value to the two variables in the conditional to which the quantifiers apply.  When we say (If x=y then y=x), we are saying if effect, &quot;Find the referent of &quot;x&quot;.  Do you have it?  Good.  Now find the referent of &quot;y&quot;. OK, now that you have two individual, specific, constant(non-variable), very concrete real-world values in mind, tell me if the first is equal to the second.  It is?  Then according to this statement of identity, I can conclude that the second value is equal to the first as well.&quot;   The purpose of a universally quantified statement is to say something general which can be applied to all possible SPECIFIC cases.  The variable stops being a variable and starts being a name when you get past the quantifiers and into the propositional part of the statement itself.  

::Of course this is all a quibble on the underlying philosophy of logic.  My view (which is probably in the minority) is that logic is not simply a word game or a self-consistent system of rules for the manipulation of symbols.  Logic is a tool which allows real human beings to communicate in a more precise way about the real world in which they really live.  Therefore, every term, variable, string, and symbol refers to something that really exists, or else it's meaningless.  I'm not familiar with Kripke, but his view may differ.  

::At any rate, this Wikipedia article is like logic; it's meant to help people do something...not to confuse them.  To change the statement about the equality symbol to &quot;'x=y' means that 'x' and 'y' are the same thing&quot; is not only meaningless and confusing, but demonstrably untrue.  &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are certainly not the same thing.  They occupy two different locations in the alphabet and their ASCI codes are different.  However, understood as SYMBOLS, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can certainly REPRESENT the same thing.  That's what symbols do; they represent real things.  But we shouldn't confuse them with the real things which they represent.  [[User:Capitalist|capitalist]] 03:52, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

You have miscopied my proposed definition. You rightly criticise the proposed definition &quot;'x=y' means that 'x' and 'y' are the same thing&quot;. However, this definition has inverted commas where mine had none. I doubt that the point is really important enough to merit much continued discussion. Either one of us is in error; perhaps a third person could spot the mistake!

==Algebraic Multiplication==

It is common for a dot or asterisk (*) to be used in place of the cross (X) in algebra due to X being the most common variable.

== &lt; and &gt; vs. &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; ==
In the table, the symbols &lt; and &gt; and the symbols &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are not only placed under the same mathematical category, but are actually in the same &quot;symbol section&quot;. These two symbols represent two very different ideas. &lt; and &gt; mean strictly less than or greater than, something purely algorithmic. A computer can analyse two numbers and determine if one is greater than the other. On the other hand, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are &quot;informal&quot; symbols, they don't have a strict mathematical meaning. The property of ''x'' being ''much greater'' than ''y'' is a matter of opinion and has no algorithmic equivalent. I'm not denying that &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are useful symbols, they are used often in applied mathematics, but i feel that they should be put in their own section rather than with &lt; and &gt;. I mean, ≤ and ≥ have their own section, and they are way closer in meaning to &lt; and &gt; than &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;. 

By the way, after a bit of thought, the only place where I can think &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; can be used algorithmically is if they are used to denote &quot;much less/greater than&quot; in transfinite set theory, as in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 \ll \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, but I have never seen it used that way so I highly doubt it. So dont mention it in the article because its just my idea ;). --[[User:AndreRD|AndreRD]] 11:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

::I was the one that originally added the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; entries to the table.  I put them in the same section as the other inequalities because they do in fact represent a subset of the notion of &quot;inequality&quot;, albeit an informal one.  The article will be used by casual readers as well as mathematicians, and the casual reader will not attach much significance to the distinction of &quot;algorithmic vs. non-algorithmic&quot; relationships.  A casual user who is trying to find the &quot;much greater than&quot; symbol would tend to look for it in the area of the table that deals with equality and inequality, because those concepts are much more familiar to a wider audience.  [[User:Capitalist|capitalist]] 02:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Capitalist|capitalist]] 02:39, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
::I agree that != and &lt;&gt; should not be part of the main table in this way. IMO you can't really claim that they are generalised 'computer science' terms, since their use is language dependent. 'Keyboard friendly' sounds sensible, but then they shouldn't appear in the HTML/Tex column.

== other norms ==

Sometimes the &quot;absolute value&quot; symbol is used to mean the Euclidean distance (or with a subscript it could mean any of a class of norms).  Many economics and calculus texts throw this at students without explination or the explination is in the little read appendix or chapter zero.  I recieved some questions about this today, and thought that maybe adding in a note at least about euclidean distance to the absolute value symbol section would be good.  I'm not sure about other norms, as they would usually be more advanced or well introduced near their first use.

== Split the table, maybe? ==

I've recently been studying set theory at great length, and had difficulty finding a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of [[Set-builder notation]], finding the wiki article on the subject useless. After 30 minutes wasted trawling wiki and Google for a guide, I finally found this page, and I'd love to link set-builder notation to this page, but jump to the appropriate symbols. For this reason I think the table should be split into sub-tables based on usage - one heading for symbols used everywhere, one heading for set theory, etc.
I feel it'd not only make interwiki linking easier, but also improve readability. Unfortunately, I lack the ability to do this myself - wiki table markup makes my head spin. [[User:AKismet|AKismet]] 08:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

:: I've had a go at splitting a little of the table at [[User:H2g2bob/sandbox]], just to get an idea of what it's like. This duplicates some of the symbols into different tables. But as I see it, the choice is between:

::* Keep the table as one table, but explain everything so it is really long. As more and more symbols are added, the table might become almost unreadable.
::* Remove all descriptions and have a very slimlined list, just pointing to other articles.

===Split the table--renewed proposal===
This topic seems to have died out without a conclusion. I believe the table would be better if split into a small number (perhaps 3-5) sections. These sections might be Basic notation, Set theory, Logic, etc. The list would be nicer to look at, easier to read, easier to update. Symbols used in more than one category would be repeated but only an explanation and example relevant for each section would be given there. Then there could be a note to point readers to uses of the same symbol in other sections.  Any objections to this?

You may say &quot;yes&quot; and then you admit that &quot;=&quot; is not the same as &quot;≡&quot;, &lt;br /&gt; then to write an equation accurately we need to write:&lt;br /&gt;

You may also write: x * (y/x) = y and x is not 0. (2)&lt;br /&gt;

y &lt;= x * (y/x) and x * (y/x) =&gt; y, while &quot;=&gt;&quot; means &quot;iff&quot;.

I read the discussion of != above for &quot;not equal&quot;, and it's validity as a typeable equivalent to a mathematical symbol, thanks to use in programming languages and plaintext fora.

== Meaning of - sign ==

Would it be acceptable to mention that the - sign denotes &quot;the opposite of&quot; in many high-school applications?

For example, -6 denotes the opposite of 6, which would be -6, and -(-4) denotes the opposite of -4, which would be 4.

In this context &quot;opposite&quot; is roughly equivalent to &quot;negative&quot;. The distinction is subtle, and I'm not interested in nitpicking the differences. I'd just like to see both words used to describe the symbol's meaning, for the benefit of users who may be familiar with one word or the other.

== Inability to display symbols ==

I am one of those who has been frustrated by the inability to display
the symbols on the &quot;Table of mathematical symbols&quot; page on one of
my two almost identical computers.  They both run Windows XP, SP2
but use two different versions of Microsoft Office. According to Microsoft
the font MS Mincho (file msmincho.ttc, an 8.9 Megabyte file) should be included
with XP, but it was not present in the faulty computer. I copied the file from
the &quot;good&quot; computer (to the C:\WINDOWS\Fonts directory) to the &quot;bad&quot; computer
and that fixed the problem.
I do not fully understand the problem however, because the &quot;Help:Displaying a
Mathematical Formula&quot; Wikipedia page displayed all the symbols perfectly on
both computers from day one.

That's probably related to the version of windows you have installed.  MS Mincho only
installs itself on my machines if I setup the Asian Language support in the 'Regional and Language Options.'

I usually use it with the Japanese IME.  Later versions of windows have come with it, but
it's usually only if the machine needs to process non-standard English characters.  Many English speaking users don't typically need that.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.74.226.44|74.74.226.44]] ([[User talk:74.74.226.44|talk]]) 23:23, 13 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Symbols ==

It's sort of pointless to open a page and see a square box for some of the symbols. 

I have tried &amp;amp;#8810; as Times New Roman, Tahoma, and Lucida Console - and it gives me a square on each.  Obviously it works with some font, as it works on my vista machine.

&lt;br&gt;Answer -- We should not use images in place of symbols; symbol glyphs are much more versatile in terms of typefaces (granted, unless one is using a limited font which does not include them), but symbol glyphs also superior when it comes to scaling, screen readers, and just plainly for knowing which symbol to use in your own texts (assuming you don't want gifs in your math papers). --[[User:JanGB|JanGB]] ([[User talk:JanGB|talk]]) 11:14, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

== Computer science ==

There has been brief discussion above ([[Talk:Table_of_mathematical_symbols#not_equals|not_equals]], [[Talk:Table_of_mathematical_symbols#.21|!]]) of the merit of including the versions from computer science.  Will I give away my bias if I call these &quot;corruptions&quot;?  I have seen 37o instead of 37° (degrees), and even x&lt;sub&gt;oo&lt;/sub&gt; instead of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (infinity).  Feel free to include these 'options' too ...but just not in the same field as the correct symbols.

Anyway, I think it would be better to split the leftmost column in two, using perhaps two different shades of green.&lt;br&gt;
True mathematical symbols on the extreme left, then other 'options' beside them, not equally prominent.  The columns to the right don't contain so much text, and can easily be squeezed.  (And the notes about &quot;computer science&quot; can then be cut altogether, or relegated to a clarifying footnote.)&lt;br&gt;

== Switch TeX and HTML Columns ==

Some symbols shown in the HTML font are not immediately recognisable. To facilitate quick scrolling, I put forward that we should switch the columns. This may seem like a small difference, but for people with bad peripheral vision who scroll quickly, it makes a big difference. 

Example: Try to find the product symbol, &lt;math&gt; \prod &lt;/math&gt;, quickly looking at the HTML column. It looks very much like other symbols, and not it all like it is usually represented in textbooks.

==TeX==

A lot of people have complained about not being able to see the symbols; I created a test version of this article and of the row template in which both HTML and TeX can be used: [[User:Alksentrs/Table of mathematical symbols (testing)]].

PS: I can see every HTML symbol except ∧ (U+2227: Logical And, &lt;math&gt;\and&lt;/math&gt;), which appears like this: ∘ (U+2218: Ring Operator, &lt;math&gt;{}^{^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;).

:What do you mean by ''Maybe a vector is not considered a &quot;mathematical symbol&quot;?'' A vector is an object which combines a direction and a length. A symbol is just a picture which represents something. You can ''represent'' a vector with a symbol, but that won't make the vector ''into'' a symbol.

== What is [[mathematics]] then?==
Hi Alksentrs!&lt;br&gt;
thanks for answering me!&lt;br&gt;
That's a good point you made: &lt;br&gt;
:'''You can ''represent'' a vector with a symbol, but that won't make the vector ''into'' a symbol'''.&lt;br&gt;
Well I wonder what do we universally mean for [[mathematics]] then... because in ancient ages mathematics was strictly connected with [[astrology]] and [[cosmology]] (please also see [[Astrology and astronomy]] article).&lt;br&gt;
According to the wikipedian article...:&lt;br&gt;
:''(...)The word &quot;mathematics&quot; comes from the [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), which means ''learning'', ''study'', ''science'', and additionally came to have the narrower and more technical meaning &quot;mathematical study&quot;.(...)''&lt;br&gt;
Talking about &quot;learning&quot;, &quot;studying&quot; etc. we should then take a look to who was [[Pythagoras]].&lt;br&gt;
According to the wikipedia article...:&lt;br&gt;
:'' '''Pythagoras of Samos''' (...); born between 580 and 572 BC, died between 500 and 490 BC) was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]] and founder of the religious movement called [[Pythagoreanism]]. He is often revered as a great mathematician, [[mystic]] and [[scientist]];
Pythagoras made influential contributions to [[philosophy]] and [[religion|religious]] teaching in the late 6th century BC.''&lt;br&gt;
:''(...) He was the first man to call himself a [[philosopher]], or lover of wisdom. (...)''&lt;br&gt;
:''(...) In pythagorean cosmology it was used the monad symbol. Please take a look at right picture please. (...)''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Monad.svg|thumb|The [[Monad (symbol)|Monad]] was a symbol referred by the Greek philosophers as &quot;The First,&quot; &quot;The Seed,&quot; &quot;The Essence,&quot; &quot;The Builder,&quot; and &quot;The Foundation&quot;]].&lt;br&gt;
Said that I noticed that there are astounding similarities with:&lt;br&gt;
:''The [[sun (astrology)|sun symbol]] ([[Image:Sun symbol.svg|22px]]) which is considered a very important part of [[astrology]]''.&lt;br&gt;

== What is this K? ==

Not sure how to do the font, but in the sections on R (reals), Z (integers), etc., there is a K which is described as being the union of the reals and the complex numbers. Well excuse me but the set of complex numbers (C) is the union of the reals and the complex numbers. The real line is part of the complex plane and 3 (for example) is a complex number, 3 + 0i. Put simply, ''R is a subset of C!''

I haven't heard of K before and I'm not necessarily disputing its existence but if it is a mathematical symbol then its definition/explanation is clearly wrong. Perhaps the person who wrote it in was confusing the complex numbers {a + bi | a, b real} with the imaginary numbers {ai | a real}?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.159.20.37|81.159.20.37]] ([[User talk:81.159.20.37|talk]]) 16:04, 8 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In complex analysis, the Omega constant, a solution of Lambert's W function
A variable for a 2-dimensional region in calculus, usually corresponding to the domain of a double integral.

In combinatory logic, the looping combinator, (λ x. x x) (λ x. x x)
In group theory, the omega and agemo subgroups of a p-group, Ω(G) and ℧(G)

== symbols used in early 20th century quantum mechanics ==

Looking at ''Sources of Quantum Mechanics'' by B. L van der Waerden, there are symbols that I have not seen explained/interpreted:
v with a single dot over it, p. 262
other letters with double dots over them

Somewhere we need to collect and explain these elements of discourse that may otherwise be or become unknown to readers. [[User:Patrick0Moran|P0M]] ([[User talk:Patrick0Moran|talk]]) 03:31, 30 May 2009 (UTC)
:I found it. A single &quot;dot accent&quot; indicates the derivative with respect to time, so x-dot is the first derivative and it gives the x component of velocity. A double dot accent indicates the second derivative with respect to time, so x-dot is the x component of acceleration. It looks like this convention goes back to Newton.

== Dirac notation ==

I dispute the claim that the notation of &lt;|&gt; for an inner product originates in computer science.  This is Dirac's notation, invented in the early 20th century.

I guess what I should have said is that I find this text a bit confusing:
::&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many variants of the notation, such as 〈u | v〉 and (u | v), which are described below. The less-than and greater-than symbols are primarily from computer science; they are avoided in mathematical texts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
::If the statement regarding computer science is meant to apply only to inner product notation framed by less-than/greater-than symbols (which also commonly appears in physics documents typeset in HTML) perhaps this should be more carefully distinguished from the angle bracket form.  If the two notations are considered synonymous then the phrase &quot;are primarily from computer science&quot; appears to imply one of two things; either that computer science is the primary source of this notation (i.e. that it originated in this field) or that it contains the primary usage of such notation (i.e. that it can be shown that this notation occurs with greater relative frequency in this field than in any other).  I find either implication a bit troubling without further support.

Disagree.
I disagree and think it should be removed; or if not removed at least have a note put with it.  It is not a proper symbol for multiplication.  Yes, we understand what is meant when we are in a calculator or computer context, but is is not correct mathematical grammar.  It is a bastardization introduced by calculators and then computers due to special limitations of calculator displays and input in come computer languages.  It only exist on a number pad because computer types who designed the number pads did not know any better. It is only that way in Excel because the designers of the program wanted to provide a quicker way to type in a multiplication from the keyboard than having to go find how to do a superscript over and over.  It is similar to the ^ being used for raising to a power.  3^2 is not a proper way to write 3 squared.  And 3E2 or 3EE2 are not proper mathematical grammar either.  These were all bastardizations made back when calculator displays were primitive and the pixie-tubes and seven-segment displays could not display the proper symbols. Sure when we see it we know what it is; but we should not write it.  Similar to when we hear aint, we know what the person means; but we still should not say or write it ourselves.  At least but it at the bottom of the list with a note not to use it in formal maths.  ([[User:Bob.A51|Bob.A51]] ([[User talk:Bob.A51|talk]]) 08:11, 9 May 2014 (UTC))

== Many unicode mathematical symbols not covered in this article. ==

There are three sets of mathematical symbols contained in the Unicode character set.   Presumably each of these characters had to have a justification presented to be accepted for inclusion in unicode.   It would be nice if all of these symbols, with an explanation of their use, perhaps based on the unicode submission, were included in this article.   I often need new symbols for my own use, and if an exiting symbol for that use exists I'd rather use that than invent something new; it would be nice if this article were a comprehensive list.

:[[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode]] does show all the symbols without explanation. Unicode.org does give each symbol a specific name and use,[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2200.pdf] but I've not found details of inclusion criteria. Some pages like [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode)]] do go into greater detail which might be an idea for the mathematical unicode pages, but it is quite a bit of work to do. --[[User:Salix alba|Salix]] ([[User talk:Salix alba|talk]]): 16:41, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

== Logical Mirror Symbols ==
All directed logical symbols can also be used in their mirror form. It is not
only allowed for arithmetic such as &quot;1 &lt; 2&quot; and &quot;2 &gt; 1&quot; to use mirrors. But also
for logic &quot;swan -&gt; white&quot; and &quot;white &lt;- swan&quot;. Unicode, Tex etc.. has all the symbols
for it. For a real life use of &lt;- see for example here:

http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_128.html 

More evidence is found in ISO 31-11:

:⇒ 	p ⇒ q 	implication sign 	if p then q; p implies q 	
:Can also be written as q ⇐ p. Sometimes → is used.

== ↯ for &quot;contradiction&quot; ==

The zigzag or lightning arrow, ↯, is used (also) as meaning &quot;contradiction&quot; in fairly many academic places, such as proofs on boards also slides, but also some printed/prepared material.
The main fact is already stated in [[↯]]. A book example is given in [[Proof by contradiction#Notation]].

Various internet discussions show that there is some preference for the use of ↯:
* http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/28192/is-there-a-contradiction-symbol-in-some-font-somewhere

== Incorrect / Superfluous use of := symbol?  ==

In the section about summation symbol, the example &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2&lt;/math&gt; is shown as ''equal by definition to'' &lt;math&gt;::=1+4+9+16&lt;/math&gt;. I am assuming the two colons are a typo. 
Is equal to (=) not a more correct symbol here? I saw that it has been used in other examples also where it seems superfluous to me. So I might be wrong but I could not find clarity about its use. Is this by design?

== Reorganize ==

I would like to propose reorganizing this list to make it easier for readers to find entries. At the very least I would separate letter-based symbols from the rest and alphabetize them. Preferably I would do a more elaborate taxonomy, as follows:

#Symmetric relations (=, etc.)
#Unsymmetric relations (&lt;, &gt;, etc.)
#Operators (+, etc.)
#Brackets ( [, ], etc.)
#Set theory (This is a natural grouping. I'd cross reference to here, e.g. union U, element-of E, from Latin letters, inclusion from unsymmetric relations)
#Other symbols
#Latin letter-like symbols (I would list e.g. dagger and the perp symbol under T)
#Hebrew and Greek letter-like symbols (e.g. co-product under Pi)
#Letter modifiers (a-bar, a-hat, etc.)

I'd also suggest adding a short list of basic symbols, say through high school math, at the beginning. As this is a major reorg and a lot of work, I'd like to get some consensus first. Comments?--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 15:19, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

::Yes: organization by subject makes sense, and I'd prefer this. One is usually looking for the meaning of a symbol within a subject area, and such a structure would make use of the table easier.  There will be some duplication (same symbol used in multiple areas, with or without nuances specific to the subject area). —[[User_talk:Quondum|Quondum]] 16:43, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

It might be good to have two lists, one by subject and one by symbol type. The later, which could be made from what we already have, as I suggested, would be useful if one did not know what subject to look under. Sometimes one encounters in an article on one subject an unfamiliar symbol from a different subject. (What motivated me was the symbol E in the article on the [[Traveling salesman problem]]. I guessed it might be expected value, but I had to scroll to the very end of this article to confirm that.) For a [[List of mathematical symbols by subject]] article, it would be fairly easy to translate Quartl's very nice [[:de:Liste mathematischer Symbole]] into English. The hard TeX and table stuff would not have to change at all. But I wonder if there are any MediaWiki or external tools that could make this a multilingual page?--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 18:28, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

: The proposed reorganization seems like an improvement, but I have this particular qualm: Some of the sections seem to be named after the _meaning_ of the symbols (&quot;unsymmetric relations&quot;, etc.) and others after their typographical features (Greek letters, symbols with bars) etc.  Having two different ways of classifying them --- by meanint, or by typography --- might make sense if if the whole set of symbols appears in both classifications.  But otherwise it seems rather infelicitous. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] ([[User talk:Michael Hardy|talk]]) 18:36, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

:::Having just gone through this list to find a specific symbol (∑ to correct the above mentioned problem) I am in agreement that reorganization is needed. Organization by subject makes sense if the user knows the proper name of the subject in which the symbol appears. Some symbols are not tied to a specific subject, such as ∑, so how does a user know that they can find it in just about any subject? I think that any organization is going to need to have a great deal of redundancy (or at least internal links). I support the idea of having a short list of the more common symbols followed by subject specific symbols arranged by subject. Organization within these groupings is going to be problematic no matter how it is done if the sections have any length to them. I would tend to want to use a scheme that has already appeared in the literature, so that someone else can shoulder the blame when the complaints roll in. [[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 18:49, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

I agree that if we have one list by subject, the other list should be entirely typographical. My thought with unsymmetric relations was that many symbols visually point to the right or left, e.g. &gt; and &lt; but also set inclusion, logical inference, etc. I think they make a grouping that would be easy to search through. Similarly there are a number of variations on the equals sign, that form a natural grouping, and so on. Here is a revised proposal:

#Basic math symbols
#Symmetric symbols
##Symbols based on equality &quot;=&quot;
##Symbols based on arithmetic operators (+, -, X, /) 
##Other symmetric symbols
#Asymmetric symbols
##Symbols that point left or right (&lt;, &gt;, etc.)
##Other asymmetric symbols
#Brackets ( [, ], etc.)
#Symbols based on letters
##Latin letter-like symbols (I would list e.g. dagger and the perp symbol under T)
##Hebrew and Greek letter-like symbols (e.g. co-product under Pi)
##Letter modifiers (a-bar, a-hat, etc.)
