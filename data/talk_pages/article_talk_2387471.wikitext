I have got that image &quot;Image:Padmanabhapuram_Palace.jpg&quot;  from &quot;www.swathithirunal.org&quot;.The image is not exactly like in that Website.I've altered it slightly. That's why I said ,I have created it.Thank You. - [[User:Vaikunda Raja|வைகுண்ட ராஜா]]
:The web site states that images are for non-commercial use only.  These would be given the tag: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{noncommercial}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;.  However, because Wikipedia is mirrored by commercial sites, such images are not allowed and will be deleted.  Please tag all images originally derived from www.swathithirunal.org with the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{noncommercial}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; to await deletion. Thank You. It does not matter that you modified it, the original image is still copyrighted.  --[[User:Michael180|michael180]] 21:16, August 5, 2005 (UTC)

:Sir, my source was Wikipedia! I took this map: [[:Image:Position_of_Taranaki.png]] And then I tweaked it. Not only Palmerston North, but for EVERY city in New Zealand. [[User:WikiDon|WikiDon]] 17:28, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
:Because the original is in the [[Public Domain]], that means that you are also going to release your maps in the Public Domain (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Can you also tag your other maps that you made from [[:Image:Position_of_Taranaki.png]] like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD}} based of [[:Image:Position_of_Taranaki.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
