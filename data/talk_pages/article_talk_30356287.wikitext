Hello and welcome to Wikipedia!  We appreciate encyclopedic contributions, but some of '''[[Special:Contributions/{{BASEPAGENAME}}|your recent edits]]''', such as the ones to the page [[:Federalist%20Party]], do not conform to our policies.  For more information on this, see [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|Wikipedia's policies on vandalism]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|limits on acceptable additions]]. If you'd like to experiment with the wiki's syntax, please do so in the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|&quot;sandbox&quot;]] rather than in articles.

If you still have questions, there is a [[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|new contributor's help page]], or you can write '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' below this message along with a question and someone will be along to answer it shortly.
