== Picture of Governing Body Members ==

The picture is out of date. In the past two years three of the body - Carey Barber, Albert Schroeder, and Daniel Sydlik - have finished their earthly course, as stated in the article. This would leave nine living members. Has anyone been appointed to replace these three?
