[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of [[Special:Contributions/Qwert4life|your recent edits]], such as the one you made to [[:Arvind Mehendale]], did not appear to be constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]] or removed. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;  [[User:Allens|Allens]] ([[User_talk:Allens|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Allens|contribs]]) 20:53, 12 March 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Arvind Mehendale]]. Your edits appear to constitute [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] and have been '''automatically''' [[Help:Reverting|reverted]].
* If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG makes very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|mistakes]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been considered as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|950064}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
*'''If you need help''', please see our '''[[Help:Contents|help pages]]''', and if you can't find what you are looking for there, please feel free to place &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on [[Special:MyTalk|your talk page]] and someone will drop by to help.
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Arvind Mehendale]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arvind+Mehendale&amp;diff=481575166&amp;oldid=481574184 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/Qwert4life|Qwert4life]] [[User:Qwert4life|(u)]] [[User talk:Qwert4life|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.950506 on 2012-03-12T21:00:45+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 950064 --&gt;.
