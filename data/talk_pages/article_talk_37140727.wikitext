[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:ESkog|ESkog]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/71.50.80.237|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Niccolò and Maffeo Polo]], because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:ESkog|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;([[User:ESkog|ESkog]])&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:ESkog|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 23:17, 27 September 2012 (UTC)
