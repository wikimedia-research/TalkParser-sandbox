== Old discussions ==
Can we stop redirecting eating to here? I think it makes more sense to have separate articles just like book is not redirected to reading. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]]

: sounds like a good idea. Presumably, you'd have &quot;meal&quot; about social customs and &quot;eating&quot; more about digestion and diet and so on? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 16:41, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC)

: I guess. I am going to split it off. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]]

== Courses ==

I combined comments of the same repeated topic to one area where it can be concentrated. I hope no one minds. If so I do apologize in advance I am still learning.

Some cultures also drink soup after main course. 

Also, when I eat at a restaurant, the salad is before the main course. Any other information on this? [[User:128.6.175.26|128.6.175.26]] 18:00, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;Three course meal&lt;/big&gt; 

Can we perhaps have a section on the three course meal, perhaps the origins? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziryab#Cuisine] [[User:Faro0485|Faro0485]] ([[User talk:Faro0485|talk]]) 12:05, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

=== Amount of meals a day and plate composition ===
Normally 3 meals/day (of some 600 kcal per meal) with 4-6 hours recess and no snacks in between are recommended by BCM for an average person. See [http://www.bcminfo.be/precon2/ this site/diagram]. Also, the plate of a course is recommended to be filled 1/2 with vegetables, 1/4th with protein-food (eg meat, soy, ...) and 1/4th with carbohydrate foods (eg pasta, rice, ...)  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.246.136.92|81.246.136.92]] ([[User talk:81.246.136.92|talk]]) 11:39, 3 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Removed the image this relates to, the BCM link is dead, BCM is a company selling products - not a reliable source of such information. The image was titled 'most peoples meal set up' but also included advice. Inslun level graph had no scale and therefore is meaningless.

=== British mealtimes ===

The main mealtimes in Britain (as backed up by AskOxford.com) are:

* Breakfast - The first meal of the day.[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/breakfast?view=uk]

* Lunch - A meal around midday (often light).[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/lunch?view=uk]

* Tea - A cooked evening meal.[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/tea?view=uk]

* Supper - A light or informal evening meal.[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/supper?view=uk]

* Dinner - The main meal of the day, regardless of whether it's at midday or in the evening.[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/dinner?view=uk]The main meal tends to be in the evening, so tea and dinner are often seen as synonymous.

We could either display the mealtimes in sections based on nationality, or have a list based on times specifying which name is applied in which place.--[[User:Jcvamp|Jcvamp]] ([[User talk:Jcvamp|talk]]) 14:14, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

:In regards to American mealtimes, it seems (based on Dictionary.com) as though they are identical excep that supper is any evening meal.--[[User:Jcvamp|Jcvamp]] ([[User talk:Jcvamp|talk]]) 14:31, 20 July 2008 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Doctorkc|Doctorkc]] ([[User talk:Doctorkc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Doctorkc|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

=== The Meals Tab ===

Am I the only one who thinks the &quot;Meals&quot; tab looks more like it was made by a Lord of the Rings geek than someone making a professional-looking encyclopedia? I.E. Pippin's rant in the first movie about &quot;Breakfast, Second Breakfast, Elevenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner, Supper&quot;.  Nothing against Lord of the Rings geeks since I am myself one, but I just don't think it belongs here. [[User:Burnside65|Burnside65]] 22:00, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

--[[User:Doctorkc|Doctorkc]] ([[User talk:Doctorkc|talk]]) 08:08, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

I'm removing the image on &quot;plate composition&quot;. I'm sure whoever inserted it was trying to be helpful, and their effort is appreciated, but it's really not adequate. It's entitled simply &quot;General make-up of a plate&quot;, which is far too vague. Is this supposed to be a diagram of the general proportions of food types during a meal? Of the layout of food types? Does it correspond to what is actually done (if so, in what country(-ies), anf by what percentage of populations?), or to what is recommended (where, when and by whom?)? Does it claim to be universal, or culture-specific? What are its sources? Is this what the &quot;general&quot; composition of plates / meals is like in India? In Ecuador? In Zambia? In Fiji? At present, it's more confusing than helpful. [[User:Aridd|Aridd]] ([[User talk:Aridd|talk]]) 12:26, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

=== Image re-insertion ===

I reinserted following image:
[[Image:Meal times.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Most-people's meals set-up]]

I noticed that someone found the image poor-quality to which I agree (I drew it myself, by hand). However, i still find it relevant here. As such, if you don't like the image, remake it by computer and image program and upload the new version over it, however still leave the image linked here.

Thanks;

=== Marines Image ===

Why the image of marines eating a meal? I can't help but feel that it's trying to make a statement of some sort, especially as it appears to be more focused on the marines than the meal. [[User:Muleattack|Muleattack]] ([[User talk:Muleattack|talk]]) 12:49, 23 December 2008 (UTC)  

=== Plate Make-up and Daily Meals ===

The plate make-up image isn't a fair representation of what people generally put into a meal. Meat, vegetables, and especially rice aren't present in every meal. I don't understand why, when a meal can consist of so many things, there is a picture trying to generalise.

The daily meals section doesn't specify which culture the terms are used in. The terms 'low tea' and 'high tea' are rarely used in the UK, 'tea' is usually the name given to the evening meal, and is synonymous with the US 'dinner'. It needs to be made clear which terms are used where, and which are actually main meals.--[[Special:Contributions/88.106.35.223|88.106.35.223]] ([[User talk:88.106.35.223|talk]]) 13:16, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

==No mention of Smoko?==

Why has Smoko been left out, it is a very important part of most blue collar workers days.[[User:Trumpy|Trumpy]] ([[User talk:Trumpy|talk]]) 06:53, 20 September 2008 (UTC)

:That's a New Zealand term, isn't it? Feel free to add it, with references to proper academic sources. [[User:Aridd|Aridd]] ([[User talk:Aridd|talk]]) 12:28, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

Umm, no, it has been used in the UK since the 1940's, it is also used in Australia.
Proper academic sources, eh?, you mean like those that don't know the meaning of the word? ([[User:Trumpy|Trumpy]] ([[User talk:Trumpy|talk]]) 08:33, 6 October 2008 (UTC))

:I've never heard it used in the UK, but that's probably just me. As for sources, see: [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. Read it carefully before making any edits. You're welcome to add information to this article, but if what you add isn't properly sourced, it will be challenged and may be removed. [[User:Aridd|Aridd]] ([[User talk:Aridd|talk]]) 09:18, 6 October 2008 (UTC)

== Sections ==

I'm trying to figure out how to organize the article, which should make it easier to contribute. My suggestion is something like:
#Mealtimes
##Historically
##Western culture
##Eastern culture
#Types
##Formal
###Occasions: Wedding, etc.
###Multicourse meal
##Informal
###Barbecue

I think once we have the sections, it will be easier to add content to the right place. Thoughts? -- [[User:Ypnypn|Ypnypn]] ([[User talk:Ypnypn|talk]]) 14:02, 25 December 2013 (UTC)
