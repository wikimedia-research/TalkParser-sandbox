'''''Welcome to Wikipedia'''''
----

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! 

Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]].  I hope you like it here and decide to stay.  

Someone using this IP address has made unhelpful edits{{#if:|&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:{{{1}}}]]|}}, which have been [[Help:Revert|reverted]].  If you did this, in the future please try to contribute in a more constructive manner.  If you did not do this, you may wish to consider &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup&amp;returnto=Main_Page}} getting a username]&lt;/span&gt; to avoid confusion with other editors.

You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits of having a username]].  Without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you.

If you need help see:
*[[Help:Contents|Help contents]] - the main help page.
*[[Wikipedia:Quick guide|Quick guide]] - a &quot;cheatsheet&quot; listing the main editing commands.

I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]!
