Hello, and '''''[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!'''''

Someone using this [[IP address]], {{BASEPAGENAME}}, has made unhelpful edits&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Camille Paglia]], which have been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]].  If you did this, in the future please try to contribute in a more constructive manner.  If you did not do this, you may wish to consider &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup&amp;returnto=Main_Page}} getting a username]&lt;/span&gt; to avoid confusion with other editors.

You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free, requires no personal information, and has many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits]].  Without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you.

Some good links for newcomers are:
*[[Help:Contents|Help contents]] – the main help page.
*[[Wikipedia:Quick guide|Quick guide]] – a &quot;cheatsheet&quot; listing the main editing commands.
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]

Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] on talk pages using four (~&amp;#126;~~); this will automatically produce your name and timestamp. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:Cargoking{{!}}my talk page]], or place &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;helpme}}&lt;/code&gt; on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions.

Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:Welcome-anon-vandal --&gt; —&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid #000;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Cargoking|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#000080;&quot;&gt;'''Cargoking'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Cargoking|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#f9f9f9;background:#000000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 01:04, 26 June 2012 (UTC)
