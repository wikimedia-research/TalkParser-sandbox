If a work's original author leaves a well-reasoned treatise delineating all the specific arguments why, in this unique instance, a verb within the title of a work, in the English-speaking world, should have the initial letter in the lowercase form, then we would at least have something substantial to discuss.

:::History and literature are replete with stylistic peculiarities and the further back we go, the more common such individualistic stylizations become. Orthography was not the primary thought in the minds of some (many?) creative geniuses. Punctuation and capitalization in the handwritings of [[James Joyce]] have been the subject of considerable discussion. If there is a deeply felt, specified reason (religious, philosophical) for deviating from standard orthography, we would at least have a topic for intellectual exchange, such as the uppercase/lowercase name discussions on the talk pages of [[E. E. Cummings]], not [[ee cummings]], or [[bell hooks]], not [[Bell Hooks]]. All we have here is an assumption &quot;with his consent or even following his wish&quot;, in other words, if he had an objection, he would have said something. Such reverse-negative [[justification by faith]], and not even in its theological meaning, obscures the simple possibility that originally the lowercase &quot;w&quot; may have been a self-perpetuating misprint with which no one bothered to raise an issue.[[User:Roman Spinner| &amp;mdash;Roman Spinner]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Roman Spinner|(talk)(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:22, 7 December 2013 (UTC)
::::Let's assume for a moment the lowercase &quot;w&quot; was what you call a misprint: it would still be the version that piece came to be known.

:::::At the end of the day as well as a few decades, all we have is silence on the matter. Silence from the composer, from the publishers, from any proofreaders who might have taken part in any possible discussions, and no input from anyone else who might throw any additional light on the subject. The composer, apparently, did not consider this &quot;peculiarity&quot; important enough to devote time for a note to be attached to this work, thus offering some explanation for the verb within the title rendered with a lowercase &quot;w&quot;, but ultimately, what possible explanation could there be? Taking into account that [[English Wikipedia]] is a key information source for the English-speaking world and beyond, and we, its editors who are present here, do consider the matter important enough to devote the time we are now spending on it, we can set the standard for future uses of this title by indicating its main header in proper orthographic form with, perhaps, a mention in the lead paragraph that the word &quot;Was&quot; in the title had frequently or traditionally appeared in catalogs and other references with a lowercase &quot;w&quot;.[[User:Roman Spinner| &amp;mdash;Roman Spinner]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Roman Spinner|(talk)(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:53, 8 December 2013 (UTC)

:::::::Those who devote their time on Wikipedia to correcting orthographic errors, without necessarily being professional proofreaders, know how frequently corrective moves have to be made when editors create articles in which they render proper names (within main title header) using lowercase letters or, almost as frequently, use uppercase letters for common words. For whatever reason, the verbs &quot;Is&quot; and &quot;Was&quot;, when used as part of the name of a work of art, are particularly susceptible, with some editors laboring under the miscomprehension that these require lowercase usage akin to conjunctions and prepositions. Earlier this year, for example, an editor specifically requested that the title of the 1969–71 television series, ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]'', which appears on-screen in all-caps, should be moved to ''[[This is Tom Jones]]'' and the request was approved without a discussion. [[Benjamin Britten]] was a genius who, for all we know, may have had little interest in, or patience for, orthography, but for those of us who consider proper capitalization and adherence to the agreed-upon elements of the Manual of Style, a matter of principle, time is never squandered when it is devoted to a worthy goal. Foolish consistency may be known as the hobgoblin of little minds, but intelligent consistency is the way to grow and maintain an encyclopedia.[[User:Roman Spinner| &amp;mdash;Roman Spinner]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Roman Spinner|(talk)(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:47, 8 December 2013 (UTC)

== &quot;A Boy was Born&quot; vs &quot;A Boy Was Born&quot; in the text ==

So now we have had a consensus move of the title to &quot;A Boy Was Born&quot; but the article uses a mixture of &quot;was&quot; and &quot;Was&quot;.  In the lead, &quot;A Boy was Born&quot; has been placed in bold text on the basis that it is a redirect to this page and the title on first performance. Instead of various people (including me) editing capital letters in or out, let's discuss whether the reasons for having the title at &quot;Was&quot; apply to using &quot;Was&quot; in the text (and in the navbox of BB's works, which uses &quot;Was&quot; but uses a piped link to display &quot;was&quot;).  

The starting point surely is that the consensus above was to use &quot;Was&quot; in the title, and it would be disruptive to work against that.  I would have thought that the reasons behind having &quot;Was&quot; in the title of the page apply with equal reason when the title of the piece is being used in the text, for consistency.  I think that adding a variant capitalisation in bold because it's a redirect is a waste of bold ink anyway - and if &quot;Was&quot; is used throughout then the problem disappears. Thoughts?

:My thoughts (repeating): ''A Boy was Born'' is the name which was published, appears in the list of the Britten-Pears Foundation, was performed in 2013 at the Proms, broadcast by the BBC, mentioned in the publisher's commentary and other serious sources. That made me use it, with respect to history and the sources. Now I am told that house style requests a different name. Every sentence using the different name is wrong when you open the sources which I used. I find that unacceptable but am told that consensus rules here, not the Common name and the sources. - Please compare to [[Nocturnal after John Dowland]], where the name was kept. It's not even consistent between two works by Britten. - Easy solution: Move back and use &quot;was&quot; throughout. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 08:29, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

::You can repeat your arguments about the title of the article if you want but this is not an invitation or opportunity to re-open the move discussion. This is a discussion about the implementation of the title (with &quot;Was&quot;) in the body of the article - is it to be done or are both &quot;Was&quot; and &quot;was&quot; acceptable in the text? I just don't want to get involved in attempting to improve an article any further if there is going to be a continuing low-level skirmish about whether it should be &quot;was&quot; or &quot;Was&quot; in the text, hence me bringing it to the talk page.  Just because a source uses &quot;was&quot; does not mean that the article has to use &quot;was&quot; in a sentence or paragraph using that source, surely? You and I know that there are serious sources that use &quot;Was&quot; e.g. Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Britten, so what happens if I write a paragraph drawing from sources using both &quot;Was&quot; and &quot;was&quot; - do I have to use both forms, or pick one, and if so which?  As to your reference to the Britten-Pears Foundation, which I think is a reference to the Britten Thematic Catalogue [http://www.brittenproject.org/works/BTC753] - that calls it &quot;A BOY WAS BORN&quot; so that's not an argument in favour of &quot;was&quot;, is it?

::::::{{ec}}This whole debate rather reminds me of the White Knight's explanation of [[Haddocks' Eyes#Naming|the difference between the name of the song and what the song is called]]. I think ''A Boy was Born'' was almost certainly Britten's preferred title, as this is how it is presented in the score (when not presented in full caps), and aesthetically it gives emphasis to the alliterative 'B' words (certainly that makes sense to me, and it is how I most often see the title). However (perhaps unfortunately) house style on Wikipedia is not concerned with such aesthetics but with consistency, and - as has been pointed out - a number of publications on Britten by Faber (including ''Journeying Boy: The Diaries of the Young Benjamin Britten'') use capital 'W' for this title. Though I personally would prefer to see the title as Britten had it published, I don't think it's worth the aggravation of pushing the issue, so I'm happy to go along with Wiki's MOS on this and concentrate on relatively more important matters.

== Should the lead sentence include the phrase &quot;(correctly titled '''''A Boy was Born''''')&quot;? ==
{{archive top|1=Well, this was fun. I'm glad no one saw fit to edit-war over the matter. I'm joking. I think there is consensus that the &quot;correctly titled&quot; bit is a bit overblown, and {{U|BarrelProof}}'s point, that there are no reliable sources that argue the correctness of the one and the incorrectness of the other, is well taken. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Boy_Was_Born&amp;oldid=587521002 current version] has the apparent compromise, if such is possible, of &quot;published as&quot;, and given that the discussion is pretty much evenly divided I am going to close this RfC as &quot;maintain current status&quot;. &quot;Published as&quot; has the value of being true, of course, though it's precisely the value of that value that is at stake here.&lt;p&gt;Both sides have some arguments, but basically it boils down to this: the wassers say &quot;it was published this way&quot; and the Wassers say &quot;such little matters of capitalization don't really count for anything&quot;. In the particular phrase, where the capital at stake is for a word that itself carries no meaning except for indicating pastness, one can hardly argue that a capital is in itself meaningful. Many style guides, including the god-given (God-Given) MLA, suggest quietly adapting capitalization according to a particular format, in this case the one followed above for the title. I have a personal opinion too, and that's that the &quot;published as&quot; is redundant and that cutting it is in line with the &quot;liberal&quot; reading of UNDUE--but this has gone on long enough, and it's time to cut this Gordian knot. So while Bencherlite makes a very, very valid point, one supported by common sense, there is no consensus to enforce this, and I close this, essentially as &quot;no consensus for anything&quot;.  [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 04:10, 25 January 2014 (UTC)}}
(1) The consensus is that the title of the article should be &quot;A Boy Was Born&quot;.  (2) The consensus is that the article should use &quot;Was&quot; in the text.  So why on earth should we say that the &quot;correct title&quot; is &quot;A Boy was Born&quot;?  Why on earth do we have to go through all this again?

Rob, I wasn't leaning toward removing it. I just want this dispute to end, regardless of outcome. Alas, to end it, we must include &quot;A Boy was Born&quot; just once, so the rest shall say numerous times, &quot;A Boy Was Born&quot;.

:We need to try to keep this discussion constructive.

As far as I know, the only interest in including the alternative capitalization is from a couple of Wikipedia editors – there seems to be no comments about capitalization of the title in ''any'' reliable sources. As best I am aware, Wikipedia routinely adjusts the capitalization of titles per [[MOS:CT]] without comment, and I don't really see any evidence that this article should be an exception to that. Is there anything more to it than that? Is there evidence that the capitalization deserves special attention in this particular article? —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 17:14, 24 December 2013 (UTC)
::I see several editors pressing for something at the top, several willing to accept it, and only a couple (you and Sinden) fiercely resisting ANYTHING AT ALL.

:::That doesn't exactly match my count. In this discussion section, I see three opposed to mentioning the alternative capitalization (Bencherlite, Robsinden, and myself) and three in favor (Pigsonthewing, Johnbod, and ColonelHenry) – and one who seems on the fence but somewhat in favor of it (George Ho). I think Bencherlite should be counted as opposed. (Bencherlite actually removed the mention, so I think it's fair to say Bencherlite is opposed to it.) I think the question is mostly a matter of whether just changing the capitalization of one letter should reasonably be considered a variant, in view of the routine application of house styles to title capitalization (and the fact that no reliable sources seem to discuss the capitalization as being significant and probably none of them point out that two capitalization variations exist). That's a bit less support than your characterization, but it's a bit more than I thought (or expected) to find. Anyhow, at this point I think I'm willing to admit that (with some of the recent wordings that don't say the [[MOS:CT]] version is incorrect) I think it's a pretty minor issue and I don't plan on continuing to argue about it. —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 16:27, 25 December 2013 (UTC)

I'm tired of the &quot;was&quot; vs. &quot;Was&quot; on this article. &lt;s&gt;Everybody wanted &quot;Was&quot;, but someone here is trying to act like an owner of this article just because s/he created the article.

Actually, [[MOS:CAPS]] never encourages to use &quot;was&quot; in case of titles. However, the work published the word as &quot;was&quot;. Nevertheless, the consensus favors &quot;Was&quot;, and we must abide to the consensus. We did do the compromise by adding &quot;(published as '''''A Boy was Born''''')&quot; beside &quot;'''''A Boy Was Born'''''&quot;, yet I see a revert on one of my edits recently. Perhaps someone here, who may have also created this article, should reconsider [[WP:OWN|ownership on this article]] before it would be taken to [[WP:DRN]] or [[WP:3O]]. --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 08:20, 13 September 2014 (UTC)
:Though I personally prefer lower case &quot;was&quot;, I feel bound to point out that we've gone with &quot;Was&quot; not just as a matter of consensus, but as per [[MOS:CT]]: n.b. &quot;The following words should be capitalized: [...] Every verb, including forms of to be (Be, Am, Is, Are, Was, Were, Been)&quot;.

In fact, I suggest that the &quot;(published as '''''A Boy was Born''''')&quot; remark that is presently in the article already gives [[WP:UNDUE]] weight to this trivial matter and is only there because of the forcefulness of the personal subjective opinion of a minority of the involved editors.

:::::::::[[MOS:QUOTE]] is hardly pertinent, since the issue here is a title rather than a quote, and in any case none of the examples given in &quot;Typographic conformity&quot; in that section is concerned with whether the verb &quot;was&quot; should or should not have an initial capital (which is in any case is simply a matter of house style, not really about formatting). What ''is'' pertinent is [[MOS:CT]], as I've noted earlier: and there is no suggestion there that all changes to capitalisation etc. should be done &quot;without comment&quot;. In the instance of &quot;A Boy was Born/A Boy Was Born&quot;, I think it is fair to point out such a change since the original published title is not a quotation but presumably a carefully considered or at least checked presentation for publication.

We have uncounted thousands of articles in which the house style has been applied to some composition title in a way that differs from the author's original typography. In the absence of any reliable source saying that the capitalization is especially important for this particular work, it is not clear that this article needs a special note when we generally don't put such notes in other articles. —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 22:51, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::No, I am not saying &quot;we should add special notes when we apply the house style to a composition title&quot;; but I believe the option is there to explain that such a change has been made, particularly if pertinent to understanding either the work or its title. In the case of &quot;A Boy was Born&quot;, I seem to remember - for instance - reading the suggestion that Britten intended the two Bs of the title to stand out, which would of course have a resonance given the work's dedication to his father. Of course I would need to find that in a reliable source before placing it into the article. But in any case, a distinction should be borne in mind between a spoken quotation (and how it is represented in text), and a published title.

::::::::::::Thank you for the clarification. I agree; if we had some reliable source that commented on the capitalization, I would be supportive of including a comment about that in the article. The problem is that we currently have no such source, yet we currently do have, for little obvious reason other than to push this notion of special meaning, all of the following: 1) this phrase &quot;(published as '''''A Boy was Born''''')&quot;, 2) a close-up photo of the author's inscription with the other capitalization (e.g., rather than just a remark that the work was dedicated to his father), and 3) a repeat of the inscription in the caption of that figure, using the capitalization &quot;A Boy was Born&quot;. I plan to remove the quote from the caption, since it just repeats what is readable in the photo (with different typography/styling, such as using dashes instead of line breaks). —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 16:08, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

== Image ==

I have problems to understand the discussion above, sorry. Let's keep it simple. I will not change the article but suggest the following changes:

* The image from the published work is the lead image, while the current one - chosen for a Christmas DYK, but not specific to the article - goes to where Britten's historic text sources are mentioned.
* The caption doesn't repeat what people can (hopefully) read anyway, but something like: The composer dedicated his first major vocal work to his father. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 06:25, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
**If this is a discussion of the page heading image, I see no real reason for the page heading image to be included in the article. The lead already has &quot;He dedicated it to his father&quot; and the infobox has &quot;'''Dedication''': &quot;To my Father&quot;. Saying it twice seems like enough to establish that the work was dedicated to his father without also including a picture of a page heading that says that a third time. —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 19:06, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

* The question of &quot;Was&quot; versus &quot;was&quot; for the title of this work, in one form or another, has been under more-or-less continuous discussion for a year, so it's probably pretty easy to predict much of what will be said here, and by whom. As for Gerda's comment, I see no indication that the composer ever gave this question any real thought or whether he would consider the use of &quot;Was&quot; to be disrespectful. In fact, he died before Wikpedia's Manual of Style existed, and I am not aware of any commentary he ever produced about capitalization conventions for composition titles in encyclopedias. If he were here, he might in fact recommend (along with me) that formatting and other purely typographical elements of composition titles should just be adapted to English Wikipedia's conventions without comment.

== A Boy was Born (Was) ==

The argument and the question of capitalization of the 'W' to me would be of personal preference.  Often when titling a piece of work I question as to capitalize those typical words.  Leaving the, 'W', small caps however, does leave the title looking weak, but at the same time it does work.  Although when stating that in relation to the word, 'Born', small caps is fitting.  I do not understand why you have had to discuss the issue for so long, you may as well have flipped a coin.
