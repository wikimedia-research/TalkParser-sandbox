== Welcome ==
[[Image:WikipediaUncleSam.JPG|right|200px]]Hello! I've noticed that you have edited Wikipedia without logging in to an account. It's great that you've been [[Special:Contributions/{{BASEPAGENAME}}|contributing]]{{#if:|, such as the one you made in [[{{{art}}}]]|}}; however, I urge you to create an account. Here is a list of the benefits of having an account:

*You can [[Help:Starting a new page|create new pages]]
*You can use [[Help:Watching pages|watchlists]]
*You can [[Wikipedia:Uploading images|upload images]]
*You can keep your account from being unfairly [[Wikipedia:Blocking_policy|blocked]] if you share an [[IP address]]
*You can use [[Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts|scripts]] to better fight annoying [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]
*After four days, you can edit [[Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy|semi-protected pages]]

There are '''no''' cons to signing up for an account. In fact, you can find even more pros at the [[Wikipedia:Why create an account|&quot;why create an account&quot;]] page! Signing up is completely free and you don't need to enter any personal information! Plus you can have a user page, which you can use to show your interests, style, or [[WP:USER#What may I not have on my user page?|nearly]] whatever! So, unless you can think of a con, please [[Special:Userlogin|sign up]] for an account right now!
