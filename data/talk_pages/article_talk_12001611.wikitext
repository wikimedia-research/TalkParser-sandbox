==Merge into character list==
As much as I like Ace, he is totally not notable enough to warrant his own page - or have the pics of both action figure variations, for that matter. He had only cameos in the cartoon and was a minor character in Archie's comics. [[User:The S|The S]] 04:45, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

**While I enjoyed seeing photos of both Ace Duck figures and his animated appearance, Ace is '''not''' notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Even if he did, the article probably wouldn't merit all those images. If a site exists that features them, it would be perfectly suitable to link to that and create a more condensed version of this article in the TMNT character list page. This page is simply unnecessary. [[User:Caleson|Cale]] ([[User talk:Caleson|talk]]) 04:52, 1 February 2008 (UTC)
