Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that a copy be emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nonsense-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:OsamaK|O]][[User talk:OsamaK|sama]][[Special:Contributions/OsamaK|K]]&lt;sup&gt;Reply? on my [[User talk:OsamaK|talk page]], please&lt;/sup&gt; 18:48, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
