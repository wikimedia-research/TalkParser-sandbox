A tag has been placed on [[:Omar musse]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Omar musse|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Dennisthe2|'''&lt;span style=&quot;background:Orange;color:Black&quot;&gt;Dennis The Tiger&lt;/span&gt;''']]  ([[User talk:Dennisthe2|Rawr]] and [[Special:Contributions/Dennisthe2|stuff]]) 07:23, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
