[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:FenixFeather|FenixFeather]]. Wikipedia is written by people who have a wide diversity of opinions, but we try hard to make sure articles have a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. Your recent edit to [[:Click (2006 film)]] seemed less than neutral to me, so I removed it for now. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:FenixFeather|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-npov1 --&gt; &amp;ndash; [[User:FenixFeather|&lt;font color=&quot;SlateBlue&quot;&gt;'''''FenixFeather'''''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:FenixFeather|&lt;font color=&quot;SlateBlue&quot;&gt;(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/FenixFeather|&lt;font color=&quot;SlateBlue&quot;&gt;(Contribs)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:31, 15 July 2014 (UTC)
