[[:File:WW II.jpg]] is now available on [[Wikimedia Commons]] as [[:Commons:File:Andrews County Veterans Memorial.jpg]]. This is a repository of free media that can be used on all Wikimedia wikis. The image will be deleted from Wikipedia, but this doesn't mean it can't be used anymore.

Note that this is an automated message to inform you about the move. This bot did not copy the image itself. --[[User:Erwin85Bot|Erwin85Bot]] ([[User talk:Erwin85Bot|talk]]) 15:04, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
