== Colleges ==

Is Halifax really a college? I know people live there (isn't it mainly intended for families or something?), but I thought it was a sort of extension of one of the other colleges (Vanbrugh, I think). Also, is Central Hall really a &quot;popular classical venue&quot;? While I was there, I only remember the Gilbert and Sullivan Society giving concerts there - all the &quot;proper&quot; classical concerts happened in the Jack Lyons Concert Hall. --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

:Actually, now I come to think about it, they did have classical concerts in Central Hall sometimes - the university orchestra played there sometimes. I've fiddled with that part of it, but I'm still not sure about designating Halifax a college. --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

::It's used for quite a few concerts at the moment, plus G&amp;S and also the newer Central Hall Musical Society. As for families, you are thinking of the accommodation on West Moor Lane, which is near to but separate to Halifax. Quite a bit, in fact, is privately owned. -[[User:Matthew Platts|Matthew Platts]] 07:21, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

When I was an undergrad at York (1974-77) all the classical concerts were held at the Lyons Concert Hall (no Sir Jack in the name then). The classical guitarist John Williams did play in Central Hall, but he was big box office in those days. Incidentally I was an undergrad member of Wentworth.

:::CH definitely has been used as a classical music venue, as I've played in many concerts there in the past. I couldn't vouch for the quality, however ;)--[[User:Dazzla|Dazzla]] 22:38, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Although Central Hall Musical Society (CHMS) is newer than G&amp;S, it's worth pointing out that CHMS was spun out of DramaSoc in 2000, a week or so before their production of ''Assassins'', for various insurance reasons. DramaSoc (and G&amp;S) had been doing annual productions in Central Hall for quite some time before this - though I'm not old enough to know which was first! The first production entirely under the CHMS name was ''Sweet Charity'' in 2001, although CHMS retained very close links with DramaSoc for this show. Anybody know if the two societies are still as closely linked today? [[User:AndrewBooker|AndrewBooker]] 19:00, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::You're right, Halifax isn't a college. It's a residential encampment in its own private universe. Unless its been upgraded. But given it's off campus, I doubt it can be called a college. -[[User:Nommonomanac|Nommo]]

:::Halifax became a 'proper' college in the academic year 2001/02, and I have a hunch that it may have overtaken Alcuin in size to become the largest college at the university.  As far as I know there are no departments that call Halifax 'home', though this doesn't stop it from being a college in its own right. -[[User:majabl|a graduand at York]]

::::Fair enough, I've added it back. Thanks for clarifying. --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

:::::No problem.  I don't know whether it's worth updating for this, but Wentworth is a college for postgraduates now.  I'm not sure whether it became so this academic year or last academic year, though; the years often blur into one, especially for things I have nought to do with.  (For instance, Wentworth College or postgraduate study! :-)) -[[user:majabl|Matthew]]

:Halifax really is a college and by far the largest, and has been for a while I though. Especially since UPP was introduced -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]]

::Agreed. It was made a college in 2001, the first chair was James Byron. (Followed by Tim Fassam, Verity Radley, Noel Davies and James Flinders). The JCR is JJs.

Is Langwith really named after a field??? -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 01:47, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Not exactly. It's named after a field and an abandoned village, at least according to the folklore page on YSF [http://yorkstudentsfirst.iainlindley.com YSF]. [[User:Matthew Platts|Matthew Platts]] 07:21, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Yeah - if you look at the official langwith college page I seem to remember it says its named after Langwith Common [http://www.york.ac.uk/univ/coll/lang]. I just thought it was funny how the article was worded :) -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 11:25, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== College loyalties ==

I'd like to dispute that &quot;college loyalties are not especially strong&quot;. --[[User:Mooquackwooftweetmeow|Greg K Nicholson]] (Derwent)

:Compared to soemthing like oxford, cambridge or even the US sorority system its not. Teaching is done in college in oxbridge so you'd only meet people from it. In york colleges are only for accomodation and some social. I'm in Halifax but live with soemone from Goodricke and another from Derwent. -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 01:36, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Agreed (but then I would, since I wrote the disputed sentence in the first place:-).Even socially, in other collegiate Universities you probably wouldn't drink in a bar in another college, and certainly wouldn't attend social events there unless as the guest of a member. My experience at York (admittedly a few years back now, so correct me if things have changed) is that college loyaties don't extend beyond a few slogans at sports events, and a slight preference for the closest bar to one's room! [[User:Cambyses|Cambyses]] 10:44, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Sounds about right. To be fair it is more loyal than the hall's system I've seen in other unis (I'm thinking about Birmingham in this case). There are some people who probably wouldn't leave their own college unless they need a new bottle of vodka though.... -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 16:28, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::During the mid-to-late '80s, before all day opening, college loyalty was so loose that we used to head to whichever college bar opened earliest!  Langwith used to open at 18:30, but Derwent at 18:00, so we generally ended up in Derwent, at least for the start of the night.  The quality of the beer in the bars was also a factor, as of course was the quality of the 'bops' :) [[User:192.11.224.124|192.11.224.124]] 14:22, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

''Teaching is done in college in oxbridge so you'd only meet people from it'' - actually thats not true, at Cambridge many courses, including all of the sciences are taught in mixed college groups for large parts of the course. Only tutorials are taught only though the college [[User:Mammal4|Mammal4]] 12:52, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

== Central Hall pop performances ==

I notice that references to 'infamous' Boom Town Rats incident have been removed.  Is it possible that someone has access to hard evidence about the event and we can get the matter settled once and for all.  Several rumours persist throughout the University undergraduate population.  Someone with a memory going back that far would be useful, as would any campus paper archive material.  Was there actually a ban put in place by the SU or other relevant body to stop future pop bands playing?  If so, is it still in existence and what are its specifics?  --[[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 02:07, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)
I hurd ,from an old student, that the reason the university  had to stop concerts in the central hall, was that the artist performances actually damaged(minor damage)the foundation of the construction and so they has to stop any event performance of that magnitude.
The central hall is now mainly used as an examination hall and theatrical performance hall,none of which have any impact on the structure the way a concert hall filled with a huge audiance jumping up&amp; down would.--[[User:SS Peru|SS Peru]] ([[User talk:SS Peru|talk]]) 10:24, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

:Take a look at the folk lore website on this[http://yorkstudentsfirst.iainlindley.com/folklore/b-rats.html]. It is pretty detailed and AFAIK pretty accurate. I messaged the editor about it and I think he said he removed it as it implied that rumours were true (namely, central hall sunk). It's actually infamous cuz they smashed the place up a little. -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 22:52, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: Sorry another one of my late night editing sessions, i should have found that link :)  Anyways I think this is worthy of inclusion if we can trust the folklore site's conclusion as it's definitely one of the bigger University rumours, be good to clear it up '''officially''' --[[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 00:47, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::how about this: ''Performances by big-name acts have been rarer at the university following a [[1985]] [[Boomtown Rats]] concert, during which the cover of the Central Hall [[orchestra pit]] was damaged. A ban on pop performances in Central Hall was imposed by the University, although it has occasionally been waived, and Central Hall is still sometimes used for classical concerts''
:sounds good to me -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 12:36, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Departments and History Departemnt ==

Is it really necessary for the history department to have it's own section in the article? From personal experience while at the univeristy, while the hsitory department may be fairly large, it isn't that much more improtant in the greater scheme of things than many others. As alot is written about it in the article maybe a separate article would be best for hsitory and related departments. 

Whilst we are at it I think an improvement would be to include a bit more on the diffenret departments at York in the main article. A small sentence about each would be good, where they are located and when founded etc. At the least I think a simple list would be good. If more details are wanted then maybe a separate article could be created like with my suggestions for History. I think this as the departmetns are what make the university what it is and the staff in the departments are what has created the universities great reputation for teaching and research, but at the moment very little is included about many. [[User:Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] 15:40, 29th July (UTC)
: I agree with you. It is quite unbalanced, (and the History section reads a little too much a prospectus, too -- a little [[NPOV]] wouldn't hurt). [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt &lt;small&gt;Crypto&lt;/small&gt;]] 16:54, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

Anyone got a source for this?
:''The University has gained fame for being perhaps the first British University to have fraternities linked to American orders and fraternity/sorority houses.''
Thanks! [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt &lt;small&gt;Crypto&lt;/small&gt;]] 08:44, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:haha - Goodricke is now called Gamma Delta Rho? -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 09:21, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:I was surprised at this remark also. I graduated in 2001 and keep a reasonable awareness of what happens on campus. I suggest removing this line if no justification can be made of it.

:I only graduated this summer (and am still at the uni now) and I've never heard of this before. I'd almost bet money that it is probably just a small group of people who've moved into a house and decided they want to set something like this up...probably nothing much will/has come of it. They might have just put it here to make themselves feel more important...

:...then again it all be completely made up and not even have any fine thread of truth in it. 

:Either way, I suggest the line be removed too as it is not something well known at uni even if it were true. [[User:Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] 21:13, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

:: This &quot;fact&quot; is false.  No fraternities at York.

== Academic departments ==

The article's first paragraph states there are 30 academic departments, yet we only have about 27 in the list further down the page. Does anyone know what has happened to the missing three academic departments? [[User:Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] 22:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)


== Interesting fact? ==

I've removed the following from the article:

:Interesting(!) historical fact:the lectures all start at 15 minutes past the hour because, when the university first opened, the first bus from the city that arrived in heslington did so at 9:10 so the lectures began at 15 past.

I thought it might be worthwhile including it in there somehow if it could be proven to be true, but until then, I don't think it has any place in the article. [[User:Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] 23:45, 26 December 2005 (UTC)


'''Facebook''' 13,174&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; York Uni users - I think it would be &quot;fun&quot; but also interesting to state the current user count of facebook users on the York Uni network. Perhaps it is possible to distinguish between the &quot;alumni&quot; users and the &quot;current&quot; ones on facebook. I think this would show how important facebook is to York students in particular. For someone new and possibly going to York, would show straight away that facebook would be an indispensable part of uni life not to miss out on. Any suggestions?

== Media &quot;Censorship&quot; ==

I'm not familiar with YUSU or its media outlets, but the section on accusations of censorship look quite [[WP:NPOV|POV]] to me. Whilst I'm not familiar with the specific situation, I know that since the media are part of the Students' Union, in many cases this would make the Students' Union legally responsible for their output. It may be that the Students' Union asked to see articles to prevent potential libel difficulties. [[User:Jamse|Jamse]] 18:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

: I believe there may be more to it than that.  While I got most of my info from the affected newspapers (who obviously have an agenda), the timing of its inception and cases to which it has been applied (admittedly again as reported by said papers) don't entirely support the SU's welfare argument.  There's a review by Nouse [http://www.nouse.co.uk/2007/06/19/the-unwanted-gift-of-the-gag/ here]. [[User:Meloncholy|Meloncholy]] 02:16, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

== Zones? ==

Is the section on zones really necessary? I've been at the university for 3.5 years now and I've never heard anyone talk about different 'zones' on campus. Apart from that, IMHO it makes the article quite a dull read and doesn't seem like particularly useful information. [[User:Ner102|…Ner102]] 13:50, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
: Agreed. [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt &lt;small&gt;Crypto&lt;/small&gt;]] 08:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
Agreed - sounds daft.[[User:Hippo43|Hippo43]] 16:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)


-As a point, should anyone read this: Zones are used by Estates, admin and various other support services, namely Security. It's rarely ever encountered by students unless they're running an event and have to contact the Zone Manager (for example, Central Hall is part of Zone 3, I think). If you go &quot;behind the scenes&quot; as it were, there are lots of maps on the wall that clearly define these zones. Students and visitors will be unaware of these and will probably just refer to colleges when talking about location, making their use only of interest to those working on the internal running of the University. 9 March 2008.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.26.18.30|82.26.18.30]] ([[User talk:82.26.18.30|talk]]) 21:23, 9 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Spin off companies ==

I reverted the addition of a spin off company because including just the one looks suspiciously like advertising.  There are dozens of these and the page could fill up with them.  If we were to list spin off companies we should be careful just to list the most notable (though how to tell that might be fraught).  My feeling is not to list spin off companies unless they are really major international players.  What do others think?  --[[User:Rgclegg|Richard Clegg]] 12:35, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:I've been told elsewhere that lists on wikipedia are all good, so maybe a list as a separate article and just put the important ones in the main york uni article could be a plan.  If we can list enough of them that is.[[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 16:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Not sure that all lists are good but if there were several then a page for &quot;Spin off companies from the University of York&quot; would be a better place for them than the main article.  It should be noted that Cambridge has a zillion spin off companies (yes, yes, cite needed but I bet it's more than York) but doesn't link any from its wikipedia article.  --[[User:Rgclegg|Richard Clegg]] 16:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
::: I'd hope we could keep them out for now, as well. I'm also not convinced that all lists are good, but sometimes a subarticle makes a good spam trap. Even if you think it's worthless as a list, it's very easy to ignore it (unlike it cluttering a &quot;proper&quot; article). [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt &lt;small&gt;Crypto&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

== King's Manor ==

I was just wondering why there is no reference to the King's Manor, which is the second campus of The University of York.  Since it contains a number of departments (Centre for Medieval Studies, Centre for Rennaisance and Early Modern Studies, Eighteenth Century Studies and Archaeology) I thought it should probably be included in the article.  However, I may have missed a reference...?

== College system ==

''The university is nominally based on eight colleges, which provide accommodation for students and for some of the academic departments. In practice, the colleges are more like halls of residence than the traditional Oxbridge colleges.'' 

I think that this sentence is a little misleading - Sure the colleges aren't as strong as they are at Oxbridge, but they are still somewhat more than halls of residence that I have seen at other universities.  I speak with first hand experience from York and Cambridge. Maybe this should be reworded to distinguish this difference? [[User:Mammal4|Mammal4]] 11:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
:Maybe change it to 

:''The university is nominally based on eight colleges, which provide accommodation for students and for some of the academic departments. In practice, the colleges are half way between a hall of residence and a traditional Oxbridge college.''

:[[User:Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] 14:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

::Yes I think something like that would be much better - anyone else have other comments?  otherwise I'll change it.  :) [[User:Mammal4|Mammal4]] 14:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

:::I'd go for 'somewhere' rather than the precise 'half way', but otherwise I too agree.  Perhaps some explanation of why they're more than halls of residence would be useful - having never been to Oxbridge, I am not sure how their colleges operate.

== Motto ==

The motto stated, ''In limine sapientiae'', doesn't seem to have any relevant results in [http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22In+limine+sapientiae%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta= a Google search], other than Wikipedia, and the motto of some guy called John.  Could anyone translate?  I don't have a clue with Latin - at a guess, I would say something like 'toward the threshold of wisdom.'  Could anyone cite the motto?  I'm not really being accusatory, I'm just curious.  And I want to know before I arrive in October. [[User:Jameshfisher|Jameshfisher]] 16:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
:''In limine sapienti&amp;aelig;'' translates as 'at the threshold of wisdom', or alternatively 'at the doorway to knowledge'.  It's the motto on the university's coat of arms, which (despite the efforts of some overpriced bunch of charlatan design consultants and corporate image merchants) can still be found on certain formal university documents (such as degree certificates - I can probably scan mine if you're bothered).  (That's the university's real coat of arms, by the way, not to be confused with the ones that some of the colleges have adopted, which were just made up and aren't real.) -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] 20:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== DPhil ==

Is it worth mentioning that a research degrees at York is a DPhil (rather than a PhD)? I think it's the only UK University other than Oxford to use this name, but I'm not certain.  Also, if anyone knows *why* it's a DPhil and not a PhD at York I'd be interested!
:It's a PhD now, alas — the decision was taken to conform about four or five years ago.  For many years, though, Oxford, Sussex and York were the only English universities to use DPhil (although I've a vague suspicion that one of the four old Scottish universities did at one point, but they don't any more) — [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] 13:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Derwith&quot; ==

Just for info, I started at York in 1987, and Derwith was open then, earlier than the 1988 mentioned in the article;  I was Langwith, but had friends living in Derwith during our 1st year, and I don't think they were even the first residents there.

== Moving of the Alumni ==

The alumni is getting distractingly big, do we really need all of them listed on the page, can we have a sub page or something?

[[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 23:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

: I agree the list is getting distractingly long.  On the other hand I am not convinced that it has enough detail to warrant its own page.  We could look at [[List of Durham University people]] for precedence.[[User:Mumby|Mumby]] 08:26, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Personally I'd be in favour of removing it completely.  At the very least it could do with a serious trim.  What's the criteria for someone being notable? [[User:Bompstable|Bompstable]] 09:10, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

Should it be notable dead alumni, or just extremely notable alumni (i.e. nobel prize winners? There appears to be a lot of self-publicising here (current Univeristy of York Staff, Members of Parliament, etc), individuals that while evidently successful and/or intelligent, cannot be described as &quot;notable&quot; in the same way that Albert Einstein is. . Additionally a one word description of their role should be enough if an individual is of sufficient noteworthiness in their field. Titles such as &quot;Professor of Politics and Women's Studies, and Cross-bench peer in the House of Lords.&quot; Are ridiculously specific and far too long, perhaps &quot;Academic&quot; would surfice.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/217.17.53.133|217.17.53.133]] ([[User talk:217.17.53.133|talk]]) 02:49, 5 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== University ratings ==

(I'm posting this to all articles on UK universities as so far discussion hasn't really taken off on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities]].)

There needs to be a broader convention about which university rankings to include in articles. Currently it seems most pages are listing primarily those that show the institution at its best (or worst in a few cases). See [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Universities#University ratings]].

== Student activities ==

&quot;Recently, under the chairmanship of Soumya Basu (Schmitt), the Society started to rebrand itself to lose the 'stigma' attached to it...&quot; Can this be clarified? What was the stigma? Sexual impropriety in the woodwind section?[[User:Widmerpool|Widmerpool]] 04:12, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

Not sure this is a very balanced look at the student societies.  While some (e.g. URY, YSTV, newspapers) are clearly of note, others mentioned (e.g. debating union, hacksoc, cinematography?) don't appear to have particular merit over the ca. [http://www.yusu.org/activities/a-z.html 200 other societies and clubs at the university].  Others that are perhaps more significant, such as the Pole Exercise Club (the first pole club at any UK university and for which the founder, Lucy Misch, won 5 awards), are omitted.  (Disclaimer: I'm a member of the Pole Exercise Club.) [[User:Meloncholy|Meloncholy]] 02:31, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

: I agree with you on the issue of mentioning societies. I think there needs to be a section explaining the role of societies in a general sense and perhaps mentioning freshers fair. Instead of citing two or three societies, I think there should be a separate page listing all societies with links to each one with perhaps some small explanatory sentence. Similar to what is found on TheYorker.co.uk or the YUSU page. - I would be willing to create that page. 

: Societies are an integral part of student life that make york worth a lot more. (just want to know if anyone thinks this idea is a good one) [[User:Lexxus2010|Lexxus2010]] [[User talk:Lexxus2010|talk]] 19:01, 2 January 2008 UTC

== &quot;Getting to and from the University&quot; section ==

Is this section really appropriate for an encyclopedia article?  The articles for the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield, Durham, Kent, Lancaster and probably all other UK universities (I got bored) say where the campus/campuses is/are but don't go into details about bus fares and service numbers.  And it's doubly bizarre that this info appears ahead of the list of academic departments.  The Structure guidelines at [[WP:UNI]] don't suggest that this sort of information is necessary in a WP article. --[[User:GuillaumeTell|GuillaumeTell]] ([[User talk:GuillaumeTell|talk]]) 22:37, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
: I agree.  A link to [http://www.york.ac.uk/np/maps/ the University's &quot;How to find us&quot; page] tucked away somewhere would be better.  --[[User:RobertG|RobertG]] &amp;#9836; [[User talk:RobertG|talk]] 10:17, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== Crest/shield ==

The shied we have on the info box is incredibly small. If anyone could get hold of a larger image of the university's shield or perhaps its crest (although that one's only allowed in the presence of the Chancellor, isn't it?) then I think it would be a vast improvement to the overall appearance of the article.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.148.107.148|78.148.107.148]] ([[User talk:78.148.107.148|talk]]) 18:57, 5 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I can confirm that the shield is the simpler design, available for use by any department at any time, but the more colourful and elaborate crest is only meant to be used at events where the Chancellor is present.

:Strictly speaking, the correct term for the full thing is a '[[coat of arms]]' or 'achievement'.  The 'crest' properly refers only to the bit right at the top - in this case the two crossed keys. -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 14:43, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

Most other university pages display the coat of arms; it seems to be the uni's overzealous rebranding which has wiped all traces of it from the Internet. Based on the copies of it I've seen in some departments and some small images I found online I've created a copy of it for my own study -- unless there are any objections I'll upload it soon.

I don't think we should be using the shield/crest/coat of arms at all. See http://www.york.ac.uk/communications/publications/visual-identity/graphics/. It says the crest &quot;is used only on formal occasions when the Chancellor is present, such as graduation&quot;. The Chancellor is not present and I think we should use a logo much like: http://www.york.ac.uk/media/communications/visualidexamples/shield-full-strength.gif or maybe http://www.york.ac.uk/media/communications/visualidexamples/logo.gif [[User:Pfbray|Pfbray]] ([[User talk:Pfbray|talk]]) 02:17, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
:I disagree for a couple of different reasons.  Firstly, that comment about the coat of arms only being used on formal occasions comes from the University's internal policies regarding its visual identity pertaining to material published by the University.  Wikipedia, not being a publication of the University of York, is not bound by those policies.  Secondly, from what I understand, the University's logo is copyright and would require a fair-use justification, low-resolution image, and all that sort of stuff, whereas what we have now is an interpretation (which can be copyrighted but which in this case has graciously been CC-licensed by its creator) of a heraldic blazon (which cannot in itself be copyrighted). -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 10:44, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

== &quot;All students and all departments are allocated to a college&quot; ==

That's what it says in the 2nd paragraph of the lead.  However,
* the '''Heslington Campus''' section, 1st para, says ''Most of the university's arts departments occupy premises in the college buildings, while many of the science departments have their own buildings''.
* the '''Colleges''' section further down says ''Some of the university's academic departments have their headquarters in one of the college building complexes''.
So - which is correct?  Also, it's fair enough to briefly include the info, whatever it should be, in the lead, but surely it shouldn't appear more than once (perhaps expanded) elsewhere. &lt;font color=&quot;forestgreen&quot;&gt;[[User:GuillaumeTell|'''Guillaume''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:GuillaumeTell|''Tell'']]&lt;/font&gt; 11:00, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
: They are both correct, I think.  Students and academics are allocated to one of the colleges, no matter which department they are in, and no matter which college (if any) houses their department.  Formal teaching and research take place mostly in the departments; each college's undergraduate students have their tutorials mainly with academics allocated to their college.  I think each college has its own [[Provost (education)|provost]], and makes separate provision for the pastoral care of its students.  --[[User:RobertG|RobertG]] &amp;#9836; [[User talk:RobertG|talk]] 11:39, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
::Perhaps I should have made myself clearer.  The three quotations above from the article were intended to point out that there are conflicting statements about departments, not about students.  Are all departments allocated to a college?  Are some arts departments not located in college buildings?  How many (out of how many) of the science departments have their own [non-college-located] buildings?  Are there more departments that do not have their HQs in college buildings than those that do? --&lt;font color=&quot;forestgreen&quot;&gt;[[User:GuillaumeTell|'''Guillaume''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:GuillaumeTell|''Tell'']]&lt;/font&gt; 15:19, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

:::When we talk about of a department being &quot;in&quot; a college, there's not much more of a specific relationship than that.  Most colleges (not James or Halifax) have a bit of space that's used for tutorial rooms and for academics' offices, so one or two departments will be based in those rooms.  It was designed this way so that there was no need for specialised buildings for each department.  The department does not &quot;belong&quot; to the college in any way except in the fact that it happens to use rooms in the college buildings.  Most tutorial rooms are centrally timetabled and can be used for anything by any department, or they can be booked by individual students and societies.

:::As it happens, in general, science subjects tend to have rather more specific needs than arts subjects in terms of what is available to them.  Academics and students may well need easy access to a laboratory and a workshop, for example, which might be awkward to place in a college.  Thus the sciences have generally been given their own separate buildings to allow for this, whereas art subjects which don't have the same requirements use space in colleges.  This isn't an exact split - notably, Maths is based in college while Music has its own building.  But it's a general trend.

:Only if the University agrees and follows suit; the article is, after all, about the University and not the students' union (of which I used to be a member more years ago than I care to remember).

== Head of Sociology? ==

Your article might be out of date in  parts; it claims that the head of Sociology at the university is Professor Roger Burrows.
York's website however advertises Professor Mike Savage (not the American radio host) to be their head of department: http://www.york.ac.uk/sociology/undergraduate/.

== Main image ==

Due to a few reversions of my replacement of the [[:File:University_of_York_coat_of_arms.svg|user-created unofficial crest]] (sometimes known as the crest of the Vice Chancellor) as opposed to the [[:File:University_of_York_Shield.png|university's official shield]] as the main image in the infobox, I shall post a full rationale for the change:
# The coat of arms is a community created piece of artwork by the user Paggley, it does not represent the university in any official capacity
# According to the university's visual identity guidelines (http://www.york.ac.uk/communications/publications/visual-identity/graphics/) the crest is 'only to be used formal occasions when the Chancellor is present, such as graduation'. The shield is used as part of the logo in all other circumstances, and represents the university in an official capacity.
# The shield is used to represent the university in official outlets, such as on all pages of the university website (http://www.york.ac.uk), and further on the university's official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/universityofyork), and the university's official Twitter account (https://twitter.com/UniOfYork)
# Many other university pages use the shield as the main pictorial reference. See [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Chicago]], [[University College London]] etc.

I'm not clear on Wikipedia's rules on how to deal with circumstances like this, I have reverted the change once but I am wary to do so again. I will inform the users who have made the reverts to my change that I have made this post, and go onto replace the crest with the shield, linking to this post in the edit description. Thanks &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; #171717; font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt; - [[User:blake-|blake]]&lt;span style=&quot;color:#171716&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Sorfane|-]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17:28, 3 September 2012 (UTC)

:First of all, thanks very much for taking the time to explain your thoughts - it's much appreciated.  I don't feel ''very'' strongly one way or the other, but I do think the coat of arms is elegant, and it would be nice if it could be incorporated into the article somewhere.  In response to your points:
# It doesn't need to represent the University in any official capacity, it just needs to be a correct depiction of the heraldic [[blazon]] (the formal description of the arms in question), which it is.  To the best of my knowledge, you can't copyright a blazon, and while you can copyright a specific representation thereof, anyone is free to draw their own interpretation and either copyright that or (as Paggley has helpfully done) release it under a CC or similar license.  It's entirely legal to use it for educational or factual purposes - the only problems arise if it's used in a fraudulent, libellous or otherwise misrepresentative way, and even then there's only been one actual [[Court of Chivalry|prosecution]] in the last few hundred years.
# The University's visual identity guidelines don't apply to us - they're internal procedures to be followed for official University publications.
# This is fair comment - I guess that if it's the image most widely associated with the University then perhaps we should use it too.
# I'm not sure it matters overly what other university pages do, unless the Wikipedia style guidelines specify a general procedure to be followed.  As a counterexample, the [[University of Warwick]] page uses the coat of arms rather than the logo.
:So, how about we keep the shield logo where it is because, as you point out, it is used more widely than the coat of arms, and is thus more recognisably associated with the University.  But maybe we can fit the arms into the article somewhere else, because they are rather smart, and it seems a shame to bin them after Paggley went to all the effort of creating a freely-licensed version. -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 19:07, 3 September 2012 (UTC)
::I sincerely apologise for being so delayed in getting back to you on this, I'm just not too active on Wikipedia any more. Appreciate your compromise, and I certainly do feel that the coat of arms deserves a place in the article - especially due to its origin. I'll leave the placement up to you or another user, I've never felt too comfortable with how Wikipedia decides to format these things!

:::It's taken me ages to get around to this - sorry about that, and thanks again for discussing all this in such a cordial manner.

== Buses ==

A couple of times over the last week or so, the section on bus routes and timetables has been deleted and then re-added by someone else.  Perhaps we should try to come to a consensus about whether that section should be included in the article or not.  My view is that it shouldn't be included: this is an encyclopaedia rather than a travel guide, and the exact details of local bus services are really the responsibility and purview of the York tourist information offices and the local bus companies.  What does everyone else think?  -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 15:49, 13 January 2013 (UTC)
:Have a look at [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Josh24B/Archive|this lengthy list which started last July and has mushroomed hither and thither ever since]].

== University Lake ==

The phrase &quot;The Campus Lake, officially Scullion Lake,[28] [29] [30] is the largest plastic-bottomed lake in Europe,[31]&quot; bothers me. Mainly because this appears to be incorrect, and unfortunately a mistake that's being replicated because of the fact that it's stated in Wikipedia, and other online publications appear to have used Wikipedia as a source. 

There's no mention of Scullion Lake on the University's own website. Which is unusual if it's an official name (but of course it doesn't absolutely rule it out). The only references online, included those given in the updated citation, appear after the original update to Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_York&amp;oldid=531081171. 

I'd really like to make sure that Wikipedia distributes correct information, and I think the evidence points to this being a error that's propagating itself almost because of Wikipedia. Does anyone else feel strongly about this? [[User:Irquista|Irquista]] ([[User talk:Irquista|talk]]) 09:25, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

:I'm unconvinced as well. I was at York in the early to mid-1990s, and I don't remember anyone ever calling it &quot;Scullion Lake&quot; then.  A few possibilities occur to me: (a) it's not, and never has been, called Scullion Lake, (b) it is/was officially called that, but in practice almost nobody knew about it and hence everyone just called it &quot;the lake&quot;, or (c) it was  named that relatively recently, possibly after some benefactor or other dignitary, but not in a way that the University have seen fit to publicise.  I agree that the supporting sources are a bit flimsy (brief references in an unofficial website, an article in the local paper, and an item on a building trade press site), and all of them feel a bit like they've got the name from this very article without checking it properly.  (Also, there doesn't seem to be any consensus on whether it's &quot;Scullion Lake&quot;, &quot;Scullions Lake&quot; or &quot;Scullion's Lake&quot;.) It might be true, but equally it could be a joke perpetrated by a few students, and without some more official sources there's no real way of telling. -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 18:11, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

::I would like to reiterate the doubts shared by other users about the name of the lake. Anectdotal research confirms other editors suspicous that the Scullion's lake name is a hoax which was started in the last couple of years. A small number of webpages published in the last year refer to Scullion's lake however it is more than likely that this is as a result to finding the name on wikipedia itself. A number of the sources you have presented do not appear to be real, for example 'The Offical University of York Guide 2012' is catergorically not a real source. It may be that this source actually has a different 'real name' however otherwise this is provided edits will be considered vandalism. The University does not in any literature I can find ever refer to the lake as Scullion's lake suggesting that even if it was once given this name that it has fallen into disuse. To show the University does not use the name please see for example: [http://www.york.ac.uk/about/campus/wildlife/ here] and [http://www.york.ac.uk/about/campus/landmarks/ here].

:::Something just occurred to me that might add weight to the hoax/in-joke hypothesis: [[Skullion|James Skullion]] is one of the central characters in Tom Sharpe's satirical novels [[Porterhouse Blue]] and  [[Grantchester Grind]]. He's a pretty despicable person (a corrupt head porter, and later Master, of a fictional Cambridge college) and it's possible  somebody thought it might be fun to start a rumour that York's lake is named after him. Anyway, I think you're right that we don't have any reliable source confirming that the lake is actually called that, and quite a bit of evidence that it isn't. -- [[User:Nicholas Jackson|Nicholas Jackson]] ([[User talk:Nicholas Jackson|talk]]) 23:10, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
