== Petrol Loco? ==

I have removed the following:
*[[1902]] - [[Petrol Loco]], the first prototype [[gasoline]]-powered &quot;locomobile&quot; ([[automobile]]), is completed. 

I can find no verification for a &quot;petrol loco&quot; created in 1902. Can anyone verify this? [[User:Kingturtle|Kingturtle]] 06:14, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== [[Great American Boycott]] ==
Please add may 1 2006 as teh american boycott. a day with out a immigrant. no work no school. no buying, no selling. all america and even mexico boycottt walmart. mcdonalds and other american stores

== First unsolicited email / spam ==
Quote for May 1: 
&quot;1978 - The first e-mail spam was sent by a DEC marketing representative to every ARPANET address on the west coast of the United States.&quot;

From where does this claim originate? (It is not referenced in any of linked articles.) This is an important claim which requires some references. -- [[User:Liberty Miller|Libertas]] 10:30, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

Update: I found Brad Templeton's Blog, which appears to be as reliable as internet pages can be; see http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html . Note, however,
that even he admits that the email is only &quot;Possibly the first spam&quot;.
So I guess we can consider http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html 
as the reference. -- [[User:Liberty Miller|Libertas]] 10:45, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Ayrton Senna==
Shouldn't we put [[Ayrton Senna]] here, who died at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]] on 1 May 1994? Mainly because this is probably the most memorable death by a majority of F1 fans... --[[user:Skully Collins|Skully Collins]] &lt;sub&gt;[[Wikipedia:Editor review/Skully Collins|Review Me! Please?]]&lt;/sub&gt; 15:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:Someone has listed him under deaths now.  [[User:Fabricationary|Fabricationary]] 23:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
::Yeah, but surely he is notable enough to be put into the ''On This Day'', isn't he? --[[user:Skully Collins|Skully Collins]] &lt;sub&gt;[[Wikipedia:Editor review/Skully Collins|Review Me! Please?]]&lt;/sub&gt; 12:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Probably not.  If you read [[Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries#Criteria_for_listing_items_on_this_set_of_pages|the criteria for selected anniversaries]], you'll see that &quot;the event and the selected article (bolded item) needs to be listed in the Events section of its corresponding day of the year article.&quot;  Deaths are listed in deaths, not events.  [[User:Fabricationary|Fabricationary]] 15:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

==Error?==
&quot;# 1945 - Soviet troops raise the Soviet Flag over the Reichstag, in Berlin&quot;
However, this event is listed as May 2nd in the chronology of [[1945]]

== [[Labor Day]] ==

For the sake of clarification, the reason it seemed reasonable to remove Labor Day for the May 1 article is that the [[Labor Day]] article makes no mention of the holiday occurring on May 1 in any other country. This could surely be a fault in the article, but it seems that if the May 1 article makes the claim, it should at least be described in the Labor Day article to avoid this kind of confusion.

:Good point.  It ''is'' the case the workers are recognized in most countries on May 1, but we need to have that in the appropriate article.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User_talk:Arthur_Rubin|(talk)]] 21:57, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
:Found it.  It's [[Labour Day]].  &amp;mdash; [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User_talk:Arthur_Rubin|(talk)]] 21:59, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
::That def works better. [[User:Murderbike|Murderbike]] ([[User talk:Murderbike|talk]]) 22:03, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

== Birthdays ==

Consider adding Yasmina Reza.

She has her own wikipedia article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasmina_Reza

That says either 1959 or 1960.

The New Yorker, March 16, 2009, has it at 1959.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:WoodenBooks|WoodenBooks]] ([[User talk:WoodenBooks|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/WoodenBooks|contribs]]) 21:20, 18 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Error in Birthday ==

Just noting that it says that Justin Bieber was born May 1st, 1994, when he was actually born March 1st, so he should not be on that list.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.247.130.182|98.247.130.182]] ([[User talk:98.247.130.182|talk]]) 04:14, 15 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Bin Laden death reports==
So far, reports indicate that Bin Laden may have been killed within the last week.  If that's the case his death should not be listed on this page.  Once the true details of his death are found and a global impact of the reports can be measured, the fact that it was announced on this day '''might''' go here under the events section. -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Mufka&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(u)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 03:19, 2 May 2011 (UTC)

== Guam commonwealth ==

I believe that Guam is actually an organized, unincorporated territory rather than a commonwealth as per [[Guam Organic Act of 1950|Guam Organic Act]], 1 Aug 1950. For references see {{CIA World Factbook link|gg|Guam}} and {{USC|48|1421}}. --[[User:Johann1870|Johann1870]] ([[User talk:Johann1870|talk]]) 12:45, 2 May 2011 (UTC)

== Edit request from Bendernas, 2 May 2011 ==

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
Add Osama Bin Laden to deaths on May 1st? (B. 1957)?

&lt;!-- End request --&gt;
[[User:Bendernas|Bendernas]] ([[User talk:Bendernas|talk]]) 14:47, 2 May 2011 (UTC)

:When it happened, it was May 1st here, but May 2nd there. I believe we're going with the local time for this one, so his death is being recorded as May 2nd, not May 1st, which is why he isn't on this page. &lt;font color=&quot;silver&quot;&gt;[[User:Silver seren|Silver]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Silver seren|seren]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Silver seren|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 2 May 2011 (UTC)
