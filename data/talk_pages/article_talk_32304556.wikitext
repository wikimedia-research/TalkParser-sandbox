'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Nathankresshubby, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!  I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Northwood High]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]

* [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]

Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;[[User:Gurt Posh|Gurt Posh]] ([[User talk:Gurt Posh|talk]]) 14:19, 4 July 2011 (UTC)

Please refrain from introducing inappropriate pages, such as [[:Northwood High]], to Wikipedia. Doing so is not in accordance with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]]. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Northwood High|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-vandalism-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Gurt Posh|Gurt Posh]] ([[User talk:Gurt Posh|talk]]) 14:19, 4 July 2011 (UTC)
