I wanted to let you know that I reverted one of [[Special:Contributions/156.3.54.203|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;—the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History%20of%20Thailand&amp;diff=656666474 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:History of Thailand]]— because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Donner60|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Donner60|Donner60]] ([[User talk:Donner60|talk]]) 21:40, 15 April 2015 (UTC)
