The bot has removed all the RfCs from the request boards.

Hi Chris! I was thinking of creating a bot to generate noticeboard summaries similiar to WP:DASHBOARD, but for the talk pages in this template {{tl|Christianity-related talkpages}}. I have experience in Visual Basic. Do you think it would be difficult? Thanks! &amp;ndash; [[user:Lionelt|Lionel]] &lt;sup&gt;([[user talk:Lionelt|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 11:59, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

Hi Chris, hope you're well.  I'm going to make a separate bot account to edit the fully protected [[User:Fbot/Replace]].  I'll file a new BRFA for it. If it's not too much trouble, and when you have time, could you remove the statement about having [[User:Fbot]] flagged as an admin?
