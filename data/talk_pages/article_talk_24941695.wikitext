'''Welcome!'''

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{BASEPAGENAME}}|your contributions]]{{#if:|, such as the one you made to [[:{{{art}}}]]|}}. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages you might like to see:

You are welcome to continue editing articles without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but I highly recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles.

If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] ({{ROOTPAGENAME}}) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]!

Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:State Property (group)]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=323599401&amp;oldid=322280768 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] from Wikipedia.  The external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.  I removed the following link(s): http://www.myspace.com/statepropertythamovement (matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bmyspace\.com).&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to undo the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks! --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 01:45, 3 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, please ignore this notice.&lt;/small&gt;
