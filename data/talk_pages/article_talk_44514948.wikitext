[[Image:Ambox warning blue.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''Welcome to Wikipedia.'''

Please note that you '''may not use a username that represents the name of a company, group, organization, product, or website'''. Examples of usernames that are not allowed include &quot;XYZ Company&quot;, &quot;MyWidgetsUSA.com&quot;, and &quot;Trammel Museum of Art&quot;. However, you are invited to use a username that ''contains'' such a name if it identifies you personally, such as &quot;Mark at WidgetsUSA&quot;, &quot;Jack Smith at the XY Foundation&quot;, and &quot;WidgetFan87&quot;. 

Please also note that Wikipedia does not allow accounts to be [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Sharing accounts|shared by multiple people]], and that you [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion|may not advocate for or promote]] any company, group, organization, product, or website, regardless of your username.
