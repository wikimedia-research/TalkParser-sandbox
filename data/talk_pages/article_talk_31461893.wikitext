[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Faye Valentine]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG produces very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|373943}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again. 
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Faye Valentine]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faye+Valentine&amp;diff=423438811&amp;oldid=423249277 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/Gush01|Gush01]] [[User:Gush01|(u)]] [[User talk:Gush01|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.964148 on 2011-04-11T01:44:47+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 373943 --&gt;.

If you continue to [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalize]] Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Faye Valentine]] with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Valentine?diff=423444200 this edit], you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;—[[User:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;mc10&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 02:27, 11 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism3 --&gt;

&lt;div style=clear: both&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is your '''last warning'''; the next time you harm Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Faye Valentine]] with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Valentine?diff=423444381 this edit], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing without further notice'''. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;—[[User:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;mc10&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 02:28, 11 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism4 --&gt;

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Faye Valintine]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Faye Valintine]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Faye Valintine|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Faye Valintine|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;—[[User:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;mc10&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/MC10|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt; 02:34, 11 April 2011 (UTC)
