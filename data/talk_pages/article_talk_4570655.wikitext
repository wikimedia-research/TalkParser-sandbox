== Your [[User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof|VandalProof]] Application ==

Dear Bakanov,

Thank you for applying for [[User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof|VandalProof!]] ''(VP)''. As you may know, VP is a very powerful program, and in fact with the new 1.2 version release it has even more power. As such we must uphold strict protocols before approving a new applicant. Regretfully, I have chosen to decline your application at this time. The reason for this is that {{{1|for security reasons, VandalProof's creator requires it's users to have made 250 edits to articles, which you have not}}}. Please note it is nothing personal by any means, and we certainly welcome you to apply again in the not too distant future. ''Thank you for your interest in VandalProof.'' - '''''[[User:Stollery|Gl]][[User:Stollery/Esperanza|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;]][[User:Stollery|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;n&lt;/font&gt;]]''''' ''&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Stollery|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Stollery|C]]&lt;/sub&gt; [[User:Stollery|(Stollery)]]&lt;/small&gt;'' 21:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== About reverts ==

Is there a reason for your revert of my edits to [[WP:LTA]]? I've been attempting to clear it up steadily as it's currently in a poor state. [[User:68.39.174.238|68.39.174.238]] 17:00, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
:It might have been an accident while sweeping the recent edits by anonymous users - I cannot recount rolling it back, and never documented it. My apologies for doing this. [[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] 13:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

== The Gary guy page! ==

Hi there

Thanks for this catch.  I confess to be completely ignorant about footy but the vandalism here over the past couple of days has been considerable and I've had difficulty finding &quot;good&quot; reverts.  There are at least 3 IP addresses and 2 registered users playing games here (the IP are not the same organisations).  It's on my watch list too - hope the day is good for you - cheers -- [[User:NigelR|Nigel]]  &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:NigelR|Talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:Good in terms of fish caught it certainly is. In the past three hours I've had to revert 32 malicious edits, a number which would've been far higher if Omicronpersei8 didn't keep creeping ahead of me, no matter how often I jump ahead of him :)

:With a bit of luck they'll give up on vandalising the Bollan page soon, but I guess our chances are somewhat dim there. Have a good hunt! [[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] 11:37, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

::Spotted your history and saw you'd been busy!  As a PS I'm not even sure we have the &quot;right&quot; revert now (but - very quietly - I doubt he is that important &lt;g&gt;).  Catch you round - cheers -- [[User:NigelR|Nigel]]  &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:NigelR|Talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== Vandalism? ==

Hi, regarding your revert of the question asked at [[Wikipedia:Reference desk/Miscellaneous]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=69003219]) - why is this marked as vandalism? It is in allcaps, which is annoying, but it's entirely possible that it's a legitimate query. [[User:Ziggurat|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#DC2163;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/font&gt;iggurat]] 11:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
:The phrase ''WHY NOT SOME MORE?'' suggested to me this was by no means a serious edit. This may indeed have been a mistake - if the supposed vandal responds regarding this revert I will of course extend my apologies and increase my 'screwup count' by one. Thanks, [[User:Bakanov|{{{2|Bakanov}}}]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 11:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
::More than one sperm at a time, presumably - I wouldn't interpret it as frivolous, although I would guess that the asker is probably pretty young :) If you don't object, I'll restore the edit and answer it, and see if the editor responds well or vandalistically. [[User:Ziggurat|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#DC2163;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/font&gt;iggurat]] 12:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
:::I see... No objections to restoring the edit; if this is indeed a legitimate query I should never have rolled it back. --[[User:Bakanov|{{{2|Bakanov}}}]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 12:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
:::Well, I've added a partial reply; we'll see if/when they return. All the best, [[User:Ziggurat|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#DC2163;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/font&gt;iggurat]] 12:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Regina ==


What I have added to wikipedia concerning the entry Regina, is completely factual and intended to assist the reader. It is a fact that the city Regina rhymes with &quot;vagina&quot;. This is a common mistake for people talking about our city, and the clarification is useful to the reader. Please reinsert my addition.

Retrieved from &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NigelR&quot;

:Its proper pronunciation in is already listed in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] - there is no need to add that it rhymes with &quot;vagina&quot;. I apologise for warning you for a good-faith edit, but will not undo my action. --[[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 16:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

For some reason the IPA pronunciation comes across as gibberish.  One cannot see how to pronounce Regina properly.  I have checked this on several computers, including the computer available at the City of Regina, and the IPA does not show up properly.  That is why I think the rhyming is more helpful to the readers.

:It is against policy. I suggest you be bold and set the IPA straight, as I am not familiar with the proper pronunciation. --[[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 17:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

::Must stop meeting like this!  &quot;You say Regina I say ...&quot;  I've answered to IP talk page - not nonsense but not necessary.  Catch you again I'm certain -- [[User:NigelR|Nigel]]  &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:NigelR|Talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Cristiano Ronaldo error mistake ==

I have done no such thing, I did not even look at the page, let alone edit it. You have made a mistake, I believe. I have left all positive contributions to Wiki, but how did my ISP number turn up, as I didnt even go on that page?

:[[User talk:82.10.93.147|82.10.93.147]], I have no idea how you ended up in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cristiano_Ronaldo&amp;action=history article's history] if you didn't make that edit. Or perhaps I do. If you have a dynamic IP (especially if you're using [[WP:AOL|AOL]]), your IP might change periodically. That's one of the many disadvantages of remaining anonymous.
:Unfortunately, your situation is like that of a suspected killer with his face on tape and his fingerprints all over the murder weapon. If you really didn't do anything, it may be advisable to get a username. That way you can be certain only to be held accountable for your own actions, aside from other advantages you get from signing up. The best of luck --[[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 20:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[User_talk:213.103.236.34|the One time pad thing ]] ==

It wasn't an experiment; I think the change was correct: 'elementary' means that something is an elemental part of the whole under discussion. The original version was thus wrong (the cited concepts are elementary with respect to one time pads). I suspect the original author meant non-trivial but I prefer the less-convoluted hard-to-do. Encyclopedias should be concise and elegant but usually not fancyful.
:&lt;Moved to bottom of page&gt; You are absolutely right. I have rolled back my edit and would like to extend my sincere apologies for this screw-up. Wish I could say it will never happen again. 

:However, there is ''one'' thing you can do to help RC patrollers avoid mistakes like this - by providing an edit summary you can take away most doubts about an edit. Cheers, [[User:Bakanov|Bakanov]] ([[User talk:Bakanov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bakanov|contribs]]) 11:07, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

::I should start logging in too :)

==Assitance??==
Can you look at this one - [[Leonard Susskind]].  Think I'm getting the reverts right but he is giving me grief and placing warnings on my page!!

==WikiProject Disambiguation Talk Request==
This is a form message being sent to all WikiProject Disambiguation participants. I recently left a [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Disambiguation#Adopting_Pages_and_Link_Repair_Banner|proposed banner idea on the WikiProject Disambiguation talk page]] and I would appreciate any input you could provide. Before it can be approved or denied, I would prefer a lot of feedback from multiple participants in the project. So if you have the time please join in the discussion to help improve the WikiProject. Keep up the good work in link repair and thanks for your time. [[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] 21:17, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== World's Smallest Political Quiz userbox ==

You may be interested in [[User:Audacity/Userboxes/WSPQ]], which is a replacement for the old Political Chart userbox. The new userbox takes the two variables (economic and personal freedom), calculates which political alignment they place you into (Statist, Libertarian, Liberal, Centrist, or Conservative), and links your userpage to the appropriate category.

Please reply to [[User talk:Audacity]], as I will not be watching your talk page. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Audacity|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Λυδ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;lime&quot;&gt;α&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;cιτγ&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/b&gt; 07:37, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link fixing one-day contest==

I have decided to put on a mini-contest within the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links/November 2013|November 2013 monthly disambiguation contest]], on Saturday, November 23 (UTC). I will personally give a $20 Amazon.com gift card to the disambiguator who fixes the most links on that server-day ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/dplbot/ch/dab_challenge.php see the project page for details on scoring points]). Since we are not geared up to do an automated count for that day, at 00:00, 23 November 2013 (UTC) (which is 7:00 PM on November 22, EST), I'll take a screenshot of the project page leaderboard. I will presume that anyone who is not already listed on the leaderboard has precisely &lt;i&gt;nine&lt;/i&gt; edits. At 01:00, 24 November 2013 (UTC) (8:00 PM on November 23, EST), I'll take a screenshot of the leaderboard at that time (the extra hour is to give the board time to update), and I will determine from that who our winner is. I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; credit links fixed by turning a [[WP:DABCONCEPT]] page into an article, but you'll have to let me know me that you did so. Here's to a fun contest. Note that according to the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links/The Daily Disambig|Daily Disambig]], we currently have under 256,000 disambiguation links to be fixed. If everyone in the disambiguation link fixers category were to fix 500 links, we would have them all done - so aim high! Cheers!
