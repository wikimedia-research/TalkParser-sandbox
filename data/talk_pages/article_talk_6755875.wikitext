:Having looked into this a bit, I think the original text was actually adapted from an obituary in a University of Southern California newsletter ([http://uscnews.usc.edu/hscweekly/detail.php?recordnum=11053 here]), which predates the Free Radical Research obit by a few months. The text, at least now, is no longer so identical to that source as to seem like a straight copyvio, so I've just remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copypaste}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag.
