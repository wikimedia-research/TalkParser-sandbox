== Liberal Arts ==
&quot;Liberal Arts&quot; is a much broader field than just music.  Why does this this degree limit itself to only that segment, according to this article?  [[User:Shoreranger|Shoreranger]] ([[User talk:Shoreranger|talk]]) 16:55, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

== Doctor of Liberal Studies ==
There are universities that offer a DLA which is similar to a Doctor of Liberal Studies. Perhaps the two articles should be merged?

'''Question and comment'''. Do any universities in the United States or other English-speaking country offer a degree with this name?  If so, they should be mentioned in the article.  If degrees with this name are only awarded in Hungary, then keep the current name. [[User:Wbm1058|Wbm1058]] ([[User talk:Wbm1058|talk]]) 01:34, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
