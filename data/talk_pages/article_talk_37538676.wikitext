[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not write or add to an article about  yourself, as you apparently did at [[:User:Sutton Porter/Sutton Porter]]. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]] is ''strongly'' discouraged – see our guideline on [[WP:AUTOBIO|writing  autobiographies]]. If you create such an article, it may be deleted. If what you have done in life is genuinely notable and can be verified according to our policy for [[WP:PEOPLE|articles about living  people]], someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]]). If you wish to add to an existing article about yourself, please propose the changes on its talk page. Please understand that this is an encyclopedia and not a personal web space or social networking site. If your article has already been deleted, please see: [[Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?|Why was my page deleted?]], and if you feel the deletion was an error, please discuss it with the deleting administrator.
