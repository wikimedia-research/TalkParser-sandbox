==Marijuana== 
...which then had less potency than it does today, was prized as much for its iconoclastic, illicit nature as for its effect.'' Whoever put this in - sure about that? -- [[User:Tillwe|till we *)]] 00:13, Aug 26, 2003 (UTC)

:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;potency&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; I don't have a cite, but it is something that I've heard mentioned in informational meetings.  It is asserted by those who wish to see less widespread use of marijuana, when speaking to parents who participated in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.  &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;source of prizedness&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Perhaps this is speculation in part, as it is a generalization, but it is certainly what I remember of the movement. I will notify the relevant Wikipedians who may be able to speak from more personal experience than I can. [[User:Kat|Kat]] 14:52, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::The second part is probably true, but could use a cite.  The first is defiantly false.  This comparison has been well-publicized by the DEA and other groups, but it is based on comparing weed seized at the Mexican border back then with weed hydroponically grown in the US today (schwag vs. kb). I will remove the claim.--[[User:TUF-KAT|Tuf-Kat]]

:::Oh dear. I haven't touched dope in a long time, but yes, anyone of my generation (I'm born in '54) who has been around drugs can assure you that what people smoke now is much stronger than what was commonly smoked in the 60s. People today smoke bud, and it's bud from plants that has been bred for potency for some time. My generation, when young, smoked mostly leaves, and when you bought a given quantity you had to card out the seeds and stems yourself. [[User:206.124.153.89|206.124.153.89]] 22:47, 26 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::I guess it depends who's buying. I'm a schwag man, myself -- seeds and stems and all. Maybe it is true that there is more potent marijuana available today than there was in the sixties, but I don't think its share of the market is as big as you make it.  A lot of smokers can't afford sixty, seventy, eighty bucks for an eighth. And people have been smoking and breeding stronger weed for centuries -- just like wheat or maize or apples or walnuts -- that's not to say that the science hasn't developed a lot since the sixties, but 60's weed was also cultivated. Hydroponics was probably a new thing at the time (If it existed at all?).--[[User:TUF-KAT|Tuf-Kat]] 06:11, Dec 27, 2003 (UTC)

This is 2 years later, but I'd just like to note something -- People misunderstand and misconstrue the word &quot;potency&quot;. You could be &quot;really bad&quot; or &quot;really potent&quot; weed in the 60's, and you can now. Pot as a whole has not gotten more or less potent. If it were more potent, it would actually be more healthy. It's funny how the anti-drug propaganda mentions that and shoots itself in the foot like that, as a side note. And, 80 BUCKS FOR AN EIGHTH? MY GOD MAN WHAT KIND OF EIGHTHS ARE YOU BUYING? I buy excellent, excellent marijuana for maximum 40$ an eighth, and only 80 if im buying the most potent stuff in the world, which is 40 a gram!

Or did I misunderstand the statement?

Sorry, I'm stoned. bahaha.--[[User:Lockeownzj00|Lockeownzj00]] 02:59, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I've seen $80 before (For very good stuff), though never paid more than $50.--[[User:TUF-KAT|Tuf-Kat]] 21:53, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

Even if it was 'very good stuff'? (Which is, as you said, worth 30$ more?)

:To put this debate to bed, it appears that:

:&lt;small&gt;In the 1960's and prior to that, the good commercial marijuana available to most smokers had a THC content of about 3% to 6% and the best sinsemilla marijuana was about 10% to 15% THC. Some sources say that dope with THC content of 1% to 4% was considered good stuff in the 1960's.&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;In the year 2005, the good commercial marijuana available to most smokers had a THC content of about 8% to 15% and the best sinsemilla marijuana was about 25% to 35% THC. Some reports have weed with 50% THC content being produced by some advanced growers.
:http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/mj029.htm&lt;/small&gt;

:Or just do a google search of &quot;thc content&quot; &quot;more potent&quot;, and you'll find a gazillion sites, many with reliable provenance. The best evidence I've seen, though anecdotal, is that all the old hippies I know who still smoke (quite a few) have told me that the grass today is for more powerful.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] 00:39, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

Yes, pot is stronger now than it was then. It's been getting steadily stronger, 80s pot was stronger than 60s pot, and weaker than 2006 pot. It isn't simply a matter of THC content as there are scores of psychoactive cannabinoids.  Some of the strains that people smoke today are descended from strains that didn't even exist as recently as 20 years ago. Even the government-grown pot has increased in potency, and pot has been more aggressively bred for psychoactive effect, by a  more knowedgeable group of horticulturists than before.  Even hash has become stronger, made from stronger pot.  Of course you can't use what I'm saying in wikipedia, it's [[WP:Original research]], but trust me it's quite true that pot is much much much stronger.  Funny thing though, when it was a felony drug, I saw pot smoked in public a lot more, in places like Dennys, now that it's a misdemeanor, the only public use I usually see -- or smell -- is at band concerts.  [[User:Pedant|Pedant]] 05:57, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

Diffintly stronger than it used to be The age (melbourne) &quot;good weekend magazine&quot; recently (may?) did a front cover story on this very issue. It stated that the increase in pot induced psycosis may be due to potency ANd the nasty chemicals they add to &quot;hydro&quot; - particularly if the crop hasn't been &quot;flushed&quot; properly befor harvest.  The old Hippys of Ninbin (pot capital of oz) and many &quot;neo-hippys&quot; refuse hydro and go bush - buds. Or even better , organic.  ```` [[cilstr]] 05:57, 22 August 2006

==Hiya!==

I am an aging Hippie and proud of it! What is a Hippie? It depends on who you ask! If you ask Mike Wallace, it is someone who is unconventional or acts like a young derelict! LOL! Ask me and I'll say a person who is Hip or Cool or OK or Easygoing. In the Sixties a Male Hippie had long hair and wore Tye Dye T Shirts &amp; Bell Bottom Denim Jeans. The first time I saw young men with long hair was in 1964 at JFK Airport when the Beatles arrived. Later that year I was watching NBC News Special Report and there was a Vietnam War Protest at The 1964 New York World's Fair and some young men with long hair were fighting with police on an escalator and the reporters and police were calling the protesters &quot;Hippies&quot; and noted they had long hair and were students at a University. Gabe Pressman was a reporter there. So the earliest report of a Hippie in my mind is 1964. Before that, the type were referred to as Beatniks. Hippies did not all have the same political beliefs or religious beliefs. Most Hippies were against the Vietnam War, but by 1975, everyone in America wanted out of Vietnam!

We just weren't gonna win that one. Drug use, especially Cannabis was seen by most young people whether they were Hippies or Square. It was part of the rites of passage. Most people nowadays see being a Hippie as a way guys used to get girls. It was not. It was a way of acting for rebellious youth. Hippies still exist, but the original 1964 crop is dying fast. Last I heard of any organised Counterculture was called &quot;The Rainbows&quot; and they had met in Colorado in the mid 90's. Most Hippie Communes have become defunct. Hippie music is still with us and defines the time. Hippies gave us the Apple Computer for home use and invented the PCR-DNA Test which has freed many innocent men from Prison! Hippies have created new Medicines and therapies and made life better.

Most hippies would say 'hippies' was a term invented by Look magazine, in the early 60's, it wasn't until the later 60's that people actually began embracing the term as something that applies to themselves.  If it weren't for hippies and yippies, you other folk would all be speaking 'square' today. ~~

== Are Punks Neo-Hippies? ==

Also, is [[punk ideology|punk]] a kind of neo-hippie movement? It would seem that anti-conformity, strong political concerns, rejection of military force and a spirit of rebellion are common to both movements. But is there any documented connection between the two movements?--[[User:David R Alexander|David R Alexander]] 4:11, July 16 2005

EDIT: Like my goth comment/edit above, punk is really more just a social trend/fad. The &quot;anti-conformity, strong political concerns, rejection of military force and a spirit of rebellion&quot; stuff is really to make the average &quot;punk&quot;'s shallow  exterior of Che Guevara T-Shirts, the no-longer-crazy-looking-because-every-other-punk-does-it hairstyle and jungle boots seem to have more of an actual &quot;culture&quot; they can lean back on if ever questioned of their so-called beliefs. Few of them are truly politically concerned though they'll wear plenty of anarchy/marxist/etc neo-liberal garb, and they are hardly &quot;anti-conformity&quot;. I mean the fact that i can sterotype their basic look alredy show how conforming they are within their group. Perhaps this trend was some how set off by an extension of the hippy sub-culture, but it holds much less of an impact than the hippies.

Though, what i say of the goths/punks may also hold true for the hippies as well, just that the hippy &quot;fad&quot; was much more wide spread with a bigger effect.

I think the matter of difference is &quot;tolerance&quot;: I find punk's more aggresive... Than Hippies, that is - Of course. They're more relaxed than punks, who tend to get more enemies, and don't care for the collective, but the individual.--[[User:OleMaster|OleMurder]] 00:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
::Wow, talk about generalizations of punks! Some truth, but definitely some problems. I label myself as a punk, but I don't typically dress &quot;punk&quot; because it is so cliched and lame. Punks do tend to be more aggressive, but not always. Also, while most punks aren't deeply political, there is a punk underground that does take politics very seriously (this is what I am involved in). This underground punk community actually does have some hippie influence ([[crust punk]]s especially). 
::Traditionally, punks actually rejected (often violently) the hippies for being too non-violent and sell-outs. Anyway, nowadays there is more of a mix between the groups (I wear tie-dye on occasion and listen to some folk music), but I wouldn't call punks neo-hippies by a long shot.

It's true that the average punk today hasn't the slightest notion of why or what he's wearing, but the street punk clothes, (which are most common today) are stemmed from the UK82 scene when punk was first commercialized with expensive leather jackets and a standard hair cut- mohawk, liberty spikes, etc.  Prior to the Sex Pistols and especially John Lydon there was no such thing as a punk, kids who went to &quot;punk&quot; shows were simply known as outcasts of the popular crowd.  Like the hippie, traditional punk outfits were supposed to be original, and have the D.I.Y. spirit, (do it yourself).  The original punk didn't wear boots, or mohawk, they simply dressed themselves in garbage clothes, and commonlly would peirce their bodies in an unorthodox way such as a chain from the nose to ear, or a safety pin through the cheek.

==Drugs==

''But in fact overall, drugs were not and still are not considered a central theme in hippie culture''

I removed the above statement by 205.188.116.71 because this user made an all encompassing statement leaving out very key pieces of information such as who doesn't consider drugs to be a central theme?  The “hippies”?  Americans?  Nicaragua?  What percentage of this group feels this way?  Half? 88%? This contributor also sounds like they’re coming to the defense of the hippie culture instead of listing factual information.  They could have given a key fact, statistic, quotation, or any other piece of information to defend their point. Simply saying that drugs weren’t and are still not considered a central theme is akin to me stating boldly that overall, the paint job on my car is not considered to be ugly.  I just can’t prove that. [[User:Oo64eva|'''''oo64eva (AJ)''''']] 22:25, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)

:Well, I was there, and drugs=hippies and hippies=drugs. There were those who used more, or less, than others, but the two were inseparable. To say otherwise is wishful revisionism. Such a statement may fly now, but in the 60's and 70's would have been laughed off the planet.--[[User:Doovinator|Doovinator]] 04:13, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

''Many people recall that hippies did not smoke tobacco cigarettes, and considered tobacco dangerous, but photographs from the time shows many hippies smoking cigarettes.''

I'm not sure about this. I think the hippy movement considered tobacco &quot;the drug of the establishment&quot;, and therefore refrained from using it; I doubt very much that they refrained from using it because they considered it dangerous. Also, it is worth remembering that many young people at that time would have dressed in a hippy style, even if they were not actual hippies (In the same way that dressing in &quot;gangsta&quot;-style doesn't necessarily make you a gangster), so photographs showing people with long hair and tie dyed shirts smoking cigarettes doesn't really prove much.

:I'd say it basically just wasn't thought about very much. Smoking tobacco didn't really mean much of anything one way or the other at the time; However the 'preferred' smoke, the smoke which more or less defined who was or wasn't a hippie, was certainly marijuana. If pot wasn't available, catnip or banana peels or tobacco would have to do.--[[User:Doovinator|Doovinator]] 07:50, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::My personal two-cents worth (I was at Berkeley all through the late '60s): The pot most of us smoked then was, indeed, much more powerful than what's commonly imbibed now -- not because pot was innately more powerful but because we were pretty naive and generally broke. Rather than &quot;Maui Wowie,&quot; most of us on campus got by on what George Carlin called &quot;Toledo Windowbox,&quot; and you had to smoke half a dozen to get a decent high. Regarding tobacco: Smoking simply wasn't taken seriously as a health hazard yet and most of us smoked routinely. Tobacco wasn't so much the &quot;establishment's drug&quot; (that would be martinis, etc), it was just the most easily available and cheapest (about 30 cents a pack for unfiltered Camels, as I recall). I was too busy with grad school and supporting a family to be more than a hippie &quot;fellow traveler&quot;, but I *do* miss the '60s! -----[[User:Mksmith|Michael K.

''Though hippies embodied a counterculture movement, early hippies were not particularly tolerant of homosexuality. Acceptance of homosexuality grew with the culture.''

Is this true? If so, how did [[Allen Ginsberg]] become a leader of the hippie movement? 
[[User:David R Alexander|David R Alexander]] 4:11, July 16 2005

yeah, but besides that, who exactly is that language refering to when they say &quot;early hippies&quot; and what really is the accuracy or so call &quot;verifiability&quot; of that statement? in otherwords it seems a clearcut eample of something that to my knowledge appears all over the place in the &quot;hippie&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; articles: unsupported generalization.

:I agree, generally, with the statement in the article. Remember that, while hippies were in rebellion against the previous couple of generations, they still grew up in the 1950s &amp; early '60s. Homosexuality, except in a few enclaves like the Village, was a mystery and therefore a threat to most young people. Likewise, as many hippie chicks will recall, most male hippies were also pretty unenlightened about feminism. All that eye-opening came later and most of us grew into it. -----[[User:Mksmith|Michael K. Smith]] 00:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC) 

I'd sure like to see a citation or two in support of that assertion. *Where* were they &quot;not particularly tolerant&quot;?? Lower East Side? San Fran?   *Who* ... &quot;biker&quot; hippies? Who can speak for and summarize the overall feelings and behavior of several hundred thousand people from a range of classes? In fact, since the great majority of homosexuals were still in the closet in those &quot;early hippy&quot; days -- apart from flamers -- how many &quot;early hippies&quot; would have known anyway?
As I wandered and hitched around, went to festivals, walked the streets, I don't recall hearing a single anti-gay sentiment. Logically, you'd expect &quot;hippies&quot;, whatever that connotes, to be neither more nor less tolerant than the population in general. Except that, since being &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;mellow&quot; and &quot;the love generation&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot; were commonly shared values, you'd logically expect a somewhat greater &quot;acceptance&quot; (perhaps a better word than &quot;tolerance&quot;). That was my experience. 
I've seen a lot of misrepresentation of what those days were like in the colorful &quot;histories&quot; written so far, and I don't think this article needs to reflect that crap. [[User:Twang|Twang]] 08:51, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== extreme Pro-hippie POV  ==

Now, I will admit right now, I HATE HIPPIES, and it may leave me unfit to edit this encyclopedic entry. But despite my views, this is one of the more biased entries I've seen to date on Wikipedia. This article, specifically the last two paragraphs of the POLITICS section, is so far left I thought the words were going to fall off the page. (we should all agree here, it's fairly obvious ,no?) 

I'm not just saying this because of my views towards hippies. I also despise Jane Fonda, but I think that here page is one of the better political pieces on this &quot;encyclopedia&quot;. 

Here's my suggestion to help clean this page up:

Remove all of the words in the 4th paragraph (POLITICS) that make it seem like hippies were wrongly accused of these unpatriotic acts. It was mainstream. Ask anyone who lived during this time. My uncle, a self-proclaimed hippie, said that the majority of hippies would go to airports just to berate the returning vets, as well as stoning them on college campuses. They also burned ROTC buildings on nearly every campus. This is one reason that most colleges today don't have the ROTC. Get rid of this ridiculous statement with the &quot;small radical fringe element&quot;. Most veterans, myself included (1st gulf war), believe that opposing any war in public, while it is your right under the 1st Amend., it is dishonorable, unpatriotic, treasonous, and a slap in the face to all active duty and discharged vets, thus the statement &quot;hippies did not disrespect military personnel&quot; is your opinion, and since I highly doubt that you are a member of the military, it is ill-informed.

Secondly, this kooky FBI conspiracy theory doesn't belong in an &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, and it is definitely irresponsible to tell it as if it is fact.

The last paragraph about this song is ridiculous. My dad, who returned to San Fran from Vietnam in 1973 never even heard of this song/&quot;singer&quot;. I tried to balance this out, by adding a song called &quot;Welcome Home Brother&quot; from Lloyd Marcus' &quot;United We Stand&quot; album AND I CITED IT [[http://www.proudconservative.com/music.html]], but because it tells of the disrespect on the part of &quot;flower children&quot;, the editors of this &quot;article&quot; decided it didn't belong. 

Semper fi.

:I understand that you wish to rely on your uncle's opinion that &quot;the majority of hippies would go to airports just to berate the returning vets, as well as stoning them on college campuses.&quot;  I was in the thick of things during this era, and I never knew anyone who did this.  If it had been a &quot;majority&quot; thing, I would have known someone--yet no, never, not a single person, not a single time.  We DID oppose U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and we were vehement about that. But most of us went out of our way to befriend returning vets, offering them both moral and practical support.  

:Am I saying that returning military personnel were NEVER disrespected?  No, of course not.  People get passionate about things.  Undoubtedly some hippies DID insult returning military personnel.  And I know at least two hippies who were beaten up--one, a woman, who was raped-- by military personnel who were angry at hippies.   Both of these extremes were condemnable, and neither represented the norm; both were thus &quot;fringe.&quot;  

:Please note that the historical evidence with respect to J. Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO operation is irrefutable and has nothing to do with various conspiracy theories.  I would suggest you read the one article I cited, as well as a selection of others--Google has many links to excellent original source material.   Hoover DID employ agents provacateurs in his bid to discredit those involved in the civil rights movement (Martin Luther King Jr. in particular) as well as those who opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  Hoover's agents DID perpetrate crimes that compromised the non-violent character of both of these movements, and the published record makes it clear that Hoover sent his agents out to public venues specifically to shout &quot;Baby Burners&quot; or &quot;Baby Killers&quot; at returning vets so that these stories would feature prominently in the news.  Did others who had no connection to Hoover's COINTELPRO operation join in?  Probably so, but this sort of behavior was roundly condemned in every hippie circle I was familiar with.  Again, &quot;fringe&quot; is accurate.  

:The vast majority of hippies opposed the war in Vietnam out of CONCERN for the welfare of military personnel, who were in fact their friends, brothers and cousins.  I can understand that you might believe such concern was counterproductive (the first paragraph of the &quot;Politics&quot; section mentions this), but peaceful protest against the Vietnam War was far from &quot;dishonorable, unpatriotic and treasonous.&quot;   The right to free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is what all Americans have fought for from the beginning of our Republic, and it is precisely &quot;speech that offends someone&quot; (in this case speech protesting the War in Vietnam, which military personnel found offensive) that needs such constitutional protection.  Speech that offends no one needs no such protection, and non-offensive speech is not curtailed even in autocratic states (the People's Republic of China, the former Soviet Union, Saddam's Iraq, Afghanistan under the Taliban) that do not guarantee freedom of speech. 

:I would agree with you, however, that Jane Fonda's trip to North Vietnam and her various pronouncments WERE &quot;dishonorable, unpatriotic and treasonous.&quot; Jane Fonda never considered herself a &quot;hippie,&quot; and because she never demonstrated any understanding of what we stood for, neither did we claim her. Fonda's actions went far beyond the intent and scope of those of us who peacefully protested the Vietnam War, and every hippie I know condemned her at the time. 

:Your father may never have heard of Scott McKenzie's rendition of the song &quot;San Francisco,&quot; but that does not make the information provided erroneous.  Again, please consult the record, Scott McKenzie's web page in particular.  &quot;San Francisco&quot; became the pre-eminent &quot;freedom song&quot; throughout Eastern Europe in their bid to free themselves from Soviet oppression after the song was taken back to Europe after the 1967 &quot;Summer of Love,&quot; where it rose to #1 in the charts. The Soviet Union eventually forbade the playing of &quot;San Francisco&quot; because it became a rallying cry for &quot;Prague Spring,&quot; Czechoslovakia's premature 1968 attempt to cast off the Soviet yoke.

:The song you cited was deleted only because it did not make any reference to hippies, the subject of the article.  I have corrected this, and it is now part of the article.  Its inclusion would be also very appropriate in the article discussing the Vietnam War and the lack of appreciation felt by returning vets.  On a personal note, I must say that I regret this lack of appreciation, and I extend my heartfelt thanks to your father, and to you, for the service you have provided our nation.  Although I did not serve in the military, three of my cousins served in Vietnam, and I have personally thanked them as well.

:Interesting that you would say that you &quot;HATE HIPPIES.&quot;  How many hippies have you really known?  What do you think we stood for?  As a former hippie, I acknowledge that hippies were mistaken about a lot of things.  But one thing we got right was our emphasis on Christian love, which precludes hating anyone.  To you I can only say &quot;Peace Brother.&quot; We are both patriotic, freedom loving Americans. Semper fidelis indeed![[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 23:40, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

Well I appreciate your nice little note, especially its depth and concern. It's nice to know that at least someone on this &quot;encyclopedia&quot; addresses the tough questions, unlike your friends over at the bin Laden page. I also sincerely appreciate, and will go so far as to applaud your addition of the Llyod Marcus song. I think that is a nice gesture of fairness and impartiality that I feel tends to be lacking on Wikipedia.  I also am glad you did not just delete my questions and disregard them as &quot;vandalism&quot; as most people would've done. 

Nevertheless, I still feel like the hippies disrespected our military, and they helped in the defeat of the United States of America, for which I attribute the characteristic of being unpatriotic. 

Of course, it is your right under the 1st Amendment to freedom of speech, but I still believe that it was irresponsible and inappropriate to go to the lengths that hippies often went to. It is undeniable, that hippies would participate in burning the flag of the United States, the burning of ROTC buildings, the stoning of soldiers, and for this I hold my animosity towards hippies. 

As a soon-to-be Marine, the extreme anger that I get anytime I see someone burning our flag leaves me unable to respect any group of people who would do this EVER as a form of protesting. 

Again, thank you for your returning my message, but I find myself unable to forgive these actions. Semper fi.

*Please find me a single reference to '''hippies''' burning ROTC buildings (for example). You are conflating &quot;hippies&quot; with the much much broader counterculture, anti-war, free speech etc. movements. You have every right to be pissed off at them (though I think your anger is misplaced), but mostly those people weren't hippies. The SDS wasn't hippies. The Free Speech Movement wasn't hippies. The kids murdered at Kent State weren't hippies. Yes, hippies were anti-war, but they weren't anywhere near the bulk of the anti-war crowd. There simply weren't a lot of hippies -- but there were tons of anti-Vietnam-war people. --[[User:Jpgordon|jpgordon]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Jpgordon|&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 02:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for your thoughts.  I would like you to know that I never burned an American flag, and I am offended when I see that done.  

:Flag burning is an interesting topic though.  When an American flag becomes too tattered, the officially prescribed method of disposal is to burn that flag.  Yet some people propose a constitutional amendment to make that same action, burning the flag, illegal if it is done in protest.  In other words, the proposed constitutional amendment would make certain THOUGHTS illegal, which sounds quite un-American to me!  

:The debate as to why America lost the Vietnam War will probably continue forever.  Personally, I believe we lost the war because a large percentage of the Vietnamese people (Dwight Eisenhower, who first committed American military advisers to Vietnam, put the percentage at 85%) favored Ho Chi Minh over South Vietnamese leaders (Diem, then a succession of military rulers) favored by the U.S.  This was certainly a bad choice, and communism brought the Vietnamese people much misery, but it was THEIR choice.

:The 15% of Vietnamese who favored U.S. involvement were the more educated, urban Vietnamese who appreciated the benefits of a free market, democratic system and who were less vulnerable to communist propoganda.  It was this educated minority of Vietnamese whom we supported, and who supported us, and I believe our objective in Vietnam was an honorable one.  I worked on an alternate plan, &quot;The Free Cities Plan,&quot; which was lobbied in Congress but never received sufficient favor for implementation--this would have established Free Zones, similar to Hong Kong or West Berlin, which the U.S. could have easily defended.  This option would have avoided the general militarizaiton of the war.
:: &quot;[http://www.jonread.net/2006/08/the_free_cities_plan.html The Free Cities Plan]&quot; can be found here. FYI the author Jon Read is not Founders4.

:I opposed our choice to generally militarize the war because I believe it is impossible to win a war when only 15% of the people involved want you to win it.  While the U.S. enjoyed majority support in the larger cities of South Vietnam, in the countryside support fell off rapidly; since Vietnam was largely rural, we could not hold a countryside where support for the Viet Cong approached 100%.

:Despite news reports to the contrary, and due to the valor of those U.S. soldiers who fought in Vietnam (along with Australians and soldiers of other nationalities), we DID prevail militarily in nearly every battle.  But winning  the war was another story, and by choosing to generally militarize the war, I believe we overreached.

:America lost 58,191 good soldiers during our nearly 20 years of various sorts of engagement (1957-1975).  During this period we killed between 1,000,000 and 3,000,000 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians--perhaps 10% of the population.

:We needed to leave Vietnam not because we lost the war militarily, but because to continue fighting was pointless.  A majority of the Vietnamese wanted to implement communism, and they could not be dissuaded by our commitment to freedom.  This was a tragedy for all concerned, especially after 1975 when several million Vietnamese were murdered by their own government.

:By the way, in case you are wondering, I DO support our current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I admire your choice to join the Marines.  I believe our war against Islamofascism in these two countries is not at all like Vietnam. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

::Wow, I'm proud of you Founders. Maybe not ALL hippies are bad. I am very surprised that a former hippie would support the Iraq war, and I agree with you on your entire last paragraph. You raise some good points about Vietnam that lead me  to believe that you aren't as far left as some of the neo-hippies today on college campuses, with whom I have had many encounters. 

::Although we will probably never be able to agree on every issue with the Vietnam War, my respect for you has gone up a good deal throughout this dialogue. I am also surprised by your willingness to acknowledge the unfair, biased reporting.

:Thanks!  I appreciate your kind words.  What you might want to do, at least in your own thinking, is differentiate between us REAL hippies (we started as a group composed of perhaps 500 people beginning in 1965) and the pretenders.   Real hippies were thoughtful, fun-loving folk--sincere, loving and quite sane--as they continue to be.  In fact the prime movers have been extremely productive during the years since--even the popularization of the Internet and the operating systems that allow us ordinary folks to use computers were inspired by hippie culture.  

:Probably your image of hippies has been tarnished by all those ragged, unwashed, unproductive homeless people who now populate our urban centers.  Please believe me when I tell you that it wasn't like that at all!

== Pejorative connotations ==

Perhaps you misunderstand what Wikipedia is.  It is a place where one may add to the information available about a certain topic.  It is not the  place to offer criticism, or praise, for a certain group.

Obviously you consider former hippies to be self-important, self-centered nostalgia freaks.  You may be correct in this assessment, but that is beside the point.  The word &quot;hippie&quot; does not have this pejorative connotation, which is what this section is about.

Please refrain from personal ruminations. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 17:11, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

Doesn't the name Hippy come from Hipsters, a type of jeans fasionable at the time?--[[User:2toise|2toise]] 10:56, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:It does sort of come from Hipster, but the jeans came after, not before. I think the best orthographic description of the origins of the word would go approximately:
(1953) &quot;Hep cat&quot;-- (1957) &quot;Hep&quot;-- (1961) &quot;Hip&quot;-- (1963) &quot;Hipster&quot;-- (1967) &quot;Hippie&quot;. You could continue with &quot;Yippie&quot; and &quot;Zippie&quot; and &quot;Yuppie&quot; and &quot;Buppie&quot; if you wanted to recount every tiresome transmogrification of the term.--[[User:Doovinator|Doovinator]] 03:13, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I have to do a lot of reading to find it again, but I recall back in the 80's reading a 1950's Steinbeck novel and being quite surprised that he used the word &quot;hippie&quot; or &quot;hippy&quot; -- just once, and quite casually, as if the reader would know what it meant.

Yablonsky comments extensively on this in ''The Hippie Trip'' (pp 36-37), published in 1968.  Yablonsky admitted that estimates of hippie numbers were a speculative sport, but these are his estimates based on extensive personal research, including some collecting of empirical evidence in the form of thousands of questionaires he had hippies fill out:
:-200,000 core, visible and identifiable total hippie drop-outs in the United States.
:-Another 200,000 visible teeny-bopper, part-time summer and weekend hippies.
:-Millions of hippie &quot;fellow travelers&quot; who had enormous sympathy with the core drop-out and their philosophy and who aided them in various ways. (Yablonsky includes parents also as involuntary participants who were generally unsympathetic to the hippie movement.)

Yablonsky's conclusion:  Several million Americans were directly involved.  Probably a more informed guess than most. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 05:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

== 1964 Demonstration Against the Vietnam War? ==

&quot;The first use of the word hippie on US television was on WNBC TV Channel 4 in New York City at the opening of the New York World's Fair on April 22, 1964. Some young Anti-Vietnam War protesters, wearing t-shirts, denim jeans and with long hair like The Beatles, staged a sit-in and were called Hippies by NYPD officers and reporters.&quot;

Although the Vietnam War officialy dates from 1957, and the U.S. did have advisers in Vietnam (including a few who were involved in combat), the Vietnam War really didn't get serious until the Tonkin Gulf Incident in August, 1964 and Johnson's subsequent decision to escalate our involvement.  Don't remember ANY demonstrations against the Vietnam War prior to that.  Is this April 22, 1964 date really accurate?[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
:Good question, as we still need a citation for this in the article.   It is likely that sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] influenced the early antiwar movement, with his critique of the [[military industrial complex]].  [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] was organized at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1962, and their [[Port Huron Statement]] criticized the polices of war in general, mentioning Vietnam once.  [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1963 protest song, &quot;[[Masters of War]]&quot;, is generally considered or was used as a protest against Vietnam; during the late spring of [[1963]] Buddhists in Vietnam began protesting American-supported government repression by [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], and by this time, the U.S. was being condemned around the world by governments and protest groups alike for supporting the South Vietnamese brutality and suppression of human rights. Diem was overthrown on Nov. 1, and [[JFK|Kennedy]] was [[assassinated]] three weeks later.  Johnson escalated the war, and the [[Free Speech Movement]] began at [[University of California, Berkeley|UCB]] in the fall of [[1964]]; the antiwar movement flowered in the spring of [[1965]] after Johnson bombed North Vietnam, with New Left and antiwar activists using the campus as a platform, later bringing the movement to the streets. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 01:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

==Old lead==
'''Hippie''', often spelled '''hippy''', is a term commonly used to describe some of the rebellious youth of the [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]].  The word ''hippie'' was popularized by the late [[San Francisco Chronicle]] columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose articles were written with the help of notes and letters from his San Francisco fan base. He is also credited as among the first to include the words ''[[beatnik]]'' and [[yuppie]] in his column. 

Though not a cohesive [[cultural movement]] with well-defined leaders and manifestos, some generalizations nonetheless apply.  Hippies tended to express their desire for change by renouncing corporate influence, consumerism and the Vietnam War; by embracing aspects of [[Judeo-Christian|non-Judeo-Christian]] [[religion|religious]] cultures (including much Eastern philosophy); by adopting nomadic lifestyles; and by criticizing Western [[middle class]] values. Elements of [[romanticism]] and [[Transcendentalist]] philosophy can be seen in their writings and artistic expressions. They also embraced [[communal living]], [[recreational drug use]], [[Free Love|free love]], [[sexual liberation]], [[interracial dating]], unconventional clothing, long hair for both genders and facial hair for men.

Most hippies believed that the government was corrupt, corporate industry was souless and greedy, traditional morals were askew, and war was inhumane. Hippies often referred to the structures and institutions they opposed as [[The Establishment]] or [[The Man]].  

The [[21st century]] has brought with it a [[Hippie#Neo-Hippies|neo-hippie]] movement, with an ethos similar to that of the original hippies. 

== Rewrite ==

You added &quot;though not a cohesive [[cultural movement]] with well-defined leaders and manifestos&quot;, back into [[Hippie]] after I removed it. In fact, there ''were'' well-defined leaders and manifestos, so I'm not understanding this statement.  However, this was not a cultural movement, but a countercultural movement that spread around the world. This statement is supported by various sources, including [[Britannica]].  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 21:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:I didn't write the original sentence, but I do believe it conveys an important reality about what the hippie counterculture movement was all about.  When you objected to the starkness of the original sentence, I added the qualifier &quot;well-defined&quot; to differentiate between movements that have strong centers and this one, which did not.

:The problem with writing about what happened during the hippie era is that the &quot;leaders&quot;--Ken Kesey, Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsburg, Timothy Leary, Owsley Stanley, Steve Gaskin, Stewart Brand and hundreds of others whom I personally knew--did not consider themselves to be leaders at all.  It was much more playful than that. They said things, but they did not expect what they said to be taken too seriously.  They wrote various things, but these certainly were not &quot;manifestos.&quot;  Many of the most influential &quot;leaders&quot; were song writers and musicians--hippiedom evolved, much as a musical piece evolves during a jam session.

:I've read your current introduction.  I really think the previous one, which had stood for a long time, was better.  You are correct that it was a &quot;counterculture movement,&quot; and that is a good change to make.  But some of the rest is inaccurate:

:*It didn't just surface on United States college campuses--the base was much broader than that.  The Wikipedia &quot;Counterculture&quot; article does a good job explaining this.

:*When you say it spread to other Western democracies, citing Canada and Britain in particular, this is much too limiting a statement.

:*Hippies did indeed embrace the term &quot;hippie.&quot;  It was widely used among those who were actual participants, and its use was not limited to outsiders who intended it pejoratively. But, again, no one who was actually involved took it that seriously.

:I also think the previous organization was better--a brief introduction to the word &quot;hippie&quot; and who popularized it, rather than spotlighting the first, rather obscure references to the word.

:In particular I object to new paragraph that begins &quot;Hippies were said to have rejected the mores of conventional society.&quot;  The rest of the paragraph does not follow from the lead sentence.  

:And you have eliminated entirely: &quot;Most hippies believed that the government was corrupt, corporate industry was souless and greedy, traditional morals were askew, and war was inhumane. Hippies often referred to the structures and institutions they opposed as The Establishment or The Man.&quot;  I think this conveyed quite a lot.

::I appreciate your essay-length reply, but it makes it difficult to reply to your points in context.  I'll try, in any case:

::*'''Hippies as a cultural movement'''.  I thought this point was resolved by replacing it with the countercultural movement, but you say you want to emphasize the lack of a &quot;strong center&quot;.  If you have a source, cite it.  Better yet, explain what you mean.  As far as I understand it, by its very nature, the hippie movement was decentralized.

::*'''Leaders'''. Yes, you make good points, and I think something more should be said about the previous point.  However, there were leaders, strong or weak, and there were defining texts.  

::*'''Rewrite of the lead'''.  What you call inaccurate is either text that was already in the article, or information that can be easily cited:

::*'''College campuses'''.  You're absolutely right, but the campus was the epicenter.  The lead needs to be tight and to the point, and if you can do that with a minor change, by all means go ahead, but I don't see a problem with it as it stands in reference to this point.

::*'''Sphere of influence'''.  It spread around the world, but the immediate effects were felt in Canada and the UK for obvious reasons. This can be expanded in the rest of the article. 

::*'''Hippie as a pejorative'''.  At what point did &quot;hippies&quot; embrace the term?  As I understand it the term was derogatory, and actual &quot;hippies&quot; referred to themselves by other names, such as &quot;freaks&quot;.

::*'''Previous lead'''.  You think that talking about Herb Caen for half the lead was better?  Take a look at [[WP:LEAD]].  

::*'''Rejection of mores'''.  You object to the standard, cited definition of Hippies?  The rest of the lead, in fact, does follow from that statement, so I'm not following you.  Can you be specific?

::*'''Establishment and The Man'''.  No, I did not eliminate this section.  You'll find that I moved it to the politics section, intact. I think it conveys a lot too, but does it belong in the lead?  I think not. 

::*'''Aggressive'''.  See [[WP:OWN]].  I'm willing to compromise.  You'll see that I did not revert jpgordon's removal of my addition of baby boomers to the lead, even though I feel that is an accurate statement. 

::This article needs a lot of work and there's a lot that needs to be done.  I agree that the lead should be changed, but it must reflect the rest of the article, which at this point is a complete mess.  We disagree on the use of the word as a pejorative.  The pejorative connotations section claims this is a recent development, but it's always been that way, from day one. I have no doubt that hippies have embraced the term as their own, like many subcultures.  And, the characteristics section needs to be merged back into the rest of the article and expanded.  As it stands, it's just a list of stereotypes. There's a timeline waiting to be split; Historical antecedents should be moved to the top section; etymology needs to be separated from origins; and the legacy section should be greatly expanded. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 10:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

:Your point by point approach reminds me of the linear approach my lawyer friends take.  Unfortnately such an approach is antithetical to the hippie spirit.

:It's not that the leaders were &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak.&quot;  They just were not &quot;well defined.&quot;  The leaders, some of whom I named, did not always lead.  Often the followers led.   My metaphor of a jam band--do you play music, or have you witnessed a jam session?--is apropos.  It was a creative process, and no one--not the &quot;leaders&quot; and not the &quot;followers&quot;--knew where it would take us.

:You stated that there were defining texts.  Which texts might you be referring to?  To the best of my knowledge, there really were not any &quot;defining texts&quot; of the hippie movement.  A number of published works exerted significant influence, but they were not written by hippies and they embodied no concerted attempt to inspire change.  STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Robert Heinlein was a good example.  Others would be THE PROPHET by Kahlil Gibran, THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER by Eklal Kueshana, THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD and many lessor tracts by Leary, Kesey and others that appeared and disappeared in short order.  Some of the most influential people--Neal Cassady for example--wrote little that was published during his lifetime.  I spent only about a month with Neal, but that exposure changed everything.  Steve Gaskin probably wrote more, but his main influence was during his &quot;Monday Night Classes&quot; when he would emanate such a strong aura that EVERYONE in the room could see it.  Last New Year's Eve I took my daughter and her boyfriend to hear Phil Lesh and Friends--in the absence of the Grateful Dead this was the closest I could come to introducing them to the kind of learning that occurred during the hippie era.  The movement, and the learning associated with it, was mostly not intellectual--not a &quot;mind trip&quot; as we would have said back then. And specific songs exerted enormous influence; we all know them, so I won't name them here.

:The campuses were perhaps the epicenters with respect to specific happenings.  For example I was at Berkeley during the Free Speech Movement.  And I helped build People's Park, which was an endeavor connected with the Berkeley campus.  But most of the rest of it, in fact a lot of the most important stuff, occurred elsewhere and had nothing whatever to do with college campuses.

:To mention Canada and the UK without mentioning the rest of Western (and even Eastern) Europe is a problem for me.  Also, the lead as you have witten it is much too America-centric--previous editors have worked hard to eliminate this tendency.  For example, when the Beatles visited San Francisco and were turned on to psychedelics this vastly changed their music, but then that music returned to change the evolving U.S. hippie scene.  The period between 1964 and 1969 was intense and free-flowing--it's just not accurate to say it was a &quot;countercultural movement which surfaced on United States college campuses in the 1960s, spreading to other Western democracies such as Canada and Britain&quot;--it was much broader than that and much more interactive.

:We embraced the term as soon as other people started referring to us as &quot;hippies.&quot;  I don't remember exactly when I first heard the term, but certainly by early 1967 we called ourselves &quot;hippies,&quot; welcoming the term and accepting it warmly.  It just wasn't a serious thing.  &quot;Freaks&quot; was also used, but not that often...and it applied mostly to drug-addled hippies.

:You are right about the section mentioning Herb Caen.  I suppose we don't really need to mention that he also popularized &quot;beatniks&quot; and &quot;yuppies,&quot; although this does point up how influential he was with respect to the &quot;hippie&quot; label.

:&quot;Hippies were said to have rejected the mores of conventional society.&quot;  My first objection to this sentence is the use of the passive &quot;were said,&quot; which begs the question &quot;by whom.&quot;  I suppose &quot;mores&quot; does encompass most of the rest of the paragraph, but it has strong connotations of moral values.  In my opinion, what the article needs to convey is that the hippie impulse for change was generalized and experimental.  A lot of things were tried and rejected.  Some of it stuck, which is the hippie legacy.

:Regarding &quot;standard, cited definitions of hippies&quot;--well I think we can do better referencing sources other than the Britannica.

:&quot;Establishment and The Man.&quot;  Yes, of course you are correct.  There were many edits, which I scanned rather quickly, and I missed the new location.

:Yes, your approach did seem aggressive to me.  This article, as much as you may disdain it, has a rather long history.  And it has improved over time--just look at some of the earlier edits if you don't believe me.  I think it is better to proceed in an evolutionary way, as this maximizes the gain.  Everyone, even previous editors, had a lot to offer in what they wrote.  And you have something to offer as well.  I would just appreciate it if the changes were less wholesale.

:Hold the presses!  I just went to the current article, and I see that you ARE willing to compromise.  Maybe this will be the beginning of a successful collaborative effort.  Thanks for melding some of the old lead back in.  Perhaps I'll make a few changes that I think might be appropriate given our conversation.

:Regarding the article needing a lot of work:  I went ahead and read the Britannica article, which you referenced previously.  I believe the Wikipedia article, for all its faults, better communicates what hippies were all about.  Part of the reason for this is that the Wikipedia article doesn't try to &quot;nail it.&quot;  It can't be &quot;nailed.&quot;  I suspect that the changes you propose would bring the Wikipedia article more in line with the Britannica article; I think that would be a mistake.

:The pejorative issue is an important one.  You say &quot;it's always been that way from day one.&quot;  Well, as I have mentioned, I knew most of the primary people, and I was &quot;on scene&quot; from 1964 on.  I can tell you that you are mistaken on this one. We accepted the label &quot;from day one,&quot; and it was accepted in good humor.

:I believe the characteristics section would be difficult to merge into the article, though I do understand your objections.  Probably the most important part of this section is the last part, quoting Stewart Brand and alluding to the spiritual and philosophical underpinnings of the hippie ethos.

:If you move the historical antecedents to the top section, I think readers might get too bogged down.  I understand your reason for wanting to do so, and I considered it myself, but on balance I think it should stay where it is.

:Made a couple of changes to the lead in keeping with comments above.  Probably it's good enough as is, though I would still like to see some reference to the interactive aspect, especially with respect to the British and American music scenes.  Not sure how to succinctly express it though.  Also couldn't immediately come up with a concise description of how the hippie movement evolved after its campus origins.  Substituted &quot;intentional community&quot; for &quot;communal living&quot; to eliminate disturbing (though only apparent) redundancy with &quot;simple living;&quot;  that's where the link leads anyhow.

:Your reorganization of the history section looks pretty good, though I think it might need some cleanup here and there.  As mentioned above, I had considered doing something like this also.

*It would be a good idea to distance yourself from your personal recollections. I know my own personal recollections are somewhat fuzzy seeing as how it was 40 years ago, and I was young and enjoying myself. But even if I remembered quite clearly, it would still be OR. For example, I sure remember the pejorative use of &quot;hippie&quot; being applied to me as early as 1967 (usually in the form &quot;get a haircut, hippie&quot; or &quot;get a job, hippie&quot; or just &quot;fucking hippie&quot;, even though at that point I wasn't a fucking hippie, I was a fucking mod; the people using the pejorative didn't have much subtlety or sense of nuance.) I agree that there weren't defining texts or manifestos, though I suppose an argument could be made that commonly enjoyed texts (it was a very literate movement!) were &quot;defining&quot;; we could find someone making that argument, perhaps. And, Founders4 -- big long essays on talk pages rarely get read or paid proper attention to. It's just how things are on the net. Always better to encapsulate. --[[User:Jpgordon|jpgordon]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Jpgordon|&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Jpgordon.  Points well taken, especially the OR thing.  Nevertheless, if one reads (or participates in editing) a Wikipedia article and finds it at variance with what one knows to be true, the search is on to find legitimate sources that will allow proper corrections.  Yeah, I was called a &quot;fuckin' hippie&quot; too (usually by older women, who accurately perceived our behavior to be obnoxious)--accepting the label with humor and mild pride seemed the best &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; response. I suppose a section should be added on writings that influenced the movement. How'd I do on encapsulation? [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 19:51, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Moving ahead ==

Much appreciation for the cleanup work happening here. 

Hey Founders4 -- do you think &quot;conservative&quot; is sufficiently broad in the &quot;Pejorative&quot; section? Remember, there was then a substantial straightlaced element among liberals also that had a lot of disrespect for &quot;hippies&quot;, and used the the term disparagingly. Maybe they were just my parents' friends, I dunno; certainly conservatives were nastier and more monolithic about it, but the same liberals who were shocked and bothered by the Filthy Speech Movement were shocked and bothered by the hairy unwashed masses. --[[User:Jpgordon|jpgordon]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Jpgordon|&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;&amp;#8711;&amp;#8710;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

You're right.  One friend, well-known anti-war activist Jon Read, was hardly a &quot;conservative,&quot; yet he referred to the Haight-Ashbury, even in its heyday, as &quot;teenage skid row.&quot;  I remember once referring to my live-in girlfriend as my &quot;old lady&quot; (she was 25) to his extreme amusement.  He thought hippies made &quot;responsible progressives&quot; look bad.  I'll try something--see what you think. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 22:23, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Too much, too fast ==

:::Hippies did not create a cohesive political or social movement with well-defined leaders and manifestos. Rather the hippie ethos evolved as a social manifestation of 1960s zeitgeist in an interactive play between leaders and followers. Many people who embraced the hippie lifestyle believed that the government was corrupt, that corporate industry was souless and greedy, that traditional morals were askew, and that war was inhumane. Elements of Romanticism and Transcendentalist philosophy can be seen in their writings and artistic expressions. Hippies often referred to the structures and institutions they opposed as The Establishment or The Man.

:::Hippies did not create a cohesive political or social movement with well-defined leaders and manifestos. Rather the hippie ethos evolved as a social manifestation of 1960s zeitgeist in an interactive play between leaders and followers. Many of the original hippies shared a firmly held belief that peace and love were far more desirable than war and hatred. They believed that corrupt government and corporate industrial greed had combined to form a souless and inhumane military-industrial complex, and that traditional morals had gone askew. Hippies often referred to the structures and institutions they opposed as The Establishment or The Man.

Hi Pedant.  I've copied the old and new versions of the paragraph in question so it will be easier to compare them. In the new paragraph you have focused on government corruption and corporate industrial greed, bringing in statements regarding the military industrial complex, all of which is a reflection of your opinion that the hippie movement was primarily an antiwar movement.    Also, you write that hippies believed &quot;that peace and love were far more desirable than war and hatred,&quot; which is almost preaching.

There are a few problems I see with this revision.  The first problem is that this is the lead-in to a longer article, and it must be concise.  It is describing, in very general terms, the hippie outlook, which was actually quite broad.  True, Vietnam was a catalyst, but many hippies objected to traditional morals with respect to sexual matters, business and a variety of other matters; the focus of the paragraph cannot be only war. The second problem is the preachy thing--EVERYONE believes that &quot;peace and love (are) more desirable than war and hatred.&quot;  Even those who favored our involvement in Vietnam believed that our involvement would lead to a more just peace and  save many lives that might otherwise be lost in the event of a communist takeover (which DID happen, by the way--about 4 million murdered by the North Vietnamese communist government after 1975).   Most hippies disagreed with this viewpoint, but it was far more complex than a &quot;good hippie vs. bad military/industrial complex&quot; thing. Also, you have eliminated the sentence that speaks of Romanticism and Trancendentalist philosophy and moved it to the next paragraph; this doesn't work very well, because the  paragraph we are discussing is a general introduction to hippie philosophical perspectives, while the next paragraph introduces how those perspectives manifested in hippie life.

Here's what I would suggest:  You want to write about the anti-war aspect as an important expression of hippie beliefs.  This would be an expansion of the &quot;war is inhumane&quot; clause in the paragraph we are discussing. Perhaps you might write a paragraph or two discussing only this and create a section similar to the &quot;Sexual attitudes&quot; and &quot;Travel&quot; sections.  I think that such a discussion probably belongs in, let's say, an &quot;Anti-war activities&quot; section. I do think, though, that when you use words like &quot;especially,&quot; &quot;firmly held,&quot; or &quot;souless,&quot; you invite objections.  If you write something that simply conveys the reality back then, rather than your own passions (then and now), I believe it will be better received.  I'd be happy to aid you in this effort, if you wish.

Meanwhile, I do feel the original paragraph was more appropriate. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 04:49, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

              

Wow, you've been busy!  Can we take it slower please?  Some of the many organizational changes work, but others really don't.  

Your addition of headings within the lead effectively eliminates it, for example.  Felt I needed to take them out.

And the very personal picture of Pat Dailey dominates.  Granted the other picture is also contemporary, but it's not personal, it's more to scale and it offers a more generic impression of period hippie dress.  A better picture would be from the '65-71 period showing the same sort of thing, if you can find one.  Meanwhile I put the other one back since it's been in there for a long time.  Hope you find a better one.

The article is mainly about the original hippies, with neo-hippies as an endnote--the article shouldn't lead with an entire section about them.  Moved it to near the end.

The headings you added to the &quot;Legacy&quot; section seem a bit much given the content--probably neither necessary nor desirable unless you intend to expand the section (more festivals, for example).  Left them in for now and tried to correct the text to make things flow.

There's no rush, how about incremental changes?!

[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 05:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

===Inaccurate assessment===
NO.  I do not &quot;want to write about the anti-war aspect as an important expression of hippie beliefs&quot; I ''wrote about'' the beliefs themselves, the beliefs created the hippies, not the other way around.  It was the shared beliefs that brought people together in the streets, and only then did they become labeled by the industrial/corporate press as hippies.  Opposition to the war was the number one core belief shared by those ''that later began to be labelled as'' hippies.

:I really don't feel that the pic is captioned well 1) it is from a Russian Rainbow gathering, and 2) it's not particularly 'stereotypical hippie clothes' ... it seems more of a costume to me.  The Pat Dailey pic I like, because he actually ''is'' a notable older hippie, (LA Times article quotes him as saying that those are his 'ordinary clothes') pic is from the USA (where hippies originated) and shows him at a museum (where his [[Art car]] is on display, not at some place where one might 'dress up as' a hippie -- contrasted to a very young russian in costume at a rainbow gathering in russia.  I think the hippie guitar pic is more suitable for the rainbow gathering section, since it's a picture from a rainbow gathering.

As for the 'government is corrupt' section... it is a historical ''fact'' that the government of that time was corrupt, this article is about hippies, hippies did not 'feel the government was corrupt, and that corporate industry was souless and greedy'... corporations are ''by definition'' soulless, and it is not industry per se but greed which causes industrial interests to fund and supply both sides to war... and hippies originated in the time shortly after Eisenhauer warned the nation about the military industrial complex (farewell speech 1961) so it was a fresh concept and  widely discussed... and hippies were ''a phenomenon of'' the wider antiwar movement, and yes, maybe &quot;everyone believes in ' peace and love but these were ''fundamental'' to the hippie ethos... far more than putting a guitar strap on one's head as a headband, growing long hair (many, perhaps a majority of the earliest hippies '''did not have long hair''') and 'dressing like a hippie' at a rainbow festival nearly half a century later.  I really think this sentence, more than any other change I made to the article is a masterpiece of summation of hippie thought:

''&quot;They believed that corrupt government and corporate industrial greed had combined to form a souless and inhumane military-industrial complex, and that traditional morals had gone askew.&quot;''

&quot;They thought war was inumane&quot; ... everybody thinks that, as you might put it.  And it wasn't that traditional morals ''were'' askew, rather, that they had recently ''become'' askew.  As you aptly state 'everyone believes in peace and love', that IS a traditional moral belief.  

I think my sentence shows a 'reaction by people to the current history' of the era, which actually created or caused people to become hippies... rather than 'suddenly the hippies arose and believed this or that' and wore long hair and played guitars. (stereotypes of hippies were created without regard to the reality of hippies and soon 'became' the reality -- showing the power of the corporate press to co-opt what was essentially, literally the essence of the hippie, the antiwar part.)  

The beliefs in response to the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the dawn of the supercorporation, the recognition that corporate industry and the military combined with the corrupt government had created a '''new thing''', the military industrial complex, which Ike had warned us about at the very dawn of the 60's... this makes the article more descriptive of the beliefs that actually ''spawned the hippies''  rather than vague watered-down expressions of 'what hippies believe', and basing it on '''media representations of hippies'''  ''&quot;Many people who embraced the hippie lifestyle&quot;'' presupposes a lifestyle, implies people joining the hippie movement -- ''Many of the original hippies shared a firmly held belief&quot;'' shows more clearly that we are talking about the causative, formative influences that created the hippies.  

&quot;Hippie lifestyle&quot; is something that arose subsequent to the binding force of shared belief.

Also I think ''&quot;Another proposed source of the word &quot;hippie&quot; is the Wolof language of Africa where hipi or hepi means to open one's eyes and be aware.&quot;'' has gotta go, as it's plainly historical revisionism, like saying that &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; 'may have come from a theatrical expression of 'one who sees the show for free' from the practice of giving away tickets to fill seats in the theater'. Clearly &quot;hippie&quot; did not originate in the relatively obscure-at-the-time Wolof language.  More helpful would be a citation of the first time hippie appeared in print, and a quote from that source.

And I don't think 'neo-hippies needs so much detail in this article, I merged all the neohippie material preparatory to breaking it out to a main article of its own.  As for the 'small sections' problem, small sections can help organise  the material and encourage contributions on the sections when editors notice the paucity of material on the relevant subtopic.  Not to be argumentative, I really don't think we need an edit war over this article, but I think my edit was pretty worthwhile or I wouldn't have made it.  If you don't like my contrib, edit it away as you have done.  Eventually the article will be better.  I'll work on something else for a while. '''Comments?''' [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 15:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Pedant.  Not much time this A.M.  Will comment ASAP.

:Hi again, Pedant.   Edit war--heavens no!  If we can't accomodate one another and remain at peace over something ephemeral like a Wikipedia article, then what good is the &quot;peace-love&quot; ethos anyway?

:I do understand your perspective.  Not sure where to begin, as you raise so many points.  It's true we disagree, but let's work on some stuff.  Easy ones first:

:Several African languages were spoken by African Americans who were brought to America as slaves.  Quite a few words from these languages made their way into English.  And a lot of Black slang had its origins in the Wolof language.  Black slang made its way into the 20th century jazz scene, then to the Beatnik scene, then to the Hippie scene.  So we go &quot;hep&quot; or &quot;hipi&quot; in Wolof, to &quot;hep&quot; from the Jazz scene, to &quot;hip&quot; from the Beatnik era, to &quot;Hippie.&quot; Not so far fetched, really, though more work needs to be done on this.   The Wolof information was contributed about a month ago and it has been edited down since then.  The much more obscure Greek term, &quot;hippei,&quot; got edited out by J.P. Gordon yesterday--appropriately I think.  (BTW, the first time &quot;hippie&quot; appears in print is mentioned in the &quot;History: 1963-66&quot; section.)

:Regarding the photo, I agree completely that it is lacking and appears as costume, though the Russian guy looks pretty much like a lot of people from the actual '60's hippie scene.  To me the one you posted seemed less appropriate.  Not period.  Clothes difficult to make out.  Androgynous person.  Personal.  Lots of modern, flashing stuff.  Just my opinion, of course.  I think we need to find a real period photo since the article is centered on the 1960's, perhaps one showing men and women together, --I'll try to find one, and maybe your can too, and we can agree on something.  Then putting the existing one in the &quot;Rainbow&quot; section is great.

:A &quot;Neo-Hippie&quot; article of its own sounds like a good idea.  Can provide a link from the &quot;Hippie&quot; article.

:The small sections seem a bit much to me, though I understand your point about encouraging contributions.  Not a problem, in any case, which is why I left them.  I try to make a point of not simply reverting stuff (except vandalism) and do my best to explain when I change something, especially if the change is extensive. 

:O.K., now the tough stuff.  You believe that anti-Vietnam War sentiment was THE binding force behind the hippie movement.  My suggestion was an attempt to arrive at a compromise where you could expand on this theme.  Personally I think the evidence is very strong that there were several binding forces behind the hippie movement, among them:  the sexual revolution, reaction against the conformity of the 1950's, a desire to explore new spiritual frontiers, rejection of the predominantly materialist interpretation of the American Dream that prevailed at the time (and still does), a desire for a rapprochment among different racial groups (springing from the Civil Rights movement), a rejection of &quot;straight&quot; cultural norms coupled with a love of personalized craftsmanship (a true Arts and Crafts revival), and a hunger for adventure and novelty (in music, in clothing, in artistic expression, and so on) that typifies the youth of every generation.  And, yes, I think Vietnam was an important part of it.

:Perhaps my experiences don't typify those of most who &quot;embraced the hippie lifestyle.&quot;  But I knew a lot of people who were there at the beginning, and I am sure that opposition to the Vietnam War was not central to their thinking and behavior:  Here's a summary:

::Attended Berkeley beginning in 1964 and participated in the Free Speech Movement, which was directly connected to the Civil Rights Movement in the American South.  We weren't yet &quot;hippies,&quot; but we had begun to set in motion the beginnings of a &quot;counterculture,&quot; and our political awareness was rising. Vietnam didn't yet figure in.

::Summer, '65.  Spent quite a bit of time at Ken Kesey's place in La Honda with Kesey, Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, the Hell's Angels, many Pranksters and lots of &quot;hip&quot; Berkeley folk.  &quot;Further,&quot; the famous psychedelic bus, was there, as Kesey had just returned from his famous jaunt to the East Coast.  Most people were stoned on acid, or speed, or other drugs.  It was a lot of fun, there was live music, Neal was tripping and rapping and storytelling, and it was great.  The &quot;acid test-party-music&quot; adventure had just begun.  Vietnam didn't yet figure in.

::Late Summer, '65.  Teach-ins began at Berkeley, and started to realize that the Vietnam War was serious business.  Lots of marches, some well-attended, some not.  Kesey participated for the first time and got Angels stoned on LSD so they wouldn't beat us up.  To my knowledge, first hippie-Vietnam War connection.

::Autumn '65.  Lots more acid tests, lots more stoned people, lots more fun.  Owsley moves in with the Grateful Dead on Berkeley Way, just around the corner.  We score some gelatin capsules so he can cap some acid.  Capping party at the Dead house while they play in the corner.  First of several Black girlfriends and connections with Black friends (I'm White).  Vietnam didn't figure in.

::December, '65.  Peyote meetings at Pyramid Lake in Nevada, J.P.'s house in Berkeley.  Native Americans, a teepee and the &quot;Peyote Road.&quot;  Transcendent experience.  Vietnam didn't figure in.

::January, '66.  Everyone is excited.  A unique party at Longshoreman's Hall organized by Stewart, Brand, Kesey and Owsley.  Everyone is going to dress up, a unique sort of costume party.  Visits to Goodwill to buy old mink coats, evening gowns. I buy a pair of knee-high Turkish arm boots, have 3&quot; heals attached.  Girlfriend sews a black silk shirt, purple velvet collar, open to the naval, tied with rawhide.  Hair is growing longer.  Outrageous stoned event with everyone dressed weird for the first time--lots of Native American motifs, beads, strange clothes, colors.  Acid in the punch.  Dead and the Airplane on stage.  Lightshow. Thousands of us partying. Vietnam didn't figure in.

::Later in '66.  We are starting to be &quot;hippies.&quot;  Live in a communal house and have my &quot;harem.&quot; Drop out of Berkeley and lose my student deferment.  Go to the Oakland Induction Center for a physical.  Stoned on acid, get a 1-Y deferrment.  Decide the moral thing to do is to do &quot;public service&quot; working against the Vietnam War full time.

::'66-'68.  Life goes on, and hippiedom emerges from the many currents of life in Berkeley, San Francisco and beyond.  Trip with Cassady in Puerta Vallarta, lots of happenings, lovers.  Despite 100-hour per week involvement, initiatives to end Vietnam bear little fruit.  Turn to other things.

::'68-'70.  Build a hippie truck.  Nomad.  Travel far and wide, lots of rural settings, back to the land, network of friends in California, Oregon and Washington.  Meet Charlie Manson and his girls on the beach in Mendocino.  Hair now down to the middle of my back, wild beard.  Travel with the Floating Lotus Magic Opera Company.  Full-blown hippie.  Spiritual quest begins.  Vietnam is a sidenote. 

::'70-'71. Travel to Renaissance Pleasure Faires in L.A. and Marin, into hand craftsmanship for the first time.  Spiritual quest intensifies. Sell the truck.  Travel to Peru to live with the Quechua tribes and find &quot;my teacher.&quot; Return to U.S. and immediately cut my hair and shave my beard.  Manson is too weird, too evil--it no longer seems cool to be a hippie.  Vietnam doesn't figure in.

:Well, probably pretty tedious reading.  But my central point is that the binding force behind the hippie movement included A LOT MORE than opposition to the Vietnam War.  So I think the article needs to reflect the reality, that's all.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 03:02, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
====sounds like original research====
:::Pretty much seems like original research to me.  One question, aren't you 59 years old or thereabouts?  So you attended college at 17 or so... in 1964.  Any involvement with hippies before then?  Because if we are going to discuss the origin of 'hippies' it has to begin before the media dubbed them hippies, they had to exist long enough to be recognised as a thing.  I somewhat agree with the assertion many folk make that the 60's began in november '63 on Elm St., but we are not talking about the sixties, we are talking about hippies, and the original hippies at that... at least in the opening paragraph I proposed.  Which we need one of, an opening paragraph.  About the beginning.  You maybe didn't have any involvement with the antiwar movement at 17 and 18, but we had dead American soldiers in Vietnam when you were 12.  What I'm saying is that you don't seem to have been in on the ground floor, and maybe it sounds harsh but I'd say you were not one of the original hippies, but one of those who &quot;embraced (what you perceived as being) the hippie lifestyle&quot; -- after it was already whatever-it-was.  You have dropped some big names, and all that, but even if your tale is true, it's [[WP:NOR|original research]].  Please find some references, and I'll put my references up against yours.  We can swap personal stories some other time.  I still say that the core of the hippie movement from 1959 on, especially after Ike's speeches in 1961 about the military industrial complex, was anti-war.  It wasn't a bunch of folk who wanted free love and then took acid, it wasn't beatnicks who decided to put flowers in their hair, it wasn't moral philosophers who wanted to rebel against morality and smoke pot.  LSD didn't start it, pot, fashion, love, sex, it all came after the rebellion against the war and the fight for civil rights... which is where it started.  Let's compile references for our positions instead of dropping names, OK?  [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 06:56, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

Just sharing my experiences, Pedant.  Would never include same in a Wikipedia article--that would be OR.  There is no true &quot;beginning&quot; or &quot;ending&quot; to these stories, but the culture that came to be called &quot;hippie culture&quot; evolved around the time of my involvement.  I was not a key player, but I knew a lot of key players, I saw it evolve and I participated in a minor way.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:14, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Wolof language ==

''&quot;One possible source of the word ''hippie'' is the Wolof language of Africa where &quot;hipi&quot; or &quot;hepi&quot; means &quot;to open one's eyes and be aware.&quot; Many African slaves spoke Wolof and a number of terms made it into contemporary Black slang.  This slang was adopted by the Jazz scene, then the Beatnik scene, finally influencing the hippie movement. [3]&quot;''
(I took this out of the etymology section.)

This appears twice, and I definitely have a problem with it.  The author (of the refernce) states that 'buckaroo' came from 'mbakara' which is not generally accepted among those who study cowboy slang, who state that buckaroo is a corruption of 'vaquero' or cowherd/cowboy... I'd like to remove this unless we can find more than one university professor who has it as his pet theory. Since he is evidently wrong about buckaroo/mbakara/vaquero, I have to say it casts doubt on the rest of his theory.  At any rate we have practically a whole article's worth of Wolof language material, and it's all based on the same source.  I'd like to have that go in a separate article, (and not have it in 2 places if ''not'' removed ), and I would probably be pretty insistent that we don't lead off the etymology section with what I consider a dubious assertion from what seems to me not a definitive source. '''comments?'''[[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 06:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:Let's explore it and see if there is any substantiation of the professor's theory elsewhere.  How about leaving it where it is for now, minus any mention in the etymology section?  I think the correlation between the Wolof language and Black/Jazz/Beatnik/Hippie slang is at least of interest.  Have you visited the Wikipedia &quot;Wolof language&quot; article?  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 06:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

The professor's credentials seem genuine, and he has relevant publications in print, authored in co-operation with others.  Doesn't mean he's right, of course. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:19, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

''&quot;The idealism and popularity of hippydom was essentially carried to the whole world by the new music and emerging [[Creative Arts]], which began to develop as early as the fifties. Once the corporate media got over the drugs, hippies outlandish attire and the fact that its youth were rebelling against its long established institutions, hippies became more organised. They further diversified and removed themselves from the narrow mindset that had been created of them by mainstream reacting in a frightened manner against inevitable changes. Hippies evolved into a diversity of loosely identified tight nit social groups encapsulating the new and freer thinking by championing [[counter culture]] issues on human and [[civil rights]], [[free thinking]] [[spirituality]] and [[religion]], [[self sufficiency]] and [[environmental]] consciousness, [[Feminism]] and [[sexual revolution]], [[free speech]] and [[political freedom]], [[Holistic Health]] and [[alternative technology]].&quot;''

I think it needs a rewrite for tone and POV, and some references.

phrases I think need work:
''&quot;idealism and popularity of hippydom was essentially carried to the whole world&quot;''
presupposes that hippydom was idealistic, we need supporting text for that premise before this para. ...

''&quot;Once the corporate media got over the drugs, hippies outlandish attire and the fact that its youth were rebelling against its long established institutions, hippies became more organised&quot;.''

&quot;corporate media got over&quot; isn't very grammatical, or encyclopedic and presupposes a fixation on attire and drugs, and presupposes a cessation of that fixation -- we need supporting text for that premise before this para. as well...

&quot;outlandish attire&quot; is POV, not supported by prev. text...

''&quot;They further diversified and removed themselves from the narrow mindset that had been created of them by mainstream reacting in a frightened manner against inevitable changes.&quot;''

&quot;mainstream&quot; needs clarification / &quot;frightened manner&quot; is POV, describe the reaction don't characterise it, needs prior text to support... &quot;inevitable changes&quot; inevitable why?  no support, new premise... better would be to describe the changes, and what made them inevitable.

''&quot;Hippies evolved into a diversity of loosely identified tight nit social groups encapsulating the new and freer thinking by championing [[counter culture]] issues on human and [[civil rights]], [[free thinking]] [[spirituality]] and [[religion]], [[self sufficiency]] and [[environmental]] consciousness, [[Feminism]] and [[sexual revolution]], [[free speech]] and [[political freedom]], [[Holistic Health]] and [[alternative technology]].&quot;''

&quot;Hippies evolved&quot; -- individual hippies? or ''The hippies'' or maybe ''hippies generally'' or ''hippies, as a group''?  --  'evolved' has a specific meaning, maybe a better choice available?

&quot;loosely identified tight nit social groups encapsulating the new and freer thinking by championing&quot; -- prefer 'tightly-knit'/'cohesive' or better grammar... &quot;encapsualating&quot; ?  don't know what is trying to be expressed... &quot;new and freer thinking&quot; needs prior text establishing that hippie thinking was new (which does not seem supportable, we have text in the article that contradicts it) and &quot;freer&quot; is somewhat POV, what is meant by freer, lets say that, whatever it is rather than  freer...

as it stands the paragraph doesn't seem to add to the article, it's non sequitur and POV.  [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 20:42, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

==Proposal that [[Hippies (TV series)]] be moved==
I proposed that the [[Hippies (TV series)]] be moved without delay from the top of the page and added to SEE ALSO- Music, books and films. This British comedy which is entirely POV has no place at the head of the hippie article and should be appropriately listed with other films on the subject.  I would also suggest that the person who edited this has a personal vested interest and is using Wikipedia to market this unrelated fiction concerning hippies. Unless there be reasonable basis to have this private film listing at the head of the hippie article I am suggesting that an administrator be contacted. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 21:42, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

:I see your point, Mombas.  I don't know who put the entry there, but I assumed it was just for informational purposes so people could find the other article.  Perhaps you are correct that it would more appropriately be listed among other films on the subject.   Thank you, by the way, for the photos![[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 22:01, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

:I've been thinking about Mombas' request, and I visited the &quot;Hippies: TV Series&quot; article, which refers to a very short-lived article about a program that was briefly aired in 1999 and which was lambasted by the critics.  Given its obscurity, I do not think it deserves prominent placement in the &quot;Hippie&quot; article.  So I moved it to the &quot;Music, Books and Film&quot; section in accord with Mombas' request.  Hope that's O.K. with everyone.  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 10:04, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

::I think that was put there as a 'disambig'/'otheruses' thing. It may be that we need something at the top for that purpose, since [[Hippies]] is a redirect to this {Hippie]] article.  (Not everyone will think to use the search button or add (TV series) to their query, right?) 

::Like Founders4 said, its obscure... I do agree that its a bit silly to give the TV show top billing in this article, but I don't think it's completely satisfactory to have [[Hippies]] redirect here, then bury the link to [[Hippies (TV series)]] in the list at the bottom.  

::I think at some point someone will insist that it be disambiguated, and we may as well make the stylistic choice now on how to deal with it.  

::Maybe use a simple notice at the top of [[Hippies (TV series)]] &quot;This is an article about the TV series.  For the topic of hippies, the countercultural phenomenon, see: [[Hippie]], and if we do that, also change [[Hippies]] into a redirect to [[Hippies (TV series)]] rather than here.  This seems to me to be the best way to handle it, it makes both articles easy to find and puts the disambiguation at the secondary article instead of here. (And keep the entry in the culture section where Mombas and Founders4 have it now.)

::Is that cool with everyone? '''And yeah, thanks for the new photos''' I think this article is moving in the right direction now.

== Christ/Jesus controversy, life of Lao Tzu ==

Hi Pedant. I agree with your change in linkage to the &quot;Ministry of Jesus&quot; article where the list of visionaries appears. There is a problem, however, with the apparent inconsistency of terminology between &quot;time of Christ&quot; and &quot;Jesus.&quot;  Actually the use of the two terms in such close proximity hints at the theological controversy referenced in two other articles--&quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Christology.&quot; (My own view comes close to the &quot;Esoteric Christian view&quot; discussed in the &quot;Christ&quot; article, but this is not mainstream.) In any case, the controversy is too large to address in the &quot;hippie&quot; article.

I'm not sure how to fix it, other than to use &quot;Christ&quot; (as originally) in the list of visionaries, linking it to the &quot;Ministry of Jesus&quot; article.  Or, the previous sentence could be changed to &quot;...the early Essenes who date from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD,&quot; which avoids the controversy and allows a smooth transition from sentence to sentence.  Think I'll try that for now.

There is also a more substantive problem in this section:  unlike the other visionaries, almost nothing is actually known about the life of Lao Tzu, yet his inclusion implies the opposite.  I raised this issue with Momba, and he feels differently (see Momba: Talk). What say you?  Others want to weigh in?[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 16:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

On the question of Christ one should consider that hippies rejected orthodox Christianity wholesale, given the view that Christianity never reflected the doctrines and morals of Christ anyway. Yet the notion of the teachings of the ''historic Christ'' and ''not Christianity'' was adopted by hippydom as better reflecting their beliefs and lifestyle. So whatever links are decided upon, in my view, need to reflect the gospels teachings of Jesus and not Christian religion itself.

On the question of the Taoist founder Lao Tzu (again a central figure or symbol of hippydom) one could also speculate that very little is known about the real life of Jesus too. There is no historical evidence that Jesus Christ actually existed at all other than a few words uttered by the historian Josephus, and the authenticity of these are are disputed by many scholars. The gospels accounts are not supported by history and indeed are universally accepted as accounts by different people from different periods that have been carried from antiquity by sectarian religion.

I am happy to go with the consensus; however the bottom line in my view is that all these visionaries were integral players whose idealogies helped define the hippie movement. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 23:56, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

:I generally agree, Mombas, with your statements about the hippie relationship to Christianity.  With respect to Lao Tzu, the basic problem is that although we have mention of his existence in ancient scrolls, &quot;the details of his life were not contemporaneously recorded,&quot; as the relevant Wikipedia article states.  While there are inconsistencies in the various gospel descriptions of Jesus and his life, we do have a bit more to go on. 

 
:I agree that the Tao Te Ching has from the beginning exerted a strong influence on the development of the hippie ethos.  No argument there.  It's just that when we imply that we know Lao Tzu &quot;exemplified...the cherished hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship&quot; in his life, we have essentially nothing to go on, thus I don't believe we can support such a statement.

:Points up the need for another section--&quot;Defining influences.&quot;  Certain literary works, speeches, ancient texts, and so on had significant influence on the hippie movement.  The ''Tao Te Ching'' certainly belongs here, as do ''Stranger in a Strange Land'', ''the Baghavad Gita'',  ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', ''The Ultimate Frontier'', some of Leary's early writings while still at Harvard (don't recall the names of his published articles, but I know they influence me), transcripts of some of Steve Gaskin's Monday Night Classes, and so on. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

I understand where you are coming from. Would you think that Tao Te Ching would offer the kinds of unconditional support for Lao Tzu if he considered him a person of suspect morals? On the question of the account of any historic Jesus existing in the gospels, you do realise that the Catholic encyclopedia now concedes that there is no historic base to any of the events and saying by Christ.(It is because of the Catholic religion that we have the bible). I guess it’s far easier for us to believe tha a real Jesus existed because Christianities evolution of doctrine is so close to our own culture. While Christians accept that Abraham is the original father of Judaic-Christianity, why can we buy into the notion that Lao Tzu too is the father of Taoism?

:::I'd prefer we use Jesus rather than Christ in ''all'' references from this article to avoid addressing the controversy involved in the whole [[Jesus]] constellation of articles. (whether or not he was a historical figure/whether or not he was divine/whether or not he was resurrected, etc)

:::Since 'christ' comes from 'chrism' (anointing oil) the word christ takes the stance that Jesus was 'the anointed one' which isn't necessary regarding the influences of his life and teachings... which is why I changed the link to point to the ministry article, which focuses on the life and teachings rather than the religion.  

:::He wasn't called Christ until the founding of the church, (I think), traditionally occuring at the moment that Jesus told Peter &quot;you're the rock on which I will build my church&quot;, AFTER his crucifixion and resurrection, so referring to him as Christ in this context opens the whole POV can o' worms that he was in ''fact'' resurrected, and was also 'the anointed one'.  

:::I much prefer Jesus, (in this context) because without reference to whether he was a holy man or an actual historical figure, everyone knows who Jesus was, or are at least familiar with ''who he was said to be'' and the controversy doesn't apply as much to Jesus before death.  And of course, pretty much most of the teachings relevant to Hippies are teachings from his life, and his example of nonviolence etc.... ''prior'' to his execution by 'the Man'.

:::Even if Jesus were thought by someone to be fictional, his teachings can be acceptably referred to without much controversy, like we could refer to the teachings of Valentine Michael Smith, or the example set by The Lorax.  Even fictional characters have influence. (I'm NOT suggesting we put fictional characters in the list).  I think 'Jesus' is preferable to 'Christ' here in this article.  It avoids the question of 'which brand of Christianity' influenced Hippies.  

:::About Lao-tse/Lao Tzu, yeah I think he's gotta be included, maybe not much known about his life but 'the teachings of Lao Tzu' are definitely part of the source of many of these ideas, I know Alan Watts is influential in the hippie culture, and he definitely draws a lot on Lao-tse.  I'm not sure I'm following the controversy about Lao-tse, you both want to include him, right?  Maybe we can ''include these teachers'', without dissecting ''what their teachings were'', because everyone gets something different from each of these teachers.  It would take some very nice editing maybe, but I think it's do-able. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 19:31, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

Pedant. I think we have to be a little careful here. In the main I do believe that hippies rejected traditional Christianity in the sense of the religion, and its various doctrines that evolved through the mainstream churches from around the period of the [[Council of Nicea]]. Rather, hippies adopted the notion of a universal and non religious vision of a nonsectarian Christ, which they believed was the historic person who walked 2000 years ago. We need to remember that Christianity universally condemned the early hippy movement, which they declared to be modern heretics.  It appeared to me that hippies looked to reform orthodox thinking about Jesus Christ, who was accepted by many in the early movement as a very early hippie himself. The name Jesus tends for me to hold too many connotations towards orthodox religion? What do you think? [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 10:39, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
:Let's see some references.  If I was to posit original research and violate NPOV, like say for example claiming the Hippie movement was a political response to Eisenhower, I could easily argue that the Krisna movement was as important an influence as Christianity.

:::The reference you refer to has not been verified because Founders4 won't provide page numbers nor a quote of the passage in question.

Keep in mind that the [[New Left]] movement is treated as a distinct dissent group.  We should replace the now removed section with a new section entitled, &quot;Cultural Dissent&quot; and go from there.  I've got some good cites, and I'm sure you can supply some as well.

== Addition to &quot;Drugs&quot; section ==

&quot;Many hippies gave up experimenting with drugs, other than Marijuana, by the early 1970’s. This was due partly to a fundamental shift in what was available on the market with harmful opiate based addictive drugs like heroine, barbiturate and amphetamine flooding the international markets because big business and heavy criminal elements had began controlling access and distribution. Even LSD the once favoured drug among 1960s hippies as an aid to mind expansion and self discovery, was now nothing more than a tablet containing excessive amounts of harmfull speed and Strychnine. Many hippies believed that this market saturation of killer drugs had been orchestrated by the drug knowledgeable CIA, (MKULTRA), as some kinds of political reaction against the hippies successes in its social uprising which among other things stopped the Vietnam war and highlighted global disarmamnet. - Thousands of hippies and other worthwhile people died as a result of drug adiction in the 1970s. Alfred W. McCoy who is a historian and current Professor of History in the &quot;Center for Southeast Asian Studies&quot;, at the University of Winconsin-Madison, suggests in his book, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade the direct link between the CIA and various drug cartells in Asia.&quot;

:Personally, I was glad to see this paragraph deleted, and now it has been put back.  It is full of spelling errors, punctuation errors, and wildly inaccurate statements (&quot;Even LSD the once favoured drug among 1960s hippies as an aid to mind expansion and self discovery, was now nothing more than a tablet containing excessive amounts of harmfull speed and Strychnine.&quot;) offered with no qualifiers whatever.  Then it devolves into speculative paranoia that has very little to do with hippies, whether we are discussing the 1970s or later periods.  I might try a rewrite, but really I think it just doesn't belong. 

:Corruption of the illegal drug market, including CIA involvement, is a subject that does deserve discussion, perhaps even mention in the &quot;Hippie&quot; article--but not like this. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:39, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 08:00, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

No,not me, Mombas.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

It's a shame Founders that you wont reconsider by taking a second look at the last paragraph of the Drug segment. If anyone can present it in a better light better its you. I happen to believe that the advent of hard drugs in part heralded the destruction and influence of the American hippie movement? [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 10:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

:I agree, Mombas, that hard drugs increasingly became a problem among American hippies.  Personally, I knew to stay away from meth, cocaine and the opiates, and almost all my friends felt the same, but hippies failed as a group adequately to differentiate between beneficial and destructive protocols when it came to drug-taking.   Also, I agree that LSD quality suffered, though not to the extent this paragraph implies--the really bad stuff began to arrive in 1967 with illegalization, though even earlier one  had to be careful to vet one's source.  With due caution, pharmaceutical grade LSD has been continuously available since at least 1960, through Sandoz, Owsley and a succession of Owsley's successors.

:A parallel development that contributed to the demise of the American hippie movement was the trial of Charles Manson, which spotlighted the bizarre (and destructive) aspects of his cult.  It was particularly jarring to hear one's most cherished ideals twisted and bent beyond recognition to justify brutal murder.  Since I knew a number of people close to Manson, and had met him and his girls just prior to the Tate/La Bianca murders, this affected me personally.

:Something along these lines does need to be written.  Thank you for thinking that I might be the one to do it.  If I were to write something, I would not mix in talk about CIA &quot;orquestration&quot; of a plot against hippie &quot;successes.&quot;  Whatever successes we enjoyed came to fruition much later than the advent of the hard drug scene, and the worst of the drug damage occurred during the crack epidemic of the 1980's, in which the CIA was certainly involved.

:Anyway...out of time, as I do need to earn a living.  Meanwhile I think this paragraph needs to go until something better can be devised.  Thanks for your thoughts, as always, and for your contributions. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 16:44, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

::I suggest we pull that section, put it here on the talk page or even a subpage of its own and rewrite it.  Some of it is valuable and some inaccurate, some POV.  Let's take it apart a word at a time if necessary, and find some references to support everything we put in the finished product.  A lot of what I would have to say about the section is my personal opinion and original research, so I'm not prepared to wade into it at this point.  Can we agree to work on it, and remove it from the article until it's really true instead of partly true?  I think the topics addressed are important, but I don't see the section standing a chance of being stable unless we rigorously fact-check it. And remove anything not directly relevant to hippies, where possible.  We have at least 3 active good editors discussing it right now, I think between us we could shape it up nicely.  Would that plan suit the rest of you? [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 19:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

I certainly agree Founders, the Manson event also contributed greatly to a generalized nasty corporate media campaign against all hippies in general. The establishment thought all their Christmases had come at once after the Manson murders and anything hippie was suddenly stigmatized with the Manson factor. Ironically, Manson whom some view as a Judas of the time, was NOT even a hippie. In fact he has claimed in some publications that he actually despised hippies. Bottom line: hippies don’t kill innocent humans, much as true believers in Christ or Buddha contravene Christ’s ethical codes if they too become violent. Your views on the changing drug scene are quite right in my opinion.

Founders and Pedant. I do have some reservation with the “End of an era” chapter. Hippie era did NOT end in 1971 and assumed into mainstream; we just got off the front pages of the tabloid press- that’s all. In fact hippydom shed itself of a few dregs and went threw some kind of metamorphoses or renewal and reinvented itself due to bad press (Manson) and hard drugs. While American hippies have dealt with all kinds of adversities, internationally the movement has boomed since 1971 and continues even today to expand significantly in parts of Europe and downunder. And many of the people behind this expansion come from the early 1960s hipsters. Most hippies no longer dress in the attire of the early sixties; this former dress code is what has now become main-stream. What constitutes a hippy today is not what you physically look like, but what’s behind consciousness and ones perception that one has of oneself and that relationship to people and the rest of the planet. Counter-culture better describes the hippie movement since the 1971. Facts are most people behind the so called new age alternative movements, the greens revolution. etc etc, are mostly foundation hippies who can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s. There are not neo hippies, the movement continued, the issues remained to be resolved, and all that changed to a minor extent were dress codes. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 02:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

:I agree wholeheartedly, Mombas.  Though I have not been called a &quot;hippie&quot; for at least thirty-five years, the values that I internalized during that period continue to inform.  Perhaps symbolically, about a year ago my father returned to me a present that I had given to him in 1971--a leather-bound ponytail of long blonde hair that I had a friend snip off when I dropped the &quot;hippie&quot; label.  As I have engaged in editing this article, it has become apparent to me how much the hippie ethos has influenced the way I have chosen to live and how I have raised my children.  

:At the risk of editorializing, I added the following paragraph a while back:

::At their highest point of awareness, hippies recognized themselves as &quot;conscious creators.&quot; What they created during the 1960s was an attempt to avoid induction into a pre-packaged, materialistic culture where they would be reduced to being mere consumers. As the outward manifestations of hippie culture were incorporated into the mainstream package, those who understood the task of &quot;conscious creation&quot; moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit.

:What I think we need to do is to write a good segue from the early hippie beginnings (which I do think were largely American), mentioning the factors that caused the movement to go underground (as per the above paragraph), specifically Manson and hard drugs, and highlighting the continuing vitality of the hippie movement worldwide.  As time allows, I will attempt something, though this IS very ambitious!

:Regarding the Christ/Jesus issue, in general most hippies I knew rejected conventional Christianity, and I think you are correct that conventional Christianity rejected them.  The Charles Manson debacle was connected with this, as well as with the shift in some circles to the &quot;Jesus movement.&quot;  I had two friends whose entry point into hippie life was through &quot;Charlie,&quot; as they called him, and after the Tate/LaBianca trial they went &quot;Jesus.&quot;  

:While I agree that Manson was NOT a hippie, he exhibited many of the outer trappings of hippiedom.  He played the guitar rather well and could charm a crowd.  His raps were enticing, and he used terms like &quot;The Man&quot; and &quot;The Establishment&quot; throughout.  He maintained a harem of &quot;Charlie's girls&quot; and talked of &quot;free love.&quot;  They lived communally and, when I met them, they traveled around in a schoolbus--just like a lot of hippie folk.  But Manson was a petty criminal and a thug; LSD did not improve him, it just brought out his base qualities. Manson really was/is an evil man.

:Back to Christ/Jesus, there is an important twist that I think we need to consider. If we refer to the [[Jesus]] article, there is a section called &quot;Other views arising from early Christianity.&quot;  In that section, the Gnostic perspective is offered, which is very similar to the point of view of the Rosicrucians and the Masons.  In brief (and with variations among the various groups) this point of view says the following:

::1./Jesus was a man of considerable spiritual advancement who was born to Joseph and Mary and who spent the first thirty years of his life perfecting his physical body in preparation for a certain event.  His advancement was known to his parents and to various of the wise men of the community where he lived, and they oversaw his education, including a trip to Lhasa, Tibet where he could study with other teachers and access an enormous library of ancient texts.

::2./Jesus worked as a carpenter and cabinetmaker, as did his father and brothers, however the main event of his life was pre-planned to take place when he was thirty years of age.  When he was baptized by John the Baptist, he abandoned his physical body while he was underwater and a much more advanced spiritual being, Christ, entered his body.  For the next three years Christ, as the in-dwelling spirit, used Jesus' body to teach and, literally, to &quot;bind evil.&quot; Among his teachings were love, peace, and human fellowship as primary values, along with the specifics of reincarnation, karma, and the eternal nature of the human soul. In the Gnostic tradition it is Christ, not Jesus, who was the &quot;Savior.&quot;

::3./After the agony of the crucifixon, which Christ experienced as the in-dwelling spirit, Jesus' body was resurrected by higher beings working on Mental, Astral and Etheric planes (I know this is getting a bit much, and I promise to conclude soon).  When he appeared again before the diciples, Christ had departed Jesus' body, and it was JESUS who did the rest.

::4./As an afterward to the story of Jesus/Christ/Jesus, the Rosicrucian and Gnostic tratition is that Jesus traveled extensively after the Resurrection, first to the British Isles, then to the Americas.  The oral history of many Native American tribes--in North America, Central America, and South America--supports this point of view.  Paul of Tarsus was instrumental in the development of what became the Roman Catholic Church, and he arbitrarily excluded Christ's teachings regarding reincarnation and karma because he wanted to be able to promise salvation in one lifetime to his new converts. The exclusion of Christ's early teachings regarding reincarnation and karma was formalized at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 A.D.; the Roman Catholic Church and its Protestant derivatives continue in this tradition. 

:OK. Done. This Gnostic/Rosicrucian/Masonic perspective has a direct connection to the hippie relationship to Christianity because of at least one book, THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER, by Eklal Kueshana, which became quite influential in hippie circles and which tells the above story in considerable detail.  I believe we should leave the word &quot;Jesus&quot; in the &quot;Hippie&quot; article pretty much as it stands, as this is a simple and relatively accurate way to refer to the historical/spiritual personage who figures so large in the development of Western civilization.

If you think it inappropriate and unworthy of a fix up, even though it would appear you won’t say why it’s inaccurate, then you delete it yourself. It would appear that it’s difficult to get anything past the self appointed gatekeeper. Right mate ;-)?  And while we are on the subject, I must admit many of the articles which make up the hippie inclusion are woefully inaccurate anyway, and reflect only that minor aspect of the 1960s and 70s social revolution involving the social dramas caused by American youth desperately seeking to find some political solution against serving in that debacle the Vietnam war. Can’t blame them really, and from down-under we helped stop this war too.

But I know there was much much more happening all over the world. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 07:57, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

As it progressed, the development of hippie culture was much more interactive and involved many other parts of the world--for example, the interplay in music between Britain and the United States was especially important and has not been mentioned.

I am the first one to accept that what ever contributions I make to this or any other article in Wikipedia needs as much help as it can get and qualify this by saying that you do a good job in editing. We all have different skills, right. In the final analysis I agree that accuracy is paramount. On the drug article if someone does not feel compelled to correct what ever anomalies exist in it then I guess it will be deleted. Should this happen then I may even reconsider a rewrite myself at a later date. 

I am not intentionally rebuking the domination of Americans in the spawning of hippydom, (give credit where it is due), but more so drawing attention to inaccuracies of the early accounts of what actually transpired at the dawning of the movement. It appears to me that most detail we see in this hippie articles I’ve seen before. Even you have to admit that much of this source has been lifted from various stereotyped blogs and raves from internet sites that have been circulating on the subject for some time.  That does not necessarily render the information correct, right?  To offer two minor examples: 

(a) My understanding is that the word hippie did not come from [[Herb Caen]]s popularizing it in the San Francisco Chronicle. In HIS Wikipedia site which is linked to hippies it’s claimed he in fact invented the word “hippie&quot; during San Francisco's 1967 &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. In my view this is factually incorrect as I have always considerd that the word evolved as part of the swinging music scene of the earlier sixties and derived from hipsters (long trousers worn on the hips by new groovers) which went onto to be coined by the British band The Swinging Blue Jeans hit song of 1963 'Hippy Hippy Shake'. Even Elvis went onto to further develope the ‘hippy hippy shake’ which sent conservatism into a head spin.  To simply change the spelling of the word from hippy to hippie does not give one  the right to claim he invented it for a whole generation of rebelling youth ?  The essential or initial spawning of the hippie movement was music and dance, which came out of the US and Britian. What do you think?

(b) I disagree with the first paragraph that the “movement initially surfaced on United States college campuses and then then moved beyond academic settings etc etc”. I would have considerd that the movement first developed out of the new emerging music rebellion and later it was the anti Vietnam war movement which developed out of the campus?  As you probably remember Universities in the 60s were not only centres of accademic learning but places where disgruntles music freak and others hung out. Many unis were free because our parents generation were still getting over the legacy of the great depression and WW2, believing that education would improve life for their siblings. Downunder the Government actually paid you a wage to go to Uni. 

Just circulating a few ideas. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 10:39, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

As Mombas said ''&quot;while we are on the subject, I must admit many of the articles which make up the hippie inclusion are woefully inaccurate anyway, and reflect only that minor aspect of the 1960s and 70s social revolution involving the social dramas caused by American youth desperately seeking to find some political solution against serving in that debacle the Vietnam war. Can’t blame them really, and from down-under we helped stop this war too. The articles seem to be dominated by issues essentially covering events which the corporate media deemed important to have on their front pages at that time. But I know there was much much more happening all over the world.&quot;''

:[[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] speaking: I heartily agree that this article shows a bias toward the U.S. and its role in the Hippie movement.  I would say that the word 'hippie' has an American origin, and perhaps the first people referred to as hippies were people in the U.S. (not just Americans either), but the hippie movement was quite certainly a worldwide event and I wholeheartedly agree that this article needs much much more of an international scope.  
:The origin of the word hippie, and the initial impetus of the movement may very well have been solely American, but I simply do not know. It would be nice if I could get that info from this article, so seems to me valuable to address the topic.  
:The information available is dominated to a large extent by American media interpretations of events, and thus it is difficult to come up with a true account.  Even hippies were greatly influenced, from the very beginning, by media representations of who they were/what they were.  
:As I seem to recall, the first hippies seemed to almost universally deny that hippies even existed, and rejected the term 'hippies' as being a product of commercial media. Life and Look magazines horned in on the hippie goldmine very early on for instance, and Playboy magazine as well.  I'm sure there are other examples.  
:I'd like to 1)actually dig deeper, as Mombas suggests by implication, into the world outside the US, and the 'hippie' movement in other cultures, as well as what seems to me to be equally important, the nature and extent of the corporate media's influence on the genesis and growth of the hippie movement. If anyone has some sources to suggest or information to include, regarding those two topics, I heartily support its inclusion.
:Meanwhile we should continue improving what we already have.  It may not seem that there is much appreciation for the work we've been doing, but I for one very much appreciate how seriously the active contributors to this article are working on it, a topic many would consider to be mere fluff.  Let's all hang in there, and try to avoid taking any of our discussion personally. Remember, we are working together on a topic which we all are interested in, and the goal is to make it the best we can.  Let's try hard to, well you know, all the stuff we should be doing here.

== This drug segment moved from main page and to be rewritten ==

''Many hippies gave up experimenting with drugs, other than Marijuana, by the early 1970’s. This was due partly to a fundamental shift in what was available on the market with harmful opiate based addictive drugs like heroine, barbiturate and amphetamine flooding the international markets because big business and heavy criminal elements had began controlling access and distribution. Even LSD the once favoured drug among 1960s hippies as an aid to mind expansion and self discovery, was now nothing more than a tablet containing excessive amounts of harmfull speed and Strychnine. Many hippies believed that this market saturation of killer drugs had been orchestrated by the drug knowledgeable CIA, (MKULTRA), as some kinds of political reaction against the hippies successes in its social uprising which among other things stopped the Vietnam war and highlighted global disarmamnet. - Thousands of hippies and other worthwhile people died as a result of drug adiction in the 1970s. Alfred W. McCoy who is a historian and current Professor of History in the &quot;Center for Southeast Asian Studies&quot;, at the University of Winconsin-Madison, suggests in his book, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade the direct link between the CIA and various drug cartells in Asia.''

:Hi Mombas.  Just wanted to mention that I plan to commit some time to incorporating your drug comments under the &quot;Drugs&quot; heading sometime soon.  We do have to be careful not to go beyond our evidence in discussing CIA involvement in the hard drug trade, which I believe was quite limited before the 1980s, at least domestically. CIA involvement in the Southeast Asian heroin trade probably dates from the late 1960's, but that is somewhat beyond the scope of this article.  There may be some connection, however, between heroin use by American soldiers in Vietnam, and their incorporation into the drug scene when they returned.  I'll be working on it.

== Herb Caen coverage ==

Herb Caen is mentioned twice; in the intro and then again in same context in “Pejorative connotations”. This is unnecessary that an employee of the corporate media whose attitude towards a burgeoning hippie insurrection may have been considered by some as negative or to say the least condescending. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 08:31, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

:I sort of think it works, Mombas.  The initial mention is just a note as to Caen's popularization of the term.  The second note explains how Caen's rather gentle, bemused treatment of hippies led to their acceptance of the term.  This section was added because there had been objections that &quot;hippies didn't call themselves hippies.&quot;  True before 1967, but increasingly untrue after that.

:Perhaps he was a bit condescending, but that was his style generally.  Most hippies I knew thought the &quot;hippie&quot; label kind of funny and harmless, so they started to call themselves, and each other, &quot;hippie&quot; as kind of a joke.  

:By the way, Herb Caen was quite independent, hardly a pawn of corporate media.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

Founders, I know you have a soft spot for Herb ;-) and while the discussion has traveled this road in previous edits where it has been suggested (might I add incorrectly) that Herb actually coined the word &quot;Hippie&quot;, I still think the substance behind his contribution to the early hippie scene is thus warranted to be only mentioned just once in this entire article. As it stands his both mentions are repetitive and are saying much the same thing about his popularization of the word “hippie”.

Incidentally, I like the way you handled the Manson issue and I couldn’t agree with your sentiments more. I do wonder though, to what extent Herbs employer the San Francisco Chronicle unjustifiably used the Manson saga to demonise a hippie movement which was essentially quite spiritually and politically devoid from anything surrounding Manson and his lackies. 
[[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 11:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

:I sometimes enjoyed reading Herb Caen's column, though I wasn't a regular reader of his column, or newspapers in general for that matter--just when I happened to pick a paper up on the bus or in a restaurant.  There is no denying that he had a lot of influence in the Bay Area, and that influence continued for many decades.  He could make something &quot;cool,&quot; or not.  Neither he, nor any careful person, would claim that he &quot;coined&quot; the word &quot;hippie.&quot;  But he does deserve credit for popularizing it, which is what the lead says.

:As I see it, the purpose of the lead is to briefly introduce the rest of the article, a summary of sorts.  This is standard practice in journalism, where the &quot;who, what, when, where, how&quot; questions are answered up front so that readers who have limited time or interest can inform themselves without reading the entire article.  When I was writing for a small weekly publication, we were taught to expand on the themes in the lead, in more and more detail as the article proceeded, so that if an editor needed to conserve space he could drop the last paragraphs of the article without making the rest of it unintelligible.  This is not considered redundant.

:It's not that I want Herb Caen in the lead, and also in &quot;Pejorative Connatations,&quot; because I have a soft spot for him.  He is in the lead because he is very well-known, his influence was great, and we probably wouldn't be using the word &quot;hippie&quot; if he hadn't popularized it.  The &quot;Pejorative Connatations&quot; section provides more detail and context. This section begins by explaining why hippies took up the label themselves (following Herb Caen's lead), and it is the repository for the various reasons different groups didn't like hippies, and still don't.  

:As I mentioned, Herb Caen needs to appear in the &quot;Pejorative Connations&quot; section to answer the false charge that ALL reference to hippies during the 1960's was pejorative.  To drop him from the lead, where he has resided for a very long time, would deny important information to readers who choose not to commit sufficient time to read what has now become 14 pages of text.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 17:27, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

==1970s==

I don't get how it is suggested in this article that hippie culture was dead by 1970. The 70's look is just as similar to the late 60's look. The early-mid 70's is pretty much known as the hippy era as well. I don't see how it died in 1970. Maybe 1977-1979 possibly, but not 1970.

:It's a matter of semantics, I suppose.  When you refer to &quot;the 70's look,&quot; you seem to be implying that a certain &quot;look&quot; defined what a hippy was.   

:What the article says is that 1971 is generally considered to be the last year of the hippie era.  The Altamont and Manson factors are mentioned in some detail as catalysts for the waning of the hippie movement in the United States (but not abroad). I'd have to spend some time to look up sources on this, but perhaps you have some alternate sources that place the end of the hippie era later--1977-79.  Can you name them please?  Happy to fix anything that is in error. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 05:42, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

Founders- it is nonsense to say that the hippie culture was all over by 1970. In fact the very first sentence in this article correctly speaks of hippydom in terms of the 1960s and 1970s. May I say that the hippie culture took a severe blow in the LA- San Francisco region late 1960s due to various scandals to which the corporate media manipulated to stigmatize hippies with? Such as Manson, Johnstown, the Jesus Children of God sex scandals and the end of the Vietnam War. Furthermore may I suggest that the initial student uprising of the early 1960s was more political than social *rise up &amp; drop out* and had more to do with reaction against the US Gov sending its youth to die at the unjustified Vietnam War. So when Vietnam war finally over, so did much of the hippie movement dissipate and former hippies, sell out so to speak, and rejoined the system and complete their degrees? However, the true believers moved on and hippydom recreated itself, and the [[back to the land]] movement and spiritual communities thrived throughout the US and overseas in the 1970s. Who do you think the [[Whole earth catalog]] (1968-1989) was serving, thin air? [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 23:52, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

When I make the time I will fill in these gaps as well as create a sub-heading for the hippie movement down-under. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 23:54, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Mombas.  No need for the confrontational tone here.  I never said that the hippie era was &quot;all over by 1970.&quot;  I did say that by 1970 it was on the wane in the United States, which I do believe is rather accurate--and not just in California.  I have no stake in whether the article mentions 1971, or a later date, as the point where the hippie era in the United States ended--didn't write that, and waning is a gradual process, impossible to pinpoint specific dates.

:When you say that &quot;corporate media manipulated (scandals) to stigmatize hippies,&quot; that seems at the very least unsupported, and I believe such blanket statements are spoilers. You have mentioned this sort of thing with respect to drugs as well; frankly, sounds a bit paranoid to me.

:With respect to the above paragraph, I might suggest you clarify your timeline and thinking.  Some specifics:

:-The Manson murders occurred in 1969, the trial took place in 1970, and the convictions came in early 1971.  As I have written these events were quite relevant to the waning of the hippie movement in the U.S.

:-Although the Paris Peace Accords took place during early 1973, the last American casualities in Vietnam were in 1975.  Hard to see any real connection between these events and the waning of the hippie movement, though I suppose war protests no longer brought people together as much.

:-Jonestown was settled in 1975, and the mass suicide occurred in late 1978.  Any connection to hippies seems tenuous at best.

:-The Children of God had very little to do with hippies, except that some former hippies took up with David Berg.   

:The hippie era was full of a lot of magic, and there were also things that went wrong; many of us decided just to move on and did not consider that &quot;selling out.&quot;  Nor did the corporate media have anything to do with such personal decisions.  

:I hope you will add something regarding the development of the hippie movement down-under.  You seem familiar with it, and it would be a good addition to the article--perhaps even an appropriate subject for another article, with appropriate linking, as this one is getting rather long. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 06:45, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

Founders, I apologize if you thought I was being confrontational but I can assure you that this was not my intention, and so perhaps you shouldn’t take criticism so personally. You have been criticized in other discussion pages for being too one eyed in your edits and while I think you have contributed a lot of work in hippie, in my opinion you have become too emotionally involved in this subject which you seem hell-bent on defining on the basis of what you personally saw within the limited time frame of your own hippie experience. 

There would appear to be developing some kinds of consensus that the hippydom did NOT end or even start to wane in 1970, and you must respect this view irrespective of your own personal feelings on the subject. 

I agree that the article is becoming large and that oversized photo thumbs are contributing to its extending kilobytes. I also think that some of the content can be edited out as its too long winded on some subject matter. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 10:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

:Okay.  But when you use the word &quot;nonsense&quot; it does come across as confrontational.  If you didn't mean it that way, so be it.

::&quot;You have been criticized in other discussion pages for being too one eyed in your edits...&quot;

:What discussion pages are you referring to, Mombas?  Whenever disagreements have arisen, both here and with respect to other articles, I and the parties involved have arrived at consensus through discussion and reason.  To my knowledge all such disagreements are currently in a settled state.  Two assertions that the dating is wrong does not constitute &quot;consensus.&quot;  Nor can consensus be achieved through argument by assertion.    

:Someone (not I) long ago wrote that &quot;1971 is generally considered to be the last year of the hippie era.&quot;  Perhaps we should avoid debating the validity of this sentence by describing what actually happened.  I like the word &quot;wane&quot; because it describes a gradual process; the moon, for example, reaches full brilliance, and just at that point it begins to &quot;wane.&quot;  It looks nearly full for quite a while, then fades out over a period of time.

:I do think that in the U.S. the full brilliance of the hippie &quot;moon&quot; was achieved sometime during 1969-70, then it began to wane.  Did that mean that, suddenly, there were no more hippies?...no, of course not.  But as a movement, it seemed to lose steam, and it became less compelling as an ethos that young people were attracted to.  This can easily be documented by tracking the frequency of newspaper stories, magazine articles and so on; pretty easy to demonstrate that as a visible movement hippydom began to fade away in the United States around that time.  Hippies even became the subject of ridicule among American youth with the advent of punk.  

:I have no desire to impose my view, nor should anyone else impose their point of view.  I gather that is what &quot;one-eyed&quot; means in this context--though it's not a familiar term to me.

:So, let's discuss it rationally, Mombas.  What would YOU like the article to say, and what are your reasons for wanting it to say that?  I've given mine, here and previously. If the dating of the waning is wrong, let's figure out why it's wrong and fix it. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 03:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

I do not think this is the appropriate format to be finger pointing, so let’s agree to deal with one issue at the time.

As has been intimated by another concerned editor, the idea that the hippie movement ended or even waned for that matter around 1970 is clearly in dispute.  Where some editor says in (End of hippie era in the United States), “1971 is generally considered the last year of the Hippie Era in the United States” is without foundation and clearly a POV issue. Perhaps for those in California there was good reason to move towards another scene, however, as I have said numerous times before this period heralded a new direction for hippies who began leaving the dead meat of cities in droves and the advent of the hippie [[back to the land]] movements, fostering the [[new age]] of thinking and the [[simple lifestyle]] which were conducive to hard won freedoms. To suggest that hippiedom died in the US from 1971 just because the media had lost its infatuation with the drugs and kids standing up and being heard, is ill-informed to say the least. Perhaps hippiedom waned in the big cities, yes.  With the advent of the post 1970s [[alternative lifestyles]] or [[counterculture]], hippies simply adjusted to the new political climate of the day and moved forward, gaining rather than diminishing. 

This aspect of the article should be re-evaluated and changed accordingly. You can not depict the exact period that this movement died in the US because it exists in strength today. And of course most hippies today no longer wear the traditional attire of long hair and beards and second hand clothing. I know for a fact that hippies (former and new) continue as we speak to be the people behind the International green movements, civil rights movements, [[ecovillage]]s, alternative-[[holistic health]] movements, [[Permaculture]], [[environmental]] movements, anti-war movement..... etc etc. These are not neo-hippies but the continuation of a movement which began to consolidate in the US and England from the late fifties. 

This brings to mind another point to which I think you have already had some discussion with another editor in the [[counterculture]] pages. Clearly there is little indication in the hippie article that Great Britain had any influence on the movement that developed in California. In fact kids were already organising and rebelling in public demonstrations in the streets of London against the Nuclear issue as early as 1958.

Oh and by the way…those images in dispute are too large and should be reduced in keeping with the rest of the images in this article. Perhaps you may have made some agreement with the photographer so that he can sell his photographs, but I’m afraid that if this be the case it controvenes Wikipedia rule. Get the drift ;-)[[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 09:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

:Mombas, what an angling comment!  To imply that Robert Altman, who out of pure generosity allowed us to use copyrighted images so that the hippie article could be improved, has made some kind of &quot;deal&quot; with me so that the photos would appear larger and he could sell photos--outrageous!  Quite the opposite; he risks losing income because others might download the photos from the Wikipedia site and attempt to use them commercially.  My interest in sizing is purely artistic.

:Regarding the discussion with the other editor on the counterculture article, he is working on additions to the article that would clarify the British role, though his time has been limited so it hasn't gone too far.  We have become good friends and are not the least in dispute.  Our communication these days is by e-mail, and I have been encouraging him to enlarge discussion of the interactive nature of anti-war, music and other counterculture activities on both sides of the pond.

Yes, those changes look very good to me. I reworded the subtitle because 1970 wasn't the actual &quot;end&quot; of the hippie era but rather heralding the dawning of a new beginning, so to speak.[[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 09:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

== Removal of original research ==

I removed the quote about Essenes as the source cited does not appear to be reliable, nor does it mention anything abut the Essenes.  I also added a citation request and removed the statements, &quot; The cherished hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship were exemplified in the lives of [[Ministry of Jesus#Teachings|Jesus]] and many other visionaries, among them [[Krishna]], [[Lao Tzu]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Francis of Assisi]]&quot;, and &quot;Hippies did not create a cohesive [[political movement|political]] or [[social movement]] with well-defined leaders and manifestos. Rather the hippie ethos evolved in a complex interplay between leaders and followers as a social manifestation of [[1960s]] [[zeitgeist]]&quot;, as this has gone unreferenced for many weeks now. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 02:25, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:The first referenced sentence reads in full:
::The roots of the hippie movement have been traced to the back-to-nature movement that surfaced in Europe during the nineteenth century, to the naturalist movements of late eighteenth-century Europe, or even to the early Essenes, who date from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.[3] 

:Citation [3] referenced the back-to-nature and naturalist movements mentioned in the beginning of that sentence, not to the Essenes.  We do need another citation (or several) regarding the Essenes.  Don't think this justifies removal of mention of the Essenes.

::The cherished hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship were exemplified in the lives of [[Ministry of Jesus#Teachings|Jesus]] and many other visionaries, among them [[Krishna]], [[Lao Tzu]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Francis of Assisi]]&quot;

:It is not possible to discuss hippies without reference to their cherished ideals of &quot;peace, love, compassion and human fellowship.&quot;  These themes are present in all works dealing with hippies, and the same themes appear in all discussion of the historical figures cited--discussions of their lives, their teachings, their influence, their works or the religions they inspired.  The Wikipedia articles themselves provide adequate citations, though more can be added here if you think it is necessary.   I don't think removal of this entire sentence is justified on the basis that it represents original research. 

::&quot;Hippies did not create a cohesive [[political movement|political]] or [[social movement]] with well-defined leaders and manifestos. Rather the hippie ethos evolved in a complex interplay between leaders and followers as a social manifestation of [[1960s]] [[zeitgeist]]&quot;, 

:Whether we are talking about Dwight D. Eisenhower, Neal Cassady, Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg, Jerry Garcia, Chet Helmes, Owsley Stanley, Alan Watts, Stephen Gaskin, or any other assortment of people who influenced the evolution of the hippie ethos, the aspect of interplay between leaders and followers has been mentioned repeatedly.  Some consensus has developed that this particular way of stating it conveys the reality--it has been changed from what you objected to previously (don't even recall the previous version, it was so long ago), so thought we had answered your objections.  If your objections have not been answered, we can work on that and add whatever references you think are necessary.  Many leaders (Eisenhower and Watts, for example) surely did not consider themselves &quot;hippie leaders,&quot; yet they exerted influence nonetheless.  Most of the other people mentioned above did not consider themselves &quot;leaders&quot; at all--just participants in the process.  Pedant suggested we add a section called &quot;defining texts,&quot; and I agree the article could use that; these were not, however, &quot;manifestos&quot; and some of the works (Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, for example) were fictional.  I do believe this sentence adequately represents the reality and is not original research.  How can we provide references that you would consider adequate?[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 09:06, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:::Everyone is welcome to contribute to this article, but it would be helpful to discuss substantial redactions and reorganisations on the talk page first as there are several people working on this article very actively.  I personally prefer the Eisenhower material and reaction vis the Vietnam war nearer the front of the article, the Vietnam War shouldn't come in in 1963 (Ike's speech was written 1960, given 1961) and first American casualties in Viet Nam were 1959.  Sticking the references to this seminal material into a section labelled 1963-1966 is IMO ridiculous, by 1966 the hippie movement had begun to peak, what might go better in the 1963 section is death of Kennedy, and the impact on the civil rights movement, integral with the hippie movement, and Reverend Doctor King shortly thereafter... 

:::I'm reluctant to add refs to Kennedy and MLK lest this article be descended upon by the 'anti conspiracy theorist crowd' who remove anything they want to brand as conspiracy nut-liness. 

:::It's simply ''not'' original research though, to say that peace and love and a distrust of government were instrumental in the creation of the hippie movement.  What might better be removed is the numerous references to 'disaffected youth' which connotes a high-school aged group of lazy slackers... if the movement was composed of such, it would never have become notable enough for a scholarly article, let alone half a century of dramatic impact on world history.

== Sequential edits to &quot;Hippie&quot; page ==

Hi Viriditas.  During the past month I and several other editors (Pedant and Mombas, in particular) have carefully worked out several compromises regarding the lead to the &quot;Hippie&quot; article.  Many of these changes were made in response to objections you registered a month or so ago.  When you last entered into this discussion, you wanted citations for other items, stated differently, not the lead as it appeared (until today) in its present form. 

I would appreciate it if you could make your approach a bit less precipitous.  Some of what was written was sourced, and some was not--more a function of limited time than an unwillingness to do the sourcing work.  To simply eliminate whole sections seems rash.  And moving the Eisenhower quote and discussion of the seminal impact of the dawning of the Vietnam War to the 1963-66 section weakens the lead, making it choppy and causing a failure in transition.

Finally, fifteen or sixteen sequential edits (rather than a single edit worked out in preview) makes the changes nearly impossible to track and compare. I've reverted to a previous edit for now because I believe the article has been damaged by these edits. 

Can we discuss this please and move a bit more slowly, answering your specific objections and incorporating some of the changes you have made in a more incremental manner? [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:Thank you for sharing your essay-length opinion.  I have removed unsourced comments and I have brought the lead inline with WP:LEAD, although it needs further trimming.  I am sorry that you feel policy &quot;damages&quot; the article. I would address your points one by one, but you'll just accuse me of being a lawyer as before.  Furthermore, I would like to see this talk page refactored, since you are still posting long responses that drown out relevant points. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 08:55, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

I and other editors have had some long discussions, Viriditas.  No one has drowned out anyone though.  We have just discussed the various points rationally, sometimes arriving at considered conclusions, sometimes not.  When you use the word &quot;refactor,&quot; I don't know precisely what you mean. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 09:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:See [[WP:RTP]].  In case you have any doubts, I want to make it very clear that I both respect and admire the good work you and others have contributed to this article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 09:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

Thank you, Viriditas, for your appreciation of our efforts. 

To my mind respect would better be demonstrated by discussion and suggestion rather than the elimination of whole sections of the lead. I just reviewed &quot;Wikipedia: Lead section,&quot; and I believe the lead as previously structured better conformed to policy.  In particular, and as I have already mentioned, the elimination of the Eisenhower quote makes it difficult for the lead to stand on its own--Pedant was especially insistent that this was primary to any introduction of who hippies were.  

BTW, I didn't &quot;accuse&quot; you of being a lawyer previously; I did say that your terse, point-by-point approach reminded me of the way my lawyer friends like to argue.  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 09:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
::Thanks for the clarification.  Regarding the quote, it has no place in the lead, and unless there is a good source drawing a connection between it and the topic, it probably has no place in the article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 09:55, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:::Historical juxtaposition draws the connection: one of the most beloved Presidents in history, an '''expert''' on government and military matters, warns the nation and the world about the military industrial complex, and within a matter of months a worldwide antiwar/anti-government movement begins, and survives for a generation. Vietnam war was only one of the first wars to be recognised as intentionally created (see [[Gulf of Tonkin]]) by the Establishment for the benefit of the Establishment, but note that we left out as much as possible about that and focused on the origin of the Hippie movement, the article is [[Hippie]] not [[War is a tool to make the rich richer]].

:::Without mention of Ike and Vietnam, the article is flat-out worthless, a puff piece on styles and culture.  Hippies were not mere disaffected youths.  Unless this article can hold together as a true and unbiased historical record, dozens of other articles which reference this one fall, and the last half of the 20th century is reduced to a costume party. I assume anyone editing this article is aware of its importance, and I would hope that all of my fellow contributors would work together to make it worthy of inclusion on its merits. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 18:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

::::Without mention?  You mean, in the lead, as it hasn't been removed from the body.  If you have a good source for the above, then add attribution.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:07, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

:::A source? How about a source for 'hippies were disaffected youths'? Yes, in the lead, the info is fundamental to the origin of hippies, and integral to what hippies were.  And you stuck it into &quot;1963-66&quot; care to provide a source for why it goes into that belated dated section? [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]]
::::Did I write that &quot;hipies were disaffected youths&quot;?  If I did, then I would be happy to provide a source.  If I didn't, then I suppose it's up to you to decide what to do since it you find it controversial.  As for the movement of content from the lead to the chron section, it was far too large for the lead.  You can try to summarize to the point you want to make and add it back in, but I'll remove it if it draws an analogy without a citation.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 06:05, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
:::::I disagree with your emphatic statement that the paragraph that introduced the Ike quote and made the connection to hippie identity &quot;was far too large for the lead.&quot;  What makes it too large?  I know no more concise way to define this essential aspect of hippie identity.  As Allan Cohen, founder of the San Francisco Oracle, has written there were TWO equally important aspects to hippie identity--1./ Hippies were outraged at the corruption of govermment by Ike's recently defined &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; and its early expression in the dawning of the Vietnam War, and 2./Hippies sought freedom from governmental interference in their private lives.  As the lead stands, after your edit, only the second aspect finds mention. Ike's &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; phrase appears repeatedly in hippie statements opposing the Vietnam War--this phrase is so specific to Ike's 1961 &quot;Farewell Speech&quot; that no further referencing is required.  What we do need is additional discussion of Ike's speech and its connection to hippie political beliefs, which should probably appear in the &quot;Politics&quot; section.  An interesting sidenote:  Ike originally wanted to call it the &quot;military-industrial-congressional complex.&quot; [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 06:44, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

Viriditas, this in my opinion is one of the worst examples of POV and vandalism I have seen for some time. You have not sufficiently made your case to simply revert. It’s not recommended that recklessly barging your way into an article where a number of other editors have spent some time collectively assessing content, without first discussing at length your personal views on the talk page, thus allowing time for other contributing editors to either support or disagree.  As you will see by the extent of the content on talk page that much of the information which makes up the hippie article has been derived through consensus by the various editors who have worked tirelessly on this subject. I would suggest that you retract the bulk of the edits made by yourself, and to first discuss the changes you recommend.  If you are not happy with a particular citation then good manners recommends that you first allow time with {fact}, before you make your changes.

In particular you did not leave the {fact} on; “The roots of the hippie movement have been traced to the back-to-nature movement that surfaced in Europe during the nineteenth century, to the naturalist movements of late eighteenth-century Europe. The cherished hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship were exemplified in the lives of Jesus and many other visionaries, among them Krishna, Lao Tzu, Buddha and Francis of Assisi”, sufficiently long enough for other editors to deal with, which suggests that you have no hands on experience in 1960-70s hippidom and are offended by this particular inclusion because of personal religious convictions? 

Based upon discussions in this talk page the consensus is against your recent edits and would strongly suggest that you take the time to discuss edit recommendation. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 12:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

==Previous discussion re: the lead section==
[[User:Pedant/Collaboration]] has an archive of a long intercourse on the topic of the lead to this article.  I've saved it in one place because it is a good record of the efforts that have gone before, just in discussion between 2 of us on our own talk pages.  If you don't have time to read long discussions, that is no excuse to make sweeping changes without discussing them.  I would propose as a truism that one cannot write an encyclopedia without reading extensively. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 18:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:Please familiarize yourself with talk page maintenance by summarizing topics for other readers. Similarly, the lead needs to summarize the article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 23:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

::The lead, as previously structured, DID summarize the article, Viriditas.  Now it has a big hole in it.  You have voiced disdain for &quot;essays&quot; (as you describe reasoned discourse), but I see your tendency to employ terse assertion as a transparent attempt to seem authoritative and avoid the burden of supporting your arguments. I find your approach very discouraging, enough to reconsider my investment of time in Wikipedia articles.  I am sure other talented editors must feel similarly discouraged by your approach.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 06:13, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
:::I was just reading Greenfield's hit piece on Leary, when I came across a brief description of hippie culture, namely the &quot;split between those who favored psychedelic spirituality and those who believed in the politics of revolution&quot;.

::::First, sorry if my tone expresses my annoyance... that quote looks fine to me, but why in the lead?  Is that really introductory material?  Would that help someone unfamiliar with the concept of hippies?  Or is it more detailed material that might be more suited to a more detailed section on what hippies ''didn't'' have in common, and keep the lead for stuff they ''did'' have in common?  

::::The summary, Viriditas, is we spent a little over two weeks honing the intro to the article until we were all real pleased with it and you changed most of what we thought was good about it without any discussion, and I'm of a mind to let you rampage around however you like for a week and then come back and look it over.  

::::I don't have a problem with collaboration, but I appreciate more discussion per change than what you seem to appreciate.  Let's see what you want the article to look like, and then get together and discuss what we like and what we don't like about it.

::::and ''&quot;Please familiarize yourself with talk page maintenance by summarizing topics for other readers&quot;'' has somewhat of a superior I'm-taking-charge tone to it.  I am quite familiar with summarising topics, and you are welcome to do whatever summarising you want done.  Everyone I've been working with lately seemed happy with long drawn-out discussions.  If you don't like them, you summarise them, how does that suit you?  All my contributions are available to be mercilessly edited, so go right ahead.

::::I think the lead needs to show the one major thing all the original hippies had in common and it was not youth or disaffected-ness.  It was anti-war and pro-peace, anti-goverment-repression, pro-freedom.  Like that.  It was a beautiful lead that wonderfully expressed that, with all the ideas in support of each other and in a good flowing readable style.  Now it's not.  But let's see what you have in mind, maybe we like it better.  I'm going to be working on other stuff for about a week. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 10:10, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

::Hi, Pedant. The changes involve ''improving'' the article; splitting is needed when articles/sections get too long; the current see also section is more useful as a navigational template linking related articles; we don't use see also the way it is used in the article at present.  If you can justify why the article should ''not'' be improved, it may be interesting to read, but in the end such a position undermines the project.  But, I want to thank you for your comments.

:::::Just reviewed the &quot;Neo-hippie&quot; section.  I think it is useful to the &quot;Hippie&quot; article as it stands.  Splitting it would make sense to me if it were likely to grow; I doubt there is much more to say about neo-hippies, so I don't see that happening.  No strong opinion either way.  
:::::I have personally referenced quite a few of the items in the &quot;See also&quot; section.  It isn't clear to me whether merging it into a navigational template would make the items listed more, or less, availabe to the interested reader.

::::::Converting the see also section into a navigational template wouldn't change the hippie article but instead link all the related articles together, with the template appearing on every linked page instead of just hippie, so it would in fact surpass your expectations.  Regarding splitting sections, this needs to occur sooner rather than later as the page is already too long.  In other news, McCleary's ''The Hippie Dictionary'' appears to support my claim that the term wasn't originally used by the countercultural movement-a claim you deleted from the article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::As you describe the way the navigational template would work, it sounds fine.

:::::If by &quot;originally&quot; McCleary means 1963-66, he is correct.  In response to your previously stated concerns I attempted to clarify this issue (see &quot;Pejorative connotations&quot;) through discussion of Herb Caen's use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; in his columns:

::::::&quot;In popularizing the term, columnist Herb Caen's daily references to hippies mostly expressed fascination and mild amusement rather than disapproval. Following his lead, many participants in the movement accepted the hippie label and used it in a non-pejorative sense.&quot;

:::::By at least mid-1966 hippies had begun referring to one another as &quot;hippies,&quot; using the term rather playfully.  In Stephen Gaskin's Monday Night Classes, which began in 1967 and were attended by thousands of Bay Area folk, he used the term--again, accepting it playfully and warmly.  Perhaps some recordings exist of those classes; I'm not sure--Mombas knows Gaskin personally, so he may be able to inquire.  In any case, some of Gaskin's writings employ the term non-pejoratively.  Would take me a while to dig them up. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 17:18, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

:Not a huge change of heart, just a reconsideration. No strong opinion either way.  When you asked me my opinion, I went and re-read the section.  It brings in some criticism of hippie assumptions that I think are valid--the assumption that rural living is more ecologically sound, for example.  If the neo-hippie article splits, the relevant points can be made independently in the hippie article.  Don't think a separate neo-hippie article is likely to grow, but this is not a serious objection to splitting it.  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

:The two images in the lead represented the two main aspects of hippie identity--the cherishing of personal liberty and political expression with respect to anti-Vietnam war demonstrations.  The third image, How Do! was chosen as a visual demonstration of the ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship.  

:You have arbitrarily deleted primary reference to the anti-war aspect of hippie identity from the lead, Viriditas.  And any mention of the ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship have also been deleted.  I strongly object to these deletions; do you doubt that they can be supported by adequate references?  

:Your move of the anti-Vietnam war demonstration photo is quite inappropriate, and the photo is only effective when sized so that the faces of the participants can be discerned.

:&quot;Usually&quot; is not a rule.  In the case of Hippies, one photo simply does not cover it, nor does your redacted version of the lead text.  Hippies were not simply anti-authoritarian hedonists, as &quot;Dancing Hippies&quot; might imply.  Hippies were not simply strangely dressed, good-hearted, friendly folk, as &quot;How Do! Fellowship in Golden Gate Park&quot; might imply. And Hippies were not simply principled objectors to one of the most unnecessary wars in modern history, as &quot;Anti-Vietnam War Demonstration&quot; might imply.  Only a triad of primary identity factors, both in the text and in the graphics, adequately introduces the topic to readers who have only sufficient time to read the lead.

:I'll experiment with a table (no time this a.m.) aligning multiple images of the same size.  However each of these three photos is an art piece, each with a powerful message.   As such each demands a certain scale to effectively convey that message.  Robert Altman donated these photos to the article because it is a subject close to his heart, and because he recognizes that a current weakness of Wikipedia is very poor graphics.

==Philosophy/ethos sources==
This requires citations: &quot;At their highest point of awareness, hippies recognized themselves as &quot;conscious creators.&quot; What they created during the 1960s was an attempt to avoid induction into a pre-packaged, materialistic culture where they would be reduced to being mere consumers. As the outward manifestations of hippie culture were incorporated into the mainstream package, those who understood the task of &quot;conscious creation&quot; moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit.&quot; &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 01:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

:I'll be working on this, Viriditas.  Relates specifically to the Stewart Brand quote that appears above it, as well as to Gaskin's discussions of &quot;conscious creators.&quot;  Also, in 1970 there was a celebration called &quot;Celestial Synapse&quot; organized by a physicist (don't recall his name at the moment) who was a pioneer in the &quot;new physics;&quot; his teachings regarding the effect of the human thought on matter are relevant.  There was also a book, one of the &quot;defining texts&quot; of the period, THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER by Eklal Kueshana (1963).  &quot;Conscious creation&quot; was discussed in a section called &quot;mental precipitation&quot;--the personal direction of one's thoughts to bring about a desired reality.  I put together the above paragraph as a description of something that became a core hippie belief--that we each create our own realities in accord with the quality of our thoughts.  It's not OR, because I am borrowing terms and descriptions from people who discussed the concepts and wrote about them during the period in question.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:19, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

I'm sick of the damage done to this article.  I think we need to revert to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;oldid=76571207 this] and then edit from there.  I don't object to some of the stuff added recently, but I object to the wholesale disruption of the article since the above edit.  The article has been completely restructured with a heavy hand.  One editor in particular has taken it upon himself to make '''declarative statements about what the article needs''' rather than discuss changes, especially major changes.  Can we get some sense for if there would be a consensus to revert to either the above mentioned point in history, or to some other appropriate point?

:Yes, I am also very upset by the damage that is being done to this article.  Every day brings new deletions (please see topics below), and many of these deletions are completely arbitrary, purely the expression of a single editor's point of view.  

:Particulary disturbing is the high-handed attitude of this editor, who goes by the tag &quot;Viriditas.&quot;  Viriditas exhibits a complete lack of collaborative spirit, a disappointing anomaly in the Wiki world.  And, as I have mentioned below, I believe his heavy-handed pattern of deletions constitutes a clear violation of the 3-revert rule.

:Some of the Viriditas edits, as well as edits by others during the past few days, are worthwhile.  Perhaps we can identify which edits are objectionable and do a partial revert of the affected sections.  In particular I would favor reinstatement of the lead to the form prevailing through September 17, 2006.

:Some of Viriditas requests for sourcing are valid and need to be honored.  Other requests for sourcing seem frivolous at best.

== 'Dispute' and resolution ==
I object to Viriditas' veiled assertion above (originally posted in the call for consensus section) that a call for consensus is an inappropriate avenue of discussion in this case.  

I am quite familiar with dispute resolution procedures.  

The very first step is to ''prevent'' disputes by appropriate discussion on the various discussion pages.  After that, ''discussion'' is important, to clarify that there is in fact a dispute, and attempt to reach a consensus to as to what the dispute is.  The next step is discussion to resolve the dispute.  I am moving all discussion in the consensus section to this new section to maintain a separation between the call for a consensus and the assertion that there is a dispute, discussion on what the dispute is and how to resolve it. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 16:57, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

From [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes]]:

''&quot;Failure to pursue discussion in good faith shows that you are trying to escalate the dispute instead of resolving it. This will make people less sympathetic to your position and may prevent you from effectively using later stages in dispute resolution. In contrast, sustained discussion and serious negotiation between the parties, even if not immediately successful, shows that you are interested in finding a solution that fits within Wikipedia policies.&quot;'' [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 17:15, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== Drugs--Kesey's Introduction to LSD during the CIA's MKULTRA program ==

Earlier today Viriditas removed in its entirety the last paragraph of the &quot;Drug&quot; section.  It read:

:The psychotropic drugs that were adopted by hippies were introduced in part during CIA project MKULTRA, which tested the effects of various drugs and other treatments on numerous Americans, often without their consent. While a student at Stanford University, Ken Kesey himself was a volunteer subject in one of the many drug trials promoted by the MKULTRA project, and it was during these trials that he was first introduced to the use of LSD.

I wrote the following to Viriditas:

:Ken Kesey's introduction to LSD during MKULTRA experiments while he was a student at Stanford had a major impact on hippie history. In fact it is hard to imagine hippies becoming what they became without LSD, and Kesey was intrumental in popularizing its use. I see no justification for removing this reference--once again Viriditas, it is an arbitrary deletion. Please reinstate it. If you do not reinstate it, I will. There is no excuse for not including relevant information in the article, your own prejudices aside.

Viriditas responded:

:Thank you for your concern, but if you want to discuss articles, please use the talk page of that article. You may use my talk page to notify me of things of interest, however. I'm quite familiar with the subject, and there most cetainly needs to be a section in the article about it, but the paragraph in question has little to do with the topic. Stay focused on hippies, and you will find the article writes itself. To start with, if you want to write more about this subject, try to expand the Timothy Leary paragraph first.

First, Viriditas, I am focused on hippies, and the manner of Kesey's introduction to LSD is directly relevant to hippies.  It is relevant because without Kesey, his Pranksters and his Acid Tests, the use of LSD might never have become widespread among hippies.  It is also relevant because hippies were convinced that the United States government had become corrupt and was running roughshod over the rights of ordinary Americans; the abuses perpetrated by MKULTRA, including the administration of LSD to unsuspecting Americans, is directly related both to the topic of drugs and to the general theme of corruption in government.

Second, you seem adept at deleting things, but so far I haven't seen you contribute to the article.  Several editors, myself included, have gradually built the article up over the past few months.  We have endeavored to include all relevant content submitted by other editors, welcoming their contributions and incorporating them to the fullest extent possible.  When disagreements occurred, we have worked diligently to construct compromises. While some of your deletions are fine, many have not been based on specific objections (sourcing, for example); they have in fact been arbitrary, purely expressions of your personal point of view.  When we have objected to these deletions--as I, Mombas and Pedant have repeatedly done--you have not answered our objections; rather you have responded in a high-handed, dismissive manner.  I do not find this approach acceptable.  

Your response here is similar.  You agree that there needs to be a section discussing MKULTRA in the &quot;Hippie&quot; article, but rather than writing such a section, or suggesting where you think the information would better be located, you simply deleted the information.  Then, rather than discussing the points I raised, you arbitrarily dismiss them and direct me to &quot;expand the Timothy Leary paragraph first.&quot;  Very much like a teacher instructing a somewhat misdirected student.

Well I'm not your student, Viriditas.  I am a co-editor of the article.  And I believe your constant deletions, especially given the fact that you have repeatedly ignored objections by myself and other editors, constitute a violation of the 3-revert rule.

So once again I will ask you politely.  Please reinstate the information you deleted regarding Kesey's introduction to LSD during the CIA's MKULTRA program.  06:56, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
::Please try to keep your comments brief and to the point.  This article is about hippies.  The tangential narrative regarding other issues should be incorporated into the article.

You write: &quot;The tangential narrative regarding other issues should be incorporated into the article.&quot;  Isn't this exactly what the deleted paragraph did?  Since Kesey was such a primary figure in introducing LSD to the hippie scene, his use of this drug IS relevant to this article. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 17:52, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
:The statement you  added back in is not substantiated, focuses on only one aspect of drug distribution, and places importance on content that lies outside the scope of this article.  The drug was being used by academics and professionals, and was legal for some time. Leary, Owsley, Kesey, and others were important, the CIA much less so.  Kesey's own experience is interesting in the context of his life and career as an author, but less so in an article about the Hippie movement as a whole.  You would do well to find a citation in ''Storming Heaven'' to support this aspect over the others I mentioned.  For the purposes of NPOV, isolating and inflating one aspect over a multitude of others is POV pushing. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 19:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
::The statement I reinstated was well-substantiated in 1977 Senate Hearings during which the CIA acknowledged testing the effects of LSD, mescaline  psilocybin and many other drugs on unsuspecting Americans, leading to at least one substantiated death.  More legitimate CIA drug testing occurred during voluntary drug trials conducted at facilities near many universities, including the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital near Stanford.  Kesey has written extensively about his introduction to several psychotropic drugs, including LSD, at the Menlo Park facility. 

::Had Kesey been only a well-known author, I would agree with you that the manner of his introduction to LSD would be unimportant to the &quot;Hippie&quot; article.  As it was, however, his prominence during the early hippie years, especially his promotion of the Acid Tests, elevate the importance of this particular aspect of his life.  I purposefully used the term &quot;in part&quot; and kept it short so as not to exaggerate the importance of MKULTRA.  

::I agree that the &quot;Drug&quot; section needs expanding to include discussion of other seminal players.  I agree that LSD was widely used among academics and professionals--having grown up in Berkeley, half of my parents's upper-middle-class friends had taken LSD by 1965, and my stepfather threatened to synthesize a batch at his UC Berkeley Rad Lab. But, since I have been acquainted with him for forty years now, I also happen to know that Owsley  began to produce LSD only after Kesey introduced him to the drug.  (Wouldn't write this, of course--too OR.)  His girlfriend, Melissa, was a chemistry major at Berkeley, and she provided instruction.  Owsley probably did more than any other individual to bring LSD to the &quot;hippie masses,&quot; but he probably wouldn't have done that without Kesey, and Kesey probably wouldn't have dropped acid without MKULTRA. 

::I would prefer to de-emphasize the importance of MKULTRA by adding to the &quot;Drug&quot; section rather than deleting information that is both true and relevant.  I'm not pushing anything.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:26, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion of a specific point about drugs. ==

Viriditas, you removed the following sentence:

:The use of these drugs became common in hippie settings, both because of their psychopharmaceutical effects and to express disaffection with societal norms. 

You attached a comment:

:Remove obvious statement (Yes, drugs have effects, no need to sat it unless we are describing it). Rm unsourced speculation re societal norms.)

I believe you may be missing the point this editor (not I) was trying to make, or perhaps his point was not stated clearly enough.  The editor was trying to emphasize that hippies sometimes took drugs not just to get high but also in a spirit of conspiratorial rebellion agains &quot;societal norms.&quot;  It may not be a major point, but neither do I see any reason to delete it.

Also, is there really any doubt that smoking marijuana and taking mescaline, psilocybin, LSD and other drugs were contrary to &quot;societal norms&quot;?  This is hardly &quot;speculation&quot; and does not require sourcing. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
::If so, it should be easy for you to find a good citation. I know of many sources that claim that hippies were taking drugs to pursue happiness, get in touch with themselves spiritually, and to experience altered states of consciousness.  If you are going to give reasons for a particular type of behavior, it's best to give attribution. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 10:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

:::Perhaps I misunderstood.  You were not asking for sourcing of what societal norms were; you were asking for sourcing regarding the assertion that hippies used drugs &quot;to express disaffection with societal norms.&quot;  As I've mentioned, I did not write this sentence, though I did edit it to make the point more presentable. My general policy when someone takes the time to contribute to this, or any other article, is inclusion wherever possible.

:::I do think what this editor wrote is true, though to what extent I don't know.  Probably a hard one to source though.  If you leave it alone for awhile, I'll keep my eyes open.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 05:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

==Category:Politics==
[[User:Pedant|Pedant]] added the top-level [[:Category:Politics]] to the article for some reason. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77153557]  The other category, [[:Category:Hippie movement]] is already a member of Politics through the appropriate cultural categorization, namely [[:Category:Social movements]] &gt; [[:Category:Activism]] &gt; [[:Category:Politics]].  There is also a message on Category:Politics that asks editors to &quot;diffuse articles into relevant subcategories as needed..If an article exists in both this category and a relevant subcategory, or it simply does not belong, remove its category marker,&quot; which has already been done with the use of Category:Hippie movement.  It is also interesting to note what [[Eric Donald Hirsch|E.D. Hirsch]] says about the Hippie movement: &quot;Their movement was fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest.&quot;  Other writers, historians, and academics tend to agree.  I would ask at this time that Pedant revert his addition of this category. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 03:11, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
::Most assuredly the hippie movement was both cultural AND political.  Some hippies were apolitical, while others were intensely political.  As the &quot;Politics&quot; section states:

:::The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were completely apolitical to Yippies, the most politically active hippie sub-group.

::The [Bob Fass] article (see &quot;Midwife to a Movement&quot;) gives a good summary of East Coast hippie poltics.  His WBAI New York &quot;Radio Unnameable&quot; program spotlighted many key events, among them Abbie Hoffman's August, 1967 anti-capitalist demonstration at the New York Stock Exchange, the October, 1967 proposal to levitate the Pentagon during a mammoth anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, DC, and the Yip-In at New York's Grand Central Terminal in March, 1968.  Of course there were also the August, 1968 Democratic Convention protests in Chicago, the May, 1969 People's Park protest in Berkeley and innumerable other events.

::One might say that West Coast hippies were less political than East Coast hippies, however even West Coast cultural happenings--such as Berkeley playwright Daniel Moore's Floating Lotus Magic Opera Company performances--were imbued with deep political meaning.  Floating Lotus' &quot;Bliss Apocalypse&quot; (http://www.danielmoorepoetry.com/theater/blissApocalpyse.html)was a deeply moving statement against the Vietnam War.

::I think Pedant was correct to add the top-level [[:Category:Politics]] to the article. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 06:39, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

::What SF Oracle founder Allen Cohen said in his 1995 essay, &quot;A New Look at the Summer of Love&quot; (http://www.net.info.nl/cohen/) is quite relevant here:

:::&quot;There were two aspects to the experience of the 60s: the resistance to the war, and the psychedelic experience, personified as political activists and hippies. For the most part these two vectors overlapped in the same individuals, so that many of those who actively resisted the Vietnam war had used LSD and smoked marijuana. As a society we have tried to understand the sixties mostly as political resistance to the war, but have mostly ignored and denied the changes in values and culture brought about by psychedelic experiences.&quot; 

::You have written that hippie politics was &quot;gentle and non-doctrinaire.&quot; True, as far as it goes, however this did not apply when it came to opposition to the Vietnam War.  Normally gentle and non-doctrinaire hippies were also, as Cohen wrote, ardent political activists.  Your edits of the lead continue to de-emphasize this important aspect of hippie identity.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
:::No, I did not write that; it is a sourced citation.  Please stop accusing me of doing things and stick to the topic.

::::I am not &quot;accusing&quot; you of anything, Viriditas.  If the &quot;gentle and nondoctrinaire&quot; sentence is a quote, you need to put it in quotation marks.  Otherwise I, and others, will assume you wrote it, employing your own choice of words, BASED ON the sourced material.  That's what I mean when I cite a source without using quotation marks or some other device to indicate that it is, in fact, a direct quote.
::::Yes this article is about hippies. And we know that this distinct group of people came into existance before the word that generally describes them came into common usage.  By 1966 Caen had begun to use the word to describe them, and by 1967 the word had become the preferred word for describing them.  That does not mean that an earlier source is not legitimate just because it does not use the word &quot;hippie;&quot; the issue is who is being described. Even the counterculture article states:
:::::&quot;The most visible radical element of this counterculture was the hippie.&quot;

::::My only point here is that there is some overlap.  And I would maintain, as I have previously, that the hippie movement began during the early to mid-1960s.  Lots of folks agree. Apparently some don't. There are sources to support both points of view.

==Ethical libertarians==
I've placed a cite request for the statement that states, &quot;Hippies were ethical libertarians and believed that the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution guarantee the rights of individual citizens to do as they wish with their own persons and property, as long as they do not infringe on the same rights of others.&quot;  Sounds great, but the references in the article do not support that claim. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 04:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
:The Bill of Rights doesn't say that?  I'm pretty sure that that's exactly what the 9th and 10th amendments do: guarantee hippies those rights.  [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 06:43, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

==Alternative press==
This seems to be one of the greatest success of the Hippies, yet there is very little if anything on this page about it.  It would be quite lengthy, so eventually it would have to be split to just one or two paragraphs.  The section should include the following seven publications:
# ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]''
# ''[[Berkeley Barb]]''
# ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]''
# ''[[The East Village Other]]''
# ''[[Chicago Seed]]''

:There is a problem with your rewrite of the lead paragraph. 

::Hippie, occasionally spelled hippy, is a term used to refer to members of a countercultural movement that began in the United States in the late 1960s, eventually spreading to Europe before fading in the late 1970s. [1] Initially surfacing on United States college campuses, it moved beyond academic settings to most major cities in Canada, Great Britain, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. To a lesser extent hippie influence was felt worldwide, particularly in Eastern Europe, Mexico and Japan.

:The first problem is internal inconsistency, in that the lead sentence now says that the hippie movement began in the United States and then spread to Europe.  Then the paragraph  goes on to say that the movement moved to most major cities in Canada, Great Britain, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  Then it mentions the other places where the movement had significant, though lesser, impact.  This way of stating things is awkward at best; saying it spread only to &quot;Europe&quot; in the first sentence, then immediately adding in all the rest, creates significant cognitive disconsonance for the reader.  Of course &quot;Europe&quot; can be construed to mean Great Britain, Western Europe and Eastern Europe, but not Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Japan.

:The second problem, perhaps more serious, is that the article now says that the hippie movement BOTH &quot;began&quot; during the late 1960s and &quot;reached its height&quot; during the late 1960s.  These two statements appear further apart in the article, however the alert reader will rightly wonder what might be the reality.

:The third associated problem is that, despite your sourcing, the statement is flat out wrong.  A &quot;movement&quot; requires time to gather steam.  If we define the late 1960s as approximately mid-1967 to the end of 1969, we are saying that this movement began, spread worldwide and reached its height during a 2 1/2 year period.  That is not the way it happened, and anyone familiar with the period will say &quot;Nonsense.&quot;  The beginning of the hippie movement is difficult to pinpoint because it evolved from the beat movement of the 1950's.  But we can at least say the beginnings were there during Kesey's 1964 summer trip in &quot;Further,&quot; which combined elements of both beat culture (Cassady, Ginsburg, Kerouac) and hippie culture (Kesey, the Grateful Dead)--with no clear line drawn between them.  Some would put the &quot;beginning&quot; earlier.  There is a lot of room for interpretation with respect to the beginning, development and peaking of the hippie movement, but if your source says that the hippie movement began in the late 1960s it is an unreliable source.

On September 23, you added a reference to the Schaffer Library of Drug Policy, making it seem like the source drew a connection between hippies and MKULTRA.  There is no such connection at the source, nor is there any mention of a notable connection in any historical research I have done. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=77318986&amp;oldid=77305167]  In your favor, there are two popular books, ''Storming Heaven'' and ''Acid Dreams'', which discuss this topic, but you have not made use of them, nor is there any way to verify the notability of the relationship between hippies the subgroup, and human experimentation.   On the same day, you changed a sourced definition by E.D. Hirsch, and added information that is not contained in the original source. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=77326212&amp;oldid=77319229]  You engaged in the same falsifiation of sources by editing the same passage, this time you failed to pay attention to the source (a personal web site about Rock music), as it is not relevant to the context, nor is it as reliable as Hirsch, and in point of fact contradicts your claim altogether. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=77429301&amp;oldid=77411006].  Since that time you have continued to add sources, of which I fear do not represent the claims in any way. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77430107] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77434632] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77435397] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77436434] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=77443735]  This is a very serious problem, Founders, and I will be reverting the most egregious errors to prevent this article from turning into your personal essay again.  I suggest you take a break from Wikipedia and review the citation policies, because if this behavior continues, you give me no alternative but to escalate the dispute resolution process. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

:::Viriditas I have never speculated as to your emotional state.  I have said it is sometimes difficult, given your actions, to assume good faith on your part.  When I read your comments to Pedant (on his talk page, not in this discussion) I commented that you seem to &quot;pretend innocence&quot; in your bafflement as to why you have offended him (and me and Mombas); this may have been slightly over the line, though not much because we have repeatedly told you what we find offensive and you have not in the least changed your behavior.

:::I have never falsified a citation in my life.  I have written one full-length book with scholarly attribution and I consider your charge a serious one.  As I have written before, I am not a full-time researcher and encyclopedia writer.  I source what I can as time allows, taking care of the easier things first.  You invited me to add to the article in order to correct what I perceived as a serious error; I did so, and I cited a source that, contrary to your assertions, pegged the beginnings of the hippie counterculture movement to the early 1960's.  I did so without trying to disturb the Hirsch source that you say (I haven't checked) pegs the beginnings of the hippie counterculture movement to the late 1960's; my intent was to convey that there is some difference of opinion as to when the hippie counterculture began.  I notice you have changed the lead to avoid this controversy and to clarify the geographical issue; I previously requested these changes, however you refused any discussion and deflected my concerns.  I am glad you finally decided to make this change.

:::The September 3 &quot;falsification&quot; you note was nothing of the sort.  The reference I provide was in support of the first part of the sentence, not the last:

::::The roots of the hippie movement can be found in the naturalist movements of late eighteenth-century Europe and the back-to-nature movement that surfaced in Europe during the nineteenth century.

:::There was no intent to mislead the reader, and I readily agreed with you that we would need more sourcing on the Essenes (not my idea to include them, by the way, as I realized that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to source).

:::The September 23 cite was in direct response to your specific objection that there was no substantiation for the first sentence of the paragraph, which read:

::::The psychotropic drugs that were adopted by hippies were introduced in part during CIA project MKULTRA, which tested the effects of various drugs and other treatments on numerous Americans, often without their consent.

:::If you read the transcript of the Senate hearings, you will see that they directly support what this sentence says.  That the drugs in question (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and others) were adopted by hippies is common knowledge and no reasonable person could dispute this.  I put the cite at the end of the sentence where it belongs to support the fact that the CIA MKULTRA project &quot;tested the effects of various drugs and other treatments on numerous Americans, often without their consent.&quot;  There was no intent to mislead, and neither the sentence nor the cite mislead the reader.

:::The sources I have added today are, in some cases only partially support the sections to which they apply.  As I mentioned with respect to the &quot;Philosophy/Ethos&quot; paragraph it would take me a week of full-time work to do the research necessary to fully source this paragraph.  I can provide the sourcing you requested, however I told you I would do the easy sourcing first, then move on to the more difficult items.  Citing Kueshana's ''Ultimate Frontier'' is an example of this.  This book was widely read among hippies and frequently discussed during the era.  Kueshana writes of the power of the human mind to affect material reality through the process of &quot;precipitation,&quot; or &quot;conscious creation.&quot;  This paragraph is my work, a summation of various works (including some primary sources) that date from the 1960s.  When I cite a source, I am not claiming to QUOTE that source--if I were to do that I would put the material in quotation marks. This is a perfectly legitimate way to present the material, and it is relevant to this section because it directly supports Stewart Brand's ''Whole Earth'' statement, &quot;We are as gods, and we might as well get used to it.&quot;  (Incidentally, Stewart later changed this in later editions to read &quot;We are as gods, and we might as well get ''good'' at it.) 

:::I have no desire to make this article my personal essay, and I have drawn a clear line between original research and the inclusion of permissable material.  Please be sure that YOU have no desire to make it your own personal essay. 

:::Meanwhile I demand a retraction of your charge that I have falsified citations.  If you choose not to retract your charge, I demand that you refer our conflict to an appropriate administrator. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 01:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

There is one way to set the record straight; we create a subpage for citations only, with page numbers and actual text used for each source.

:::::They show that I am citing sources that SUPPORT THE CONTENT of the passages I write.  An exact MATCH between a passage and its source would be a quote.  I am not QUOTING the sources.  Writing a sentence or paragraph in one's own way and using the source to support the facts it is based on is perfectly legitimate, and no one in any venue, including the strictest academic settings, has ever questioned this practice.   

:::::Once again you accuse me of speculating as to your emotional state.  What are you talking about, Viriditas?  The most I have said is that it is hard to assume good faith on your part BECAUSE OF YOUR ACTIONS.  I am not speculating about how I think you act; I am observing how you act.

===Sourcing in General ===

From the Wikipedia article &quot;Tertiary source&quot;:

:&quot;Encyclopedias and textbooks are examples of materials that typically embrace both secondary and tertiary sources, presenting on the one hand commentary and analysis, while on the other attempting to provide a synoptic overview of the material available on the topic. For instance, the long articles of the Encyclopædia Britannica certainly constitute the kind of analytical material characteristic of secondary sources, whilst they also attempt to provide the kind of comprehensive coverage associated with tertiary sources.&quot;

As I understand it we are writing an encyclopedia.  We must provide sources for the facts presented in an article, preferably a selection of primary, secondary and tertiary sources that help establish some consensus as to what the facts are.  However this does not preclude the inclusion of limited commentary and analysis that help knit the whole thing together.  Without an intelligent, synoptic approach the articles that emerge will be worthless.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 19:13, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

It's hard to get a handle on this dispute.  The article itself appears to be mostly accurate and balanced, although some sections could use better citation.  I think citation requests would be more appropriate than content deletion for passages where editors agree the existing text is probably true. '''[[User:Durova|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Durova&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 17:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
*I agree it's hard to get a handle on this dispute. Will one of the disputing parties please explain what their issue is? [[User:AndyJones|AndyJones]] 19:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
*The issue is that several editors have been working together on this article for weeks and then Viriditas suddenly ''with no discussion'' made extensive changes to the article; deleted material ''without discussion''; complained about the length of comments made by other editors ''attempting to discuss his edits'' with him; made declarative statements about what the article needs and ''refused discussion''; generally acted in a high-handed uncivil manner, advised us to 'familiarise ourselves' with dispute resolution procedures, while at the same time ignoring foundational steps to the dispute resolution process (primarily the 'prevent dispute'/'discuss disspute'/'disengage from dispute' processes); prematurely brought this to an RfC in an abuse of process, skipping preliminary steps of resolution, citing [[WP:OWN]] and editing the policy content at [[WP:OWN]] in an apparent attempt to tailor the policy to this discussion.  Incivility.  Disruptive mass edits. Responded to a call for consensus with ''&quot;Please pursue dispute resolution through the appropriate channels.&quot;'' Viriditas placed the RfC, he should have made it plain what the dispute was.  As far as I'm concerned the entire thing hinges on Viriditas' refusal to discuss major changes to what was a stable article. [[User:Pedant|User:Pedant]] 05:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

:During the past week Viriditas has pursued a relentless policy to restructure the &quot;Hippie&quot; article so as to eliminate primary elements of hippie identity, in particular the political aspect of that identity.  Prior to September 17, 2006, several editors (myself, Veriditas and Mombas to name just a few active editors) had carefully worked out compromises that resulted in a balanced lead we could all be happy with.  Some of it needed sourcing, true, but nothing in the lead we constructed was manifestly untrue.

:Viriditas had offered extensive criticism of the article about a month ago, and a lot of that criticism had been answered with constructive changes during the past few weeks--expanding certain sections, qualifying statements that were too broad and so on.  When Viriditas returned on September 18, 2006 he began with wholesale deletions of many sections, completely ignoring our objections and demonstrating NO willingness to discuss the issues or collaborate.  His approach was high-handed, and he repeatedly implied that his views were uniquely consonant with Wikipedia policy. 

:I would be happy to work with Viriditas on any of the points in question, but I do not think it is appropriate for him to continually talk down to the other editors of this article.  The single most important thing he can do, in my opinion, is to stop deleting things we have worked so hard to construct.  The other thing would be to stop ignoring our objections when he trashes things.

:I have tried to refrain from personally attacking Viriditas, but I must second Pedant's short comment--oh yeah, http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick too. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

::If this summary is correct then my initial guess was pretty near the mark.  While verifiable sources always help an article and while it would be good to take down doubtful statements when requesting verification, this particular instance seems to be overzealous.  Rather than delete material that is probably true, please tag it with a request for citation and/or discuss it on the talk page and give a reasonable time frame for verification before deleting.  To my eyes the article seems to have been pretty much on target.  Harmonious editing means respecting existing consensus unless there's real reason to believe the article is distorted in some way.

:::Thank you, Durova, for reviewing this matter.  I agree that we need to resolve our differences through discussion and compromise, and we need to cite sources as quickly as possible whenever verification is requested. My own personal preference is to facilitate the inclusion of new material and viewpoints whenever possible, deleting material only when absolutely necessary.

*As far as I am concerned it’s futile for editors to spend copious amounts on time on reaching consensus concerning content for Wikipedia articles , and then for the likes of Veriditas to simply mussel his way in and make fundamental structural changes to the article without first seeking to  discuss what he has in mind. I for one have resigned myself to accepting that this article has in the main now lost its original flow, and is now reduced by Veriditas’ contributions which he makes without seeking consensus. Unfortunately you will find that editors will simply throw in the towel after spending months meticulously working on content, and then the agreed content is trashed by editors like Veriditas who manipulate Wikipedia guidelines to control the article within his/her personal criteria.

== Being bold ==

Dear friends: I have no ax to grind, only the desire to improve this article, among the others I am working on. As you will notice (or may have noticed), I have considerably shortened the introductory section, reducing it to its basics. '''None of the material has been deleted''' — just moved to its natural place in the rest of the piece.

I've read some of the comments in this Discussion section, and I believe all the participants have one goal — to improve the article so it is useful to the person who is seeking information (think of a kid in middle school or someone in Japan or South  Africa who wants information about the Hippie movement of the 1960s). The objective is to write both clearly and accurately, and I might add '''succinctly,''' because this article is already too long, as the Warning cautions at the top.

Anyway, as I move through this fine work in progress, I intend to be bold in editing, but I hope to make changes (if needed) in small chunks so each of you can examine them piecemeal and see if you agree with them or not.

Yours sincerely, and in great good faith, [[User:GeorgeLouis|GeorgeLouis]] 17:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks, GeorgeLouis.  Just noticed this note.  I agree that &quot;small chunk&quot; changes are best as they lead to incremental improvement over time. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 09:15, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:Until fairly recently, the &quot;Etymology&quot; section was located after the &quot;History&quot; section, and I was comfortable with that location.  Then another  editor moved it to the beginning, which is certainly more logical--though as you say it does make the article get off to a slow start.  I voiced that objection at first.

:Just revisited the &quot;Etymology&quot; location and went through the article, trying to imagine it being relocated. Couldn't do it.

== Radical Edit of Hippie Lead ==

Hello GeorgeLouis.  The lead of an article is intended to provide casual readers with the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject matter without reading the entire article. It is a summation of the rest of what the article says.  The lead should answer, as succinctly as possible, the who, what, when, where, why and how questions of traditional journalism.  Readers who wish to learn more can then move on to the rest of the article as they see fit.

Your radical edit of the &quot;Hippie&quot; lead does two things:

1./ It deprives the casual reader of this opportunity.
2./ It introduces the material (thanks for not deleting most of it, by the way) into the rest of the article in a rather disjointed way.  In particular, since the lead as previously written summarized aspects of the rest of the article, it creates redundancies.

You deleted most of the first paragraph of the lead:

:'''Hippie''', occasionally spelled '''hippy''', refers to members of a [[counterculture|countercultural movement]] that began in the [[United States]] during the 1960s.  Initially the movement surfaced on United States college campuses, then moved beyond academic settings to most major cities in [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].  To a lesser extent hippie influence was felt worldwide, particularly in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]].  There is general agreement that the movement had significantly faded by the late 1970s, especially in the United States. 

This first paragraph answered many of the who, what, when and where questions (why and how were addressed later in the lead). I understand that it is unsourced, however that is because of its concentration--nearly every word has been carefully worked out among various editors to represent their concerns for inclusion.  This is very much a work in progress.  In particular those who live in other parts of the world--I have corresponded personally with folks in Great Britain, New Zealand and Eastern Europe-- have complained that the &quot;Hippie&quot; article is too America-centric.  The geographical scope of the first paragraph of the lead is a preliminary attempt to answer their concerns, though much more needs to be done.

I'm not sure how to answer your objection about sourcing because forty or more citations (just guessing) would need to be inserted to fully source this paragraph. Pretty awkward. In any case, a specific request for sourcing is usually more appropriate than immediate deletion.  This gives the involved editors time to honor your request.

I understand that you believe that much of the information contained in this paragraph is doubtful.  Personally, I would not have thought to include many of the geographical references (Japan, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Eastern Europe for example) before doing my own research on the subject.  Nevertheless, a lot of thought has gone into this paragraph and I believe it is quite accurate.

For the reasons I have given, I believe the lead as previously written should be reinstated.  It can, of course, be improved and refined--that is happening all the time.   Thanks for participating, now and in the future. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 18:32, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''hippie''' a member of a counterculture that began appearing in the early 1960s, which expressed a moral rejection of the established society. Derived from the word hip, meaning roughly &quot;in the know,&quot; or &quot;aware.&quot; Numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word. One of the most credible involves the beatniks, who abandoned North Beach, San Francisco, to flee commercialism in the early 1960s. Many of them moved to the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, where they were idolized and emulated by the young University of San Francisco students in the neighborhood. The beats (the hip people) started calling these students “hippies,” or younger versions of themselves. Actually, the counterculture seldom called itself hippies; it was the media and straight society who popularized the term. Most often, we called ourselves freaks or heads. Not until later did we begin calling ourselves hippies, and by then we were &quot;aging hippies.&quot; An alternate spelling seldom used by people in the know was “hippy.” (See: freak and head)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCleary's description squares with my own recollections and with other commentary I've read about the movement from people who were there. So how about we revise the original lead along these lines. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 21:09, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi Sunray.  I've read McCleary's book, and I think his particular discussion of the etymology of the word &quot;hippie&quot; deserves inclusion in the &quot;Etymology&quot; section rather than the lead.  I also think McCleary is correct when he says that it was the media and straight people who popularized the term, especially Herb Caen between late 1965 and 1968.  I suppose it depends on what McCleary means by &quot;aging hippies&quot; (the hippie thing did pretty quickly get old for many people!), but I know that after Caen's column popularized the term those of us who were participants started calling each other &quot;hippies,&quot; at first with humor and then with a certain pride in identity.  That began in late 1966.  Although [[Stephen Gaskin]] usually referred to himself as a &quot;beatnik,&quot; he began to embrace the term during his Monday Night Classes, which began in earnest in 1967.  The thousands of people who attended the classes started using it too.  So, I think we need to be more specific than McCleary has been.  I wrote the following, which still needs citation:

:&quot;In popularizing the term, columnist Herb Caen's daily references to hippies mostly expressed fascination and mild amusement rather than disapproval. Following his lead, many participants in the movement accepted the hippie label and used it in a non-pejorative sense. [citation needed]&quot;

What I will need to do to provide a citation is visit a library where microfiche files exist for issues of the San Francisco Chronicle from late 1965-68. I also need to get my hands on a copy of Gaskin's ''Monday Night Class'' to see if that contains appropriate references to the term.  I've initiated a request to be put in touch with Gaskin to see if there might be other published sources to confirm what I wrote. (I notice that on his current Web page he lists his religion as &quot;hippie.&quot;)  I do think it is accurate; just need time to do the work.

In general I think our collaborative effort here at WP will yield a result superior to ''The Hippie Dictionary,'' which occasionally seems less than precise and which lacks sufficient depth.  It's a large topic, as it turns out, and the impact of the hippie ethos on world culture continues to be felt.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 21:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

:''Right on,'' Founders4. I didn't mean to imply that we should copy McCleary's words, and am in complete agreement that they can be improved upon. However, I do think that his version is closer to the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter than the previous lead. No doubt the hippie phenomenon grew out of the interaction between the beats and the increasingly radicalized students. Your approach of checking the ''S.F. Chronicle'' will no doubt give us some sources.  I also think that the ''Monday Night Class'' will shed some light. I'll do some research too.  This could make a real contribution if we get some decent sources. As to &quot;aging hippie,&quot; the term is technically a misnomer as it was widely accepted that the hippie was buried in '67 (I have the pictures to prove it).  So the term is often used with a nudge and a wink. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 00:04, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, I remember &quot;Death of Hippy&quot;! You know what's missing from the article--humor!  Jerry Garcia said it best, I think, when the Dead started to gain some mainstream acceptance.  I'm paraphrasing here, but basically he said, &quot;Hate to disappoint you.  But we're just not that serious about this whole thing.&quot;  Like the yippie attempt to remove the hands from the clock at Grand Central Station in NYC (&quot;The Rape of Time&quot;), we were pretty much playing at it, making it up as we went along.  I wrote a sentence a while back:

:::Hippies did not create a cohesive political or social movement with well-defined leaders and manifestos. Rather the hippie ethos evolved in a complex interplay between leaders and followers as a social manifestation of 1960s zeitgeist.

::Of course it got deleted in the last great purge, which Viriditus initiated on September 18.  The fact is that whether we are talking about Leary, Alpert/Ram Das, Gaskin, Owsley, Chet Helmes or any other list of hippie &quot;leaders,&quot; they all ducked the label.  The &quot;movement&quot; wasn't exactly leaderless, but sometimes the &quot;leaders&quot; led, and sometimes the &quot;followers&quot; did.  All in good fun.  Like children, joyful in the game....[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 02:37, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

== Removal of paragraph referencing hippie action abroad after 1973, Section title ==

:&quot;Outside the United States, hippie culture has remained more visible as a countercultural movement. Especially in Britain, Denmark, New Zealand and Australia, the hippie movement as a distinct social phenomenon continued to develop and thrive. {{Talkfact}}&quot;

Just noticed that you deleted this paragraph, Viriditas, after allowing only a couple of days for editors to provide sourcing.  I initiated a source request from Mombas, who has been instrumental in informing everyone as to the continued vitality of the hippie movement in New Zealand.  And I'm sure we will be hearing from the [[Freetown Christiania|Christiana]] folks in Denmark as well.  There is another fellow in Britain who objected strenuously to an earlier contention (not by me, though I initially supported it) that &quot;1971 was generally considered to be the last year of the hippie era.&quot;

This is related to the many voiced concerns that the &quot;Hippie&quot; article is too America-centric, because others insist that the decline in hippie visibility and influence was far less steep abroad than here in the U.S.  I tend to believe them, especially since the [[Nambassa]] festivals in New Zealand continued through 1981, and some of the late 1970s events were attended by tens of thousands of people.

How about leaving the paragraph in for a while until we see what can be provided in the way of sourcing?[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 20:44, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

:That's interesting, but how does that support the claim that &quot;hippie culture has remained more visible&quot; than the states?

== Don't feed the troll ==

:&quot;For many people, the characterising feature of trolling is the perception of intent to disrupt a community in some way. Inflammatory, sarcastic, disruptive or humorous content is posted, meant to draw other users into engaging the troll in a fruitless confrontation. The greater the reaction from the community the more likely the user is to troll again, as the person develops beliefs that certain actions achieve his/her goal to cause chaos. This gives rise to the often repeated protocol in Internet culture: &quot;Do not feed the trolls.&quot;

Viriditas, you have turned a rather good article (always needing improvement, of course) into an overchewed, regurgitated piece of mush.  You make radical changes on a daily basis, refusing dialogue with other editors. You initiated an RFC request that resulted in the following response:

:&quot;If this summary is correct then my initial guess was pretty near the mark. While verifiable sources always help an article and while it would be good to take down doubtful statements when requesting verification, this particular instance seems to be overzealous. Rather than delete material that is probably true, please tag it with a request for citation and/or discuss it on the talk page and give a reasonable time frame for verification before deleting. To my eyes the article seems to have been pretty much on target. Harmonious editing means respecting existing consensus unless there's real reason to believe the article is distorted in some way. Regards, Durova 05:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)&quot;

Apparently you choose to ignore this response.  For the other editors of this article you have turned an inspiring, creative effort into an unpleasant, full-time exercise in confrontation.  Since there is no way to satisfy your appetite, I choose to stop feeding you.  To quote another editor who left the project a few days ago, please feel free &quot;to flail about by yourself&quot; for a while. Goodbye. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 17:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

== Amazingly verbose introduction ==

I want to thank the person who offered a link to [[WP:1SP]], the guide to writing better Wiki articles. Just as I suspected, the advice there is to '''keep the Introduction short.''' It suggests one or two paragraphs. The current Intro rambles all over the place and brings in information that is better left to the main part of the piece. I offered a comprehensive way to improve the Intro (move entire sentences and emphases to the rubrics below), but it was immediately reverted.

You can see how improved the Intro is in my version by going to http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;oldid=77563377.

This article is really not important enough for me to continue playing, so I am picking up my marbles and leaving.

I can only suggest that your efforts be turned to (1) paring down the Intro to one or two opening grafs and (2) deleting any statements (within the entire article) that are not immediately sourced within the same paragraph. I will return in a month or two to see if you have made any progress. And I wish you all good luck in developing an article that the average middle-school student (in any country in the world) can easily comprehend.

== A suggestion to Viriditas re: conflict ==

I just joined Wikipedia and came to see the hippy article.  I have read most of the recent additions to this talk page, and one thing stands out -  quite a number of different people are frustrated with you, Viriditas. 

Yet you seem unable to understand their frustration, and you take no responsibility for it. You remind me of a guy  from NYC I once dated  - talented and brilliant, but unable to empathize with others.  In many instances this lack of empathy meant he didn't even hear what they were saying.  And he couldn't seem to escape being in conflict with those around him despite the fact that he was actually a nice guy.

I don't care to enter into the details of this discussion.  But if you will just assume that you might - just might - bear some responsibility; if you make a concerted effort to hear,  and relay your new found empathy to others so they can feel heard; if you occasionally concede a point and offer thanks for a correction; if you congratulate others for their fine contributions (they can't all be faulty or worthless) - you may just find that others react differently to you.  Apologies are nice too.

==Removed marijuana paragraph==
Removed the following, as it does not make a connection with [[Hippie]] whatsoever.  I'd support its inclusion once rewritten to establish the connection (I'm not saying there isn't one) between hippies and pot, please. We have info for what percent of college students smoked pot, more useful would be what percentage of hippies smoked pot and/or what percentage of college students were hippies.

::Thank you, Pedant for demonstrating exactly what ''disruptive'' editing looks like and how it acts. A five-second google search would have informed you that the author, Terry H. Anderson, is Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M University, who has written and published extensively about hippies.  The section you removed is about young kids who were members of the hippie movement, and it was written in that context.  Please don't let an expert historian who specializes in hippie culture get in the way of any further disruption.  Although I didn't write the Kerouac section, it is common knowledge and has been widely published as well.  By all means, continue with your disruptive editing so that others can see what it truly looks like, and possibly learn from your example.   &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 08:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

The Kerouac info should be cited, but is considered to be common knowledge; the cannabis stats show an increase in drug use during the 1960s, and were compiled by a historian for an article/book about hippies and the 1960s.  Almost every definition of hippies describes them as smoking marijuana openly, directly reflecting the beat culture before it, which Keroauc popularized.  The evolution from beat to hip and the connection between the two is not even debatable.  The rise of marijuana use is merely illustrative.

I'm not at all doubting the widespread use of cannabis among hippies, I am questioning the relevance of stating that it appeared in Keroauc's book, and then following with statistics about a group other than the subject group of the article.

If I was George, I doubt that I would want to get involved in any controversy, so I would probably deny it as well.  Some users might even feel intimidated by Founders. It is my opinion that George stopped editing this page due to Founder's ownership behavior.  Perhaps Founders will ask George why he no longer edits this page, but I think George has made it clear that he has no interest in this dispute.

The current New Left section, to paraphrase Pedant, has no connection with the Hippie article, and should summarize the most relevant points from the main.  Founders has not provided page numbers for verification, nor has he supported his claim with a quote of the supporting passage.  The external link provided does not mention anything about hippies.

In the interim, I've added  the protest image to [[New_Left#New_Left_in_the_United_States]] until we can create a section entitled, &quot;Cultural dissent&quot; (or something similar) that addresses the actual role of hippies in the political movement.  Remember, they are treated as a distinct group from the two other dissenting groups, namely the [[New Left]], and the [[civil rights movement]].  Those three distinct groups make up the core of the counterculture of the 1960s. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 06:27, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

I do agree that the dissent needs to be discussed, and that it needs to be in the lead, but in the lead it should (since as you say the lead 'needs' to be smaller) focus on dissent from hippies.  The new left and civil rights connections could quite well be introduced somewhere else.  I knew if we could get some discussion going that we might find an intersection between our ideas.  Maybe if the discussion were less antagonistic and condescending, respectively, we might create an atmosphere in which other editors besides ourselves might feel welcome.

====Charles Manson====
{{main|Charles Manson}}

Charles Manson was a hard-core, institutionalized criminal who had been released from prison just in time for San Francisco's Summer of Love.  With his long hair and the ability to charm a crowd with his [[guitar]] playing, his singing, and his rhetoric, Manson exhibited many of the outward manifestations of hippie identity.  Yet Manson hardly exemplified the hippie ideals of peace, love, compassion and human fellowship; through twisted logic and psychological manipulation, he inspired his followers to commit murder.

Manson's highly publicized 1970 trial and subsequent conviction in January 1971 irrevocably tarnished the hippie image in the eyes of the American public. Other factors--for instance, the arrival of hard drugs and their associated dependency--also contributed to the decline.

==Roots removed from lead==

::Looking at Hirsch's definition, it appears entirely accurate.  Hippies were members of a movement of cultural protest.  This movement, or counterculture, was a protest movement by American youth, along with two other movements, the New Left and the civil rights movement.  Placing hippies in this historical context is essential to understanding the origin of the hippies as well as their philosophy. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 12:19, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

::Just a comment, but NPOV has nothing to do with relevance. Stop citing policy at me, I am completely familiar with ALL wikipedia policies... [[WP:NPOV]] means wikipedia doesn't take a stand on the issue of whether he was a hippie or not, if there are conflicting sources.  Where does Paul Krassner state that Charles Manson is a hippie?  And if he was a hippie, what makes Charles Manson relevant to an article on hippies? What is the connection to the rest of the article?  There were thousands of hippie notables, (or people who were said in some media to be hippies) do you propose the insertion of unrelated text about each one of them?  The text about Manson doesn't connect to the rest of the article.  If you are insistent about adding mention of Charels Manson, I am equally insistent about the text having some relevance to the article: '''it needs to actually make the article a better article''' or it doesn't belong.

Thanks.  Putting aside NPOV for a moment, Paul Krassner states that Charles Manson was ''not'' a hippie in an article he wrote for ''High Times'', later expanded and included in Russ Kick's ''Everything You Know is Wrong''. Charles Manson is relevant to an article on hippies due to the reasons explained by the [[Thomson Gale]] citation, as well as the explanation Founders4 has laid out above, so I won't repeat them here.  The relationship between the media, the Hippies, and Manson have already been explained in that cite: &quot;Mainstream Americans who had once looked on these countercultural movements as fairly benign began to see in them a real threat to the social order...the media attention on the case seemed to confirm the worst fears of those who believed that the hippie lifestyle of drugs and sex could easily lead to crime.&quot;  The Manson incident, whether media-inspired or not, was one factor that led to the decline of the hippie movement. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 02:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Bugliosi admits that although the Manson murders &quot;may have hastened&quot; the end of the hippie era, the era was already in decline (according to him).  More importantly, Bugliosi makes it very clear that hippies &quot;disavowed Manson, stating that what he espoused...violence, was antithetical to their beliefs.&quot;  There are many other opinions, however, with some elements of the counterculture embracing Manson, not to mention Manson's history in the Haight, as the &quot;gardener&quot; who &quot;tends the flower children&quot;.

== A Question About &quot;Nonpolitical&quot; ==

How can a group be &quot;nonpolitical&quot; and simultaneously seek &quot;to champion and implement change by opposing the Vietnam war&quot; and &quot;embrace the civil rights movement&quot;? 

It seems that almost any perspective can be supported by a &quot;hippie&quot; quote from somewhere.  A while back the lead of this article said that &quot;the hippie movement began during the late 1960s.&quot; That was nonsense too, yet the sentence sported a perfectly legitimate quote to support it.

I've commented on this before, quoting Oracle founder Allen Cohen's essay, &quot;A New Look at the Summer of Love&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.be-in.com/history/allen-cohen/&lt;/ref&gt;:

:There were two aspects to the experience of the 60s: the resistance to the war, and the &quot;psychedelic experience&quot;, personified as political activists and hippies. For the most part these two vectors overlapped in the same individuals, so that many of those who actively resisted the Vietnam war had used LSD and smoked marijuana. As a society we have tried to understand the sixties mostly as political resistance to the war, but have mostly ignored and denied the changes in values and culture brought about by &quot;psychedelic experiences&quot;. 

What has been consistently ignored is Cohen's clause, &quot;For the most part these two vectors overlapped in the same individuals...&quot;  And the lead has become increasingly simplistic, using selective quotes to present the idea that the counterculture was comprised of three separate, self-identified groups.  First all reference was deleted to hippie outrage at the Vietnam War as a fulfillment of Eisenhower's &quot;Farewell Address&quot; warning against the &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot;  Then Altman's photo was deleted, which showed plenty of hippies among a crowd of anti-war demonstrators in San Francisco circa 1970.  Now hippies have become quite &quot;nonpolitical.&quot;

Yet one definition of &quot;political&quot; is:

:Of or relating to one's views about social relationships involving authority or power&quot;

By this definition, ALL hippies were intensely political.

Then there is a somewhat narrower definition of &quot;political&quot;: 

:Relating to the government or public affairs of a country.

By this definition, MOST hippies were intensely political, particularly with respect to one particular &quot;public affair&quot; of the United States of America--the Vietnam War.

Then there is the narrowest defintion of &quot;political&quot;:

:Of, relating to, involving, or involved in politics and especially party politics.

Even according to this definition, SOME hippies were political.  How else to explain the large hippie presence at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago?

But feel free.  Go ahead.  Pursue the &quot;non-political&quot; thing until the group you are describing becomes completely unrecognizable, especially to those who comprised it. 

It does make Wikipedia look bad though.  Comments anyone?[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 05:04, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
:Founders4, could you please keep your comments brief and to the point?  I have requested this of you for some time with no results.  I can address your points, but your essay-length responses do not help.  Please refactor your comment above for brevity.  As it stands, citing reliable sources does not harm Wikipedia in any way.  From the source in question:  &quot;...hippies sympathized with the political positions of their fellow dissenters yet rarely used politics as a means of expressing their rejection [of] mainstream values. Politics, they claimed, was the game played by conventional adults, and they wanted no part of elections, lobbying, protests, and other common ways to bring about social change. In fact, they wanted no part of what they called &quot;establishment&quot; culture at all, believing that permanent legal and civil organizations were too concerned with material goods, too competitive, and too dominated by anxiety and corruption. Hippies wanted a new society based on peace, love, and pleasure. Members of the hippie counter-culture expressed their dissent through personal expression...&quot; &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:05, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

Prefer not to be lectured.  Points made as briefly as possible.  Choose not to refactor. [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 16:20, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
:::With all due respect, repeated requests for brevity over many weeks is not &quot;lecturing&quot;.  Every source I've found describes the hippie subgroup as nonpolitical.  Even hippies who were part of the diverse antiwar movement in 1967 offered nonpolitical solutions.  Hippies are seen as cultural, not political radicals, who rejected middle-class values and advocated dropping out of society like the Beats.  A smal vocal minority wanted to reject the entire establishment, and proposed the creation of a new one.  In this regard, the 1968 &quot;Declaration of Cultural Evolution&quot; should be discussed in the article.  One could compare the cultural dissent of the hippies, who preferred to work ''outside'' the system  with the political dissent of say, the 1966 SNCC position paper on Vietnam, which explicitly frames its ''political'' dissent within the establishment, encouraging &quot;those Americans who prefer to use their energy in building democratic forms within the country.&quot; &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 18:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

==Hoffman quote==
An anonymous user has reinserted an alleged Abbie Hoffman quotation from a student film, cherry-picked to serve as a counterpoint to the ''Time'' quote about hippies.  I spent an hour watching the film yesterday, and unless we can get a transcript to resolve the ambiguities, I would ask that the anon editor please stop manipulating the quote to say what he wants it to say.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 18:54, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe you weren't paying close attention to the film then - watch it again!.  Hoffman (it sure isn't anyone else) clearly is heard to say &quot;We're all hippies&quot;, as well as &quot;We're not Yippies. There are no 'Yippies'.  Yippie! is just a slogan, you know, like &quot;Yippie!&quot; (the bumper sticker)  Your edit stating that the context is unclear whether he is talking about hippies or &quot;yippies&quot;, is therefore inaccurate.  Also I did not &quot;reinsert&quot; the quote, I merely moved it back out of the footnotes where you have tried to hide it.  Evidently you consider corporate media like Time to be more of an authority on Hippie culture, than straight from the horses' mouths.  Who is &quot;manipulating&quot;? [[User:71.253.146.14|71.253.146.14]] 02:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
:::Hi, and thanks for your reply.  Some questions: how do you know Abbie Hoffman is the one speaking?  I'm assuming you think it's him based on previous footage.  That's not a problem, but without a transcript, there are several issues with your selective quoting.  You claim that Hoffman was describing the hippie movement, but I didn't get that from the film, and I played the audio back several times.  When we quote on Wikipedia, we have to be certain who the source is, and make sure to preserve the context.  Your quote distorted the context, perhaps unintentionally, as you confused the reader by omitting the part about a money-free society, which completely changes the meaning of &quot;free&quot; as it is used.  I cannot deny that this quote is relevant, but until we can quote accurately and in context, I must ask you to be more rigorous in editing the article.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 03:19, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

If you really want to be that pedantic about what Hoffman thought about the subject, then why don't you read or quote from his own work? Try ''Woodstock Nation'' or ''Revolution for the Hell of It.'' This whole article (and its discussion) freaks me out. Hell, I have a Master's in 20th Century American history, but the idea of reducing my youth (with its idealism, anger, disillusionment, fear, etc.) to a dry academic exercise is grotesque to say the least. It reminds me of those wierd books (released back in those days) by establishment publishers about &quot;the new hippie culture&quot; complete with glosseries. We thought they were hilarious.

Many of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] (later renamed San Francisco State University) who had &quot;dropped out&quot; after they started taking [[psychedelic drugs]] and began living communally in the large, inexpensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] apartments in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.  Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June, 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight. This constituted the original core of the hippie movement, comprised of people with historical roots and the beginnings of a political and social analysis.  A second wave, larger, younger and without an analysis and commitment that could sustain their rebellion, but nevertheless affixed with the same appellation - hippie - flooded major cities around the world in response to the publicity that followed the world's first &quot;Human Be-in&quot; or &quot;Gathering of the Tribes&quot;.  Knowing this basic distinction between these two sociological demographics is essential for understanding the further history of the movement.  For example, it is likely that it was mostly the second wave that &quot;copped out&quot; and became yuppies. Many or most of the originators are probably still among us, scattered across the country and the world, having had and continuing to have a profound influence in a thousand different ways on mainstream society and culture. &lt;ref name=Tompkins1&gt;Tompkins, 2001, Vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:59, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

Sorry if I got yer goat. Maybe &quot;boneheaded&quot; was a little too strong for your sensibilities (is that a wierd statement considering the subject under consideration?) I guess that I have just been illuminated (and how rarely that does occur in one's lifetime) about the true nature of history as a consensual illusion of what the past was like (shades of Michel Foucalt). Quantatative analysis provides truth? You should discuss the matter with Mr. McNamara, he understands all about quantatative analysis. Just finished Mark Moyar's Triumph Forsaken, its all the rage in the &quot;new revisionism&quot; of our Southeast Asian adventure. Its subject is what a great guy Ngo Dinh Diem really was and that if we hadn't supported his assassination you know what, we would have won. Can you imagine? If this is happening now in a historical discussion of Vietnam and an article on the hip folks of yesteryear, can you imagine what they are going to do with Iraq? Not really a contribution to yer article, just an observation.[[User:RM Gillespie|RM Gillespie]] 20:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
::Grunt, grunt.  Sorry, you don't speak bonehead so please permit me to  translate from my native neanderthal tongue.  You made your point the first time around, and the second time I distinctly heard the sound of a dead horse being beaten by a magnificent, battle-hardened club of authority.  Why you find the cliché of history being written by the winners, novel in some way, escapes me, but if you would care to apply your expertise to the topic of this article, commenting critically and pointing out the gaps (chasms really) in the fragmented history of the hippies, and offering suggestions on how to improve it, that would be wonderful, but I see you have set down the battle club only to start grinding the axe head.

Unknowingly (I think), you have hit the proverbial nail directly on the head. It is not that history is being written by the winners (although I thought we lost the Vietnam Conflict). It is that history is being re-written to suit prevailing taste, trends, socio/political climate etc. That is direct link to the discussion of your article. But, nuff said, you win. History is written by the winners. Let the culture wars cease. Victory has been declared by authority. Last comment. Good Luck to you and God help us all.[[User:RM Gillespie|RM Gillespie]] 14:31, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

== Pretentious Hippies. ==

Okay, so I see my paragraph on 'Holier Than Thou Hippies' was removed.  Fair enough.  However, it wasn't a joke or vandalisation,  these people ARE a sub group of hippies and in the UK there are millions of them, they are a shame to the word Hippie and I feel there is a need for this to be included.   Am I right in thinking this is open for anyone to edit?  If not, accept my apologies and I will go elsewhere.

== Philosophy/ethos issues ==

I've added pov and verify section tags as Founders4 removed my cite request.  Controversial claims must be attributed.  Heath and Potter appear to dispute what Founders4 has written, and the content needs to be verified and the sources checked for reliability. Sources like Kueshana and the Stelle Group might not be considered reliable, so we need to be very clear about who is saying what, attributing individual claims to individual authors, and refraining from  generalizing in matters where there is more than one POV, or where one source might not be as credible as another.  Founders4, please help clear up this ongoing problem.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 20:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

:First you asked for citations, which I provided.  Then you accused me of falsifying said citations, a charge that you neither substantiated nor retracted. You also accused me of &quot;refusing&quot; to provide page numbers, even though I promised to do so as time allowed.  Those page numbers have been added, on an ongoing basis, over the past few weeks, yet you still accuse me (in your recent edit summary) of &quot;refus(ing) to attribute.&quot;  The only ongoing problem is you, sir.

::Getting straight to the point: Does the quote from Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalogue refer to a &quot;hippie ethos&quot; or are those your words?  Which author states that hippies see themselves as &quot;conscious creators&quot;?  This needs attribution. Which author claims that hippies avoided being reduced to mere consumers, as this contradicts Heath and Potter, who seem to argue that hippies were consumers.  Again, that needs attribution. There's no argument that the movement went mainstream, but which author writes that &quot;those who understood the task of conscious creation moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit&quot;?  We need to be able to verify these claims, know who is making them, and determine the reliability of the sources.  I've been asking you of this for months.

Another editor submitted this section on August 5, 2006 as:

:&quot;This list, however, although perhaps accurate, largely trivializes, simplifies and obscures the true characteristics of what hippies were really all about. It essentially itemizes effects, rather than causes, and deflects attention from the spiritual, philosophical, social and pollitical basis of hippy beliefs to outward manifestations of those beliefs.

:&quot;Perhaps the best summation of what hippy was really all about came from Stewart Brand's introduction to the first edition of the Whole Earth Catalogue:

::'We are as gods and might as well get used to it. So far, remotely done power and glory--as via government, big business, formal education, church--has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing--power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.'

:&quot;Perhaps the principal threat that the exploding hippy movement posed to mainstream, vested-interest, world culture was their rejection of materialism and it's modern exploiter, consumerism.&quot;

I refined this editor's submission, retaining the Stewart Brand quote and referring to it as a &quot;summation&quot; of the &quot;hippie ethos&quot; rather than a &quot;summation&quot; of &quot;what hippy was really all about.&quot;  Then yesterday you condensed it further, substituting the word &quot;description&quot; for &quot;summation.&quot;  

''The Ultimate Frontier'' was originally published by The Stelle Group.  It was read widely from 1963 on and had a profound impact on the thinking and development of hippie philosophy.  Other books also influenced this thinking, among them a small book called ''It Works,'' which also discusses conscious creation.  The discussions of conscious creation, or &quot;preciptation,&quot; that appear in ''The Ultimate Frontier'' are explicitly called out in the attributions--read them.  ''The Ultimate Frontier'' was published by The Stelle Group from 1963 through the mid-1980's.  Since then it has been published by the Adelphi Organization.  Who published this book is not relevant to its undeniable impact on hippie philosophy.

Read the sources I have provided.  Where I am quoting, I use quotation marks.  Otherwise I am using my own words to paraphrase what many others (Stewart Brand, Alicia Bay Laurel, Yablonsky, et al) have written. 

I do not intend to waste any more of my time with these exercises. Of course I can provide more references.  But I think you will simply do what you want with the article, regardless of any attribution I provide.  It is editors like you who cause people to leave Wikipedia in disgust.   Another word for your endless provocation is &quot;TROLLING.&quot;    You create a poisonous miasma that spreads over the entire article, and I see no point in continuing to feed you.  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 23:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
::If you make any more [[WP:NPA|personal attacks]], I will remove them on sight.  Getting back to the issue, with special attention paid to ''brevity'', the answer to my questions from your previous reply seem to be the following: The quote regarding Brand's &quot;hippie ethos&quot; is the opinion of another editor that you incorporated into the article and ''does not'' reflect the source in question.  In other words, it is original research.  In regards to my questions about ''The Ultimate Frontier'', I'm afraid you are misinformed concerning the relevance of reliable sources, and if you can't attribute these claims to the author appropriately, or at the very least provide information about the content in question, then we have a problem regarding what you claim to be your &quot;own words to paraphrase what many others...have written.&quot;  You have confirmed that Brand did not refer to the quote in question as a summation of the hippie ethos.  But, you have still not confirmed or attributed who states that hippies see themselves as &quot;conscious creators&quot;, who claims that hippies avoided being reduced to mere consumers (apparently contradicted by Heath, Potter, 2004) and who claimed that hippies &quot;understood the task of conscious creation moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit&quot;.  Since you refuse to do this, I will remove the section and place it here.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:15, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

What I am attacking is your practice of non-collaborative editing and your habit of provacation.  Specifically, you escalate even small disagreements, and you use terms that you know will alienate others.  Every editor who had been participating in this article has left in disgust since your arrival.  Some have been reduced, out of frustration and anger at your methods, into making personal attacks.  I have not done that, and by referring to my complaints as &quot;personal attacks&quot; you confirm the validity of my observations.

Brand did not refer to the quote in question as a summation of the hippie ethos; he was a quintessential member of the hippie tribe (Merry Prankster, co-sponsor of the Trips Festival, and so on) and he would never have been so presumptuous as to pretend to be able to do that.  His quote has merit because he has repeatedly been able to simply and eloquently express the spirit of complicated things.  He does that to this day with his Long Now organization.  The inclusion of &quot;perhaps&quot; qualified the lead-in for inclusion of his quoted statement.  Another way to include it would be to write:  Stewart Brand said: .....&quot;                             &quot;

In my opinion your demands for sourcing are too literal and amount to Wikilawyering.  This time I AM accusing you of that!  If you read the referenced pieces, especially ''Monday Night Class'', you will see quite easily that what I wrote is amply supported.  You will have to abandon, though, a mindset that I suspect is too narrow to allow understanding of the topic at hand.  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 03:27, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
:Please keep your comments brief and to the point, avoid discussing and speculating about other editors, and work towards a negotiated agreement.  Yes, I agree, the article needs more information about Brand, and the two references that I recently added (Markoff and Turner) cover this issue quite well.  I'm currently reading Markoff and glancing at Turner,but admittedly spending more time with Perry's book at the moment.  Instead of telling me to read something, simply cite it to make your point, and ''attribute'' appropriately.  If the &quot;conscious creation&quot; stuff is notable in relation to hippies, you should be able to cite it as such. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 06:04, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

My comments are as brief as your own.  ''Monday Night Class'' is a stream-of-consciousness kind of work, as were the classes themselves.  It must be  referenced ''in toto'', not in the &quot;sound bite&quot; kind of way that you want.  With ''The Ultimate Frontier'' I spent an entire day rereading the relevant sections and citing the appropriate page numbers, only to have you disdain the source altogether. What about the other sources--the essays by Alicia Bay Laurel and Stewart Brand...can you not see that they support what I wrote?  To date I have not seen you concede a single point made by me or any other editor, no matter how well-documented, and I will waste no more of my time.  Truly this has become an exercise in &quot;survival of the most obnoxious.&quot;  You win. (Now THAT is a personal attack!)  [[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 07:42, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
::Thanks for the brief comment; it really does make discussion easier.  Ok, what are you referring to specifically with Gaskin?  All you have to do is attribute a statement about hippie ethos/philosophy to him; same with Brand and Laurel.  Can you add the content that you are talking about, here?  As for Kueshana, the book was written prior to the hippie movement, but if it was as influential as you claim, there should be reliable, secondary sources that make that claim, in the same way that one can find sources claiming ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' influenced the hippies. Do you see the difference? As for concessions, I prefer to view them as compromises, of which I've made many, including acecepting Pedant's removal of cannabis statistics that I added (which were made in reference to hippies by an academic) however, Pedant convinced me of the need for skepticism in this case. You, on the other hand, convinced me that it wasn't necessary to describe the hippies as non-political in the lead, and you also made me realize that without context, it could confuse people. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 08:53, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

Every word of what I wrote was chosen with care to briefly summarize key elements of the hippie ethos/philosophy.  Given this, according to your rules, each clause would require attribution, since I am referencing many authors and sources rather than a single source.

::&quot;At their highest point of awareness, hippies recognized themselves as conscious creators. What they created during the 1960s was an attempt to avoid induction into a pre-packaged, materialistic culture where they would be reduced to being mere consumers.  As the outward manifestations of hippie culture were incorporated into the mainstream package, those who understood the task of conscious creation moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit.&quot;

&quot;At their highest point of awareness...&quot;  refers to the fact that not all hippies were equally aware.  Yablonsky in particular refers to this fact in his analysis of the hippie &quot;class system,&quot; where philosophers and teachers occupied the highest rung.

...&quot;hippies recognized themselves as conscious creators...&quot; refers to the whole body of Gaskin's teachings, which were informed by his familiarity with the mechanics of mental precipitation (as discussed in Kueshana's widely read ''The Ultimate Frontier'' and other popular works) as well as his own experiences. You asked for a specific quote from Gaskin's ''Monday Night Class'' that supports &quot;hippies recognized themselves as conscious creators&quot;:

:&quot;We all start with undifferentiated energy, and then we hold an idea of our self, and if we lose that idea of our self we start to die.  That's what happens to people, they lose their idea of themselves, and they don't create themselves good enough to make it anymore.  ''We're each one creating our own self and our whole universe. You are all God creating your own universe.''  Saying things like that is like throwing a rock out somewhere listening for an echo.  It really is, because like when I say that ''all you are all gods creating your own universe then there's implications that should arise in your mind, like this is the universe that you're creating right now...see.  Here we are.  This is your creation...each one of you.  Each one of you creates all this.''&quot; (emphasis added)

&quot;What they created during the 1960's was an attempt to avoid induction into a pre-packaged materialist culture...&quot; refers to what hippies created (alternate lifestyles, attitudes, communes, and so on) as an ''attempt'' to avoid induction (just as one might be inducted into the military) into mid-twentieth century educational systems, systems of production, commercial institutions and cultural life--all of which gauged success primarily in material terms. 

:&quot;It's just a large machine and you don't know who runs the machine or what.  It's just there.  It is just cutting out more people from the same machine.  Even the cream of society, they become machines, you know.  The way I look at it is that they treat human beings as puppets.  They are not on their own.  I don't know; it is too indifferent, you know.  You're not going to learn anything by punching your clock every day when you go to work and then punching out again when you go home. And you know, you never get any good feeling about it because there is nothing there.  Bob Dylan wrote a song called &quot;Masters of War&quot; that kind of says it for me about this big machine called Society.&quot; (Yablonsky interview with 16-year-old hippie, circa 1968)

Did hippies succeed in their attempt to avoid induction into this society.  No, not quite.  Eventually we had to participate in some fashion.  But it was a valiant attempt, and many of us did manage to carve out niches that were consonant with our individual ideals.  As Yablonsky says:

:&quot;This enormous involvement (editor's note:  Yablonsky has just commented on the extensive mass media coverage, nearly universal emulation by youth of  hippie ways, and so on) with a movement that has directly involved only a small percentage of the total population may reveal something fundamental about the nerve-end it strikes in American society.  The hippies, at least in their basic idealized form stand for love, compassion, sexual freedom and the right to do 'one's thing,' whatever it may be.&quot;

Yablonsky even comments at one point that if hippies hadn't come along to remind Americans of their core values, someone would have had to invent them.

&quot;...induction into a pre-packaged materialist culture where they would be reduced to being mere consumers.&quot;  The word &quot;mere&quot; is especially important here.  Of course hippies were consumers; one must consume to live.  And as one matures, marries, has children and pursues various life endeavors, the rate of consumption increases.  But if life is reduced ''merely'' to consumption, ''merely'' to the process of living in the material world, it becomes meaningless--THAT was the thrust of hippie culture: &quot;Do what you must to live, but don't get distracted by process.&quot; I haven't read what Heath and Potter have to say in ''Nation of Rebels:  How Counterculture Became Consumer Culture''; I am sure that some hippies did get &quot;distracted by process&quot; and fail to fully actualize their philosophy.  But in her short essay, &quot;What Did Hippies Want,&quot; Alicia Bay Laurel defines much of hippie INTENT, which is to say much of their PHILOSOPHY (or their ETHOS).

&quot;As the outward manifestations of hippie culture were incorporated into the mainstream package, those who understood the task of conscious creation moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit.&quot;  Brand's essay, &quot;We Owe It All to the Hippies&quot; speaks to this and specifically says &quot;the counterculture's scorn for centralized authority provided the philosophical foundations of not only the leaderless Internet but also the entire personal-computer revolution.&quot;  That IS &quot;staying one step ahead.&quot;

I will close with one final Gaskin quote, also from ''Monday Night Class.''  I include  this because I find it quite striking that you never copped to the value of Pedant's contributions before he went screaming into the darkness.  

:&quot;If you're talking to straight people and they won't cop, what do you do?  You know if you're talking to square people and and you try to tell 'em about a game, and they aren't interested at all, right? In most square folks' ground rules, it's considered impolite to notice that your conversational partner is neurotic.  And what you do about that's another thing.  Jesus when he was giving instructions to the apostles, told 'em when you go into a house, feel the house, and let your peace descend on the house, and if the house accepts your peace then you're cool.  You stay there. ''But if the house rejects your peace go forth from that house and go forth from that town and shake the dust from your feet.  Because there's a whole lot of folks aching to know.  Don't bother arguing with somebody that doesn't want to know.  There's a lot of folks that really want to know real bad. There's folks just goin' around askin'.  To not cast your pearls before swine means don't cheapen the truth by fighting over it.'' (emphasis added)

Well, you have tempted me to invest too much of my day (and way too much of my heart) in this discussion, much as the scorpion tempted the frog (http://allaboutfrogs.org/stories/scorpion.html), and just as the frog lived to regret it, I am sure I will also.

:Thanks for taking the time and effort to flesh out that section.  This appears to be a synthesis of ideas, which unfortunately is covered by [[WP:NOR]].  Take a moment to read the policy.  It will help you formulate a new strategy for using this material in the article: I am not working against you, I am trying to help.  I know, for instance, that most of the Brand material is salvagable, and will make it into the article due to the high number of good, reliable secondary sources.  There are still major problems with your use of Gaskin, and Kueshana is problematic: where does this relate to hippies in the secondary sources?  Find reliable secondary sources and cite them; That's all you have to do.  Synthesis is not allowed ''unless'' it is sourced in that manner.  Read the policy.  You mentioned Laurel, but did you quote her?  You quoted Yablonsky and, I don't see a problem with using it as long as it's Yablonsky and ''not'' a synthesis.  I now understand the connection between Gaskin and Kueshana, but what about hippies?  Keep in mind, we cannot interpret primary sources. I think we can resolve this.  Brand must be included at some point and in some way, as cited by reliable sources, so you can cross that off the list. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 23:10, 23 October 2006 (UTC) 

I am aware of the policy.  I am also aware that when the facts themselves can be verified as accurate, the synthesis policy is widely ignored.  In fact I have seldom read a Wikipedia article that did not consist in large part of syntheses of ideas that are not attributable to reliable secondary sources.  This unusual presentation of ideas is, in large part, what attracts me to Wikipedia and makes it interesting.  If I want safe, middle-of-the road stuff, I go to Britannica.

Nevertheless, you are correct and I can help you eliminate those sections that are obviously synthesized--including, but not limited to, those I have written.   I hope you are serious about wanting strictly to follow the anti-synthesis rule.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

When I referred to an &quot;anti-synthesis&quot; rule, I meant the part where it says, &quot;In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published in Wikipedia.&quot;  For the purposes of our discussion, I'll refer to this as the &quot;precise analysis&quot; rule.  

Of course one can argue about just how &quot;precise&quot; the match must be. I suspect you would be more a stickler than I would.  My observation is that violation of this rule is frequently &quot;tolerated but not condoned&quot; in Wikipedia.  And I think that is all to the good, as I do not believe consistency is a virtue. 

With respect to [[WP:POINT]], I admit there was an element of this in my motivation, though I did discipline myself to addressing aspects of the article that I believe violate the &quot;precise analysis&quot; rule.  Feel free to put back those sections that you believe do not deserve the &quot;original research&quot; label.  Myself, I don't quite see why you choose to draw the line where you do.  Also I am not especially offended by &quot;original research,&quot; if it's well done (unlike the &quot;Too shallow, too deep&quot; paragraph) and not too wacky.

I was a bit surprised that you wrote, &quot;I hope that now you have taken the time to remove it, you will also attempt to verify it.&quot;  Have you ever made a practice of this?

I do appreciate the somewhat different tone you have taken in these last two communications.  What this exchange has clarified for me is that our styles are simply incompatible.

===Removed philosophy/ethos section until attribution is provided===
A description of the hippie ethos appeared in the first edition (Fall, 1968) of [[Stewart Brand]]'s [[Whole Earth Catalogue]]:

:&quot;We are as gods and might as well get used to it. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart Brand appears to echo [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s &quot;Thou art God&quot; theme from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; So far, remotely done power and glory--as via government, big business, formal education, church--has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing--power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested...”

At their highest point of awareness, hippies recognized themselves as conscious creators. What they created during the 1960s was an attempt to avoid induction into a pre-packaged, materialistic culture where they would be reduced to being mere consumers.  As the outward manifestations of hippie culture were incorporated into the mainstream package, those who understood the task of conscious creation moved on, staying one step ahead of unending attempts to subsume their lives and their spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskin, 1970, N. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kueshana, 1963, pp. 26-28, 107, 121-22, 159-60, 163, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

== German back-to-nature movement. ==

:These authors believed modern, material desires led to an imbalance in the relationship between humanity and the natural world, resulting in spiritual and physical maladies.  (Removed--statement too general, thus inaccurate.)

:The movement embraced many lifestyles, including [[vegetarianism]], [[fasting]], [[raw food diet]]s, [[nudism]], [[organic farming]], and  [[communal living]]. (Needs attribution)

I believe this was in reference to the German Hippie movement at the end of the 1900s.  For this you can refer to: Children of the Sun, by Gordon Kennedy.  I would also like to see the statement about the European movement of the 18th &amp; 19 centuries reincluded. [[User:Skipstone|Skipstone]] 16:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

== Waning of the hippie movement ==

:After [[1971]] the hippie movement gradually became less visible as a distinct social phenomenon. No longer the focus of urban mainstream media attention,  Hippies moved to rural locations to pursue [[simple living]].  The conclusion of U.S. involvement in [[Vietnam]] after the 1973 peace accords meant that many hippies felt less compelled to engage politically. {{Talkfact}}  
:Many Americans who had once accepted the &quot;hippie&quot; label chose to adopt more conventional outer personae, while holding fast to the timeless ideals that had fuelled the hippie movement from its beginnings. 

The above sections are unsourced.  Also, there is a confusion in the second sentence, which implies that hippies moved to rural locations because they were no longer the focus of urban mainstream media attention--suspect many hippies decided to move to rural locations, and in those rural locations they were no longer the focus of urban mainstream media attention.  No reliable secondary source is offered that would allow attribution of the last sentence.[[User:Founders4|Founders4]] 08:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Sexual attitudes ==

:Hippie tolerance fell short of full inclusiveness; many hippies were not particularly comfortable with homosexuality when it came to communal living arrangements. 

:In fact, hippie domestic life seemed largely to default to traditional gender roles, with women doing most of the work&amp;mdash; cooking, cleaning, child care, and so on&amp;mdash;while the men engaged in creative, artistic pursuits. Images of women in hippie art abound, generally as innocents, goddesses or muses. Most hippie entrepreneurs, philosophers, commune founders and leaders, writers and artists were men.  A notable exception was [[Lenore Kandel]], whose ''Love Book'' got her busted for pornography in [[1967]]. 

:Traditional gender roles gradually changed as hippie culture embraced modern [[feminism]] and egalitarian principles. In 1970, [[Germaine Greer]], [[Australian]] feminist and active member of the hippie movement, published ''The Female Eunuch'', in which she expounded on [[free love]], [[sexual liberation]] and the nonsensical nature of women's bras; hippie women were among the first to remove theirs.

== Too idealistic, too shallow? ==

:Hippies were simultaneously criticised for being both 'too idealist' and 'too shallow'.  The reason in part is that the early hippies wanted society to become more idealistic, but as hippie style began to enter the [[mainstream]], the very elements hippies were rebelling against became attracted to superficial aspects of the movement.  This resulted in a watering-down of the culture, fashion and philosophy of the hippie movement. {{Talkfact}}

==Hippie slang and the Wolof language ==

I have deleted this section, which is very silly. None of the words given were specific to the hippies, and their derivations from African languages, presumably via 300 years of African-American usage, is highly dubious. And even if it's true, so what? [[Psychedelic]] comes from Ancient Greek words, but what does that prove? [[User:Adam Carr|Adam]] 11:30, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
That could prove that the mentality that the hippies had could have mainly been derived from Greek views. Alex (Bangheadxyz)

== Remove the Doors ==

I think you should remove the Doors from this page. Jim Morrison was not a hippie nor should he be associated with hippies. 27 November 2006

:From Korky Day:  Thanks for your comment on Nov. 27.  I did a light show for the Doors in 1967 or 1968.
:At the time, as now, there was a lot of debate about who was and who wasn't a hippie.  A great many hippies rejected the description hippies simply because they didn't want to be &quot;pigeon-holed&quot; with any label at all, except maybe human being, not that they had any serious disagreements with hip culture.  Others rejected the word because they disagreed with some serious or trivial aspect of alleged hippie ideals or practice.  Because of media stereotyping, people would say to me that they'd like to be a hippie, but they couldn't because they weren't allowed to have long hair at their job.  I assured them that hip is a state of mind and heart, not dependent on appearance.
:Aside from fears of stereotyping, the word hippie, like any word, can have strict or lenient interpretations.  Morrison, though a drunk, was definitely trying to be hip, and partly succeeding, to my medium-lenient interpretation.  Haven't you heard or read his lyrics?  Likewise with the other Doors.  I don't know if Jim accepted the word to describe himself, but he was certainly right in the thick of the movement.  Are we going to re-possess his Hippie Membership Card because he wasn't as perfect as you and I are?  No, that wouldn't be accurate--or hip.  2006 Dec. 13. --Korky Day, an old hippie, korkyday @ yahoo.com .  [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 00:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
::Thanx, Korky, you said it better than I could. Don't know who the anonymous poster was, but the comment seems to reek of snobbery (on one side or the other: &quot;Morrison was too commercial to be a hippie&quot; or &quot;Morrison was too cool to be a hippie&quot;; can't tell which). --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Besides, Morrison was not [[The Doors]], Morrison, Manzarek, Densmore and Krieger where [[The Doors]]...but that is besides the point.
I read an interview with Manzarek recently and he certainly sounded like a Hippie (as in he had many views associated with the movement...Hippies are quite individual really)...and was refered to as a 'Hippie'...he has also said he is a Hippie before.

== Poor Sentence ==
&quot;By 1968, self-described hippies had become a large minority, representing less than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population.&quot;

That is just a poor sentence really... it should probably be more like

&quot;By 1968, self-described hippies had become a large minority, representing just under 0.2 percent of the U.S. population.&quot;

Yeah, well, either way it's just stupid, since the number of hippies was increasing drastically in 1968, but the way this is written it sounds like it had REDUCED to 0.2 % of the population. And large minority? What is a large minority??? And who did the census? Are you claiming that somebody took an actual count of hippies? How ridiculous. And worst of all...self-described hippies? Nobody described himself as a hippie! That was a label given to us by non-hippies. And the number of &quot;self-described&quot; hippies can changed based on how they describe themselves. Maybe they described themselves as widgits and there were no self described hipies left, but the number of actual hippies grew to 50% of the population, what are you actually saying here?[[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] 01:35, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

== Hippie influence on the visual arts ==

I'm going to assume goodwill on the part of the person ([[User:Bus stop]]) who blithely deleted the reference to hippie influence on the visual arts. Aside from such obvious fields as [[underground comics]], the visual art influences of hippydom were carried through such channels as posters for rock concerts and rock album covers, and the ubiquitous hippie posters which one could order through publications such as [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] and (later) [[National Lampoon]]. [[Psychedelic art]] did not spring from the salons of New York or London. Hippie style trickled upwards to the fashion industry (and then downward from) in a complex manner; I added one link to a fashion history exhibit which describes part of this process. I realize that many of the editors here weren't alive in those days, but believe me, hippie visual-media influences, albeit often mediated through the mass media, were lifechanging throughout that era for those of us alive to see it. Any of the decent histories of the hippie movement and its influence on mainstream culture outline some of the broad strokes; it's not necessary to &quot;document&quot; that, any more than to document &quot;a lot of hippies liked colorful clothes and blue jeans&quot;! Even the snottiest of high-culture venues found themselves having to deal with it, if only by denying it or deprecating the way it changed the reputation of such accepted &quot;legitimate&quot; artists as Dali and Escher. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- What you are referring to as visual art, I think might be more properly referred to as something like ''the visual landscape in popular culture.'' Can you think of works of art in the Museum Of Modern Art in New York City or some other similar institution, during the 1960's or 1970's or 1980's that seem to show an influence from hippie culture? I don't think there is very much that can be pointed to. So, we are disagreeing over how broad a definition of art the phrase &quot;visual art&quot; refers to. I like the concise definition which I think is the more traditional definition that only includes the most &quot;serious&quot; entities of that which can be called art of that which is visual. I didn't really mean to challenge you to document these things. I agree it would be a little ridiculous to try to cite sources for points such as this. But I think that an observation of the goings on in the time period in question in the visual arts, strictly defined, would show a distinct lack of concern with the current events in the hippie movement.[[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 14:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:Well put, Orange Mike.  They might as well say that we hippies had no influence on music or politics!  [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 11:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Korky Day -- But I said nothing about music and politics. I only made reference to the visual arts. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 14:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:I get your point a little more now, Bus stop, so thanks.  We still have 2 big problems, though.
:One:  To the average encyclopedia reader, &quot;visual art&quot; means any art that &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lupin/navpop.css&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/css&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;is mainly to be seen, as opposed to music, sculpture for the blind, the cullinary arts, etc.
:Maybe you should call it something like &quot;serious visual art&quot;, &quot;expensive gallery art&quot;, &quot;high visual art&quot;, &quot;visual high art&quot;, etc.
:Two:  Then there is the question of how broadly you define hippie.  I define it broadly enough to include a great many artists, including Andy Warhol.  Wasn't he one of your visual artists in exclusive art galleries?  So to me, he's a hippie artist who influenced almost ALL art.
:Even if you hold sway with your extremely narrow definitions, I doubt that hippiedom fails to influence it, but that's just my hunch, since I am woefully ignorant on the subject.  What do various experts say? [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 15:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Korky Day and Orange Mike -- Underground comics were great. But they are not really visual art. They are not taken seriously as visual art. They are peripheral to visual art. (There probably exists a minority opinion that popular culture properly should be regarded as a part of serious visual art. I'm not saying that I am an expert or that what I say is the last word on the subject.) But even that minority opinion tends to really mean the incorporating of snippets of the landscape of popular culture into more serious works of visual art, be they paintings, sculptures, or a limited number of other types of visual art. I think it is a misunderstanding that &quot;anything is art.&quot; Posters for rock concerts were great. Stylistically many of them derived from serious works of visual art. But they themselves were not, strictly speaking, works of art in themselves. Rock album covers -- the same thing. Fashion is not visual art either. Yes, in specialized museums there are exhibitions of fashion. Or, a museum of general art such as the very large Metropolitan Museum Of Art in New York City may have a show focussing on some fashion in clothing or something related. But that is not the output of contemporary, serious, artists. As for Dali and M. C. Escher, I am not sure what point Orange Mike is making. The art of Dali and M. C. Escher were embraced by hippies. But the artwork was primarily made before the decades of the hippies. As for Andy Warhol, I don't know if he was a hippie or not, but I don't think it matters. The question is whether or not hippie culture influenced his art. Do you think Campbell Soup cans reflect back on hippie culture? I hardly think so. If anything, Campbell Soup cans derive more from the bourgeois culture that the hippies were trying to leave behind. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 17:20, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

::I see where you are coming from, Bus stop; but I cannot accept it as meaningful. You appear to be applying a very narrow, &quot;high culture&quot; meaning to the broad term &quot;visual arts.&quot; Visual arts is a more inclusive concept than that, and I think it is fair to say that even the haughtiest of culture vultures were eventually forced to concede that art across the planet was influenced (though they may have considered it to have been &quot;tainted&quot; or &quot;corrupted&quot;) by the hippie influence; it just took longer. In the meantime, even we vulgar commoners are users and patrons of the visual arts, though we may never step foot into a gallery except as janitors, movers, etc. [And MoMA ain't the only museum in the U.S.A., either.] The posters hanging in a college student's dorm room; the art painted on a factory worker's custom van; the illustrations in a [[science fiction fanzine|fanzine]]; the graphics for a soda advertisement in LIFE magazine; even the cut and shape of the newest blouses in the Sears catalog: each of these, broadly defined, can be considered part of visual arts. High culture is a minority affair, and has never constituted the sole component of artistic discourse (listen to me, ain't I getting pretentious here?). I'm taking a broad-church, not high-church, approach here, as is appropriate for such discussions in Wikipedia. I think we understand each other better now.--[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- I am not just talking about New York City's MOMA. I am talking about ''any'' museum of contemporary art in the United States or Europe. I am referring to any gallery of contemporary art. I am not coming from a place of haughtiness, either. You are saying that the visual landscape has been influenced by hippiedom, and I would agree. But you will find little evidence of the goings on in hippie culture reflected in any of the works of art found in the art museums or the art galleries of the 1960's, 1970's, or the 1980's. Can you cite an example of the influence of hippie culture on works of art found in these venues? The closest I can think of would be the &quot;happenings&quot; and the &quot;installations&quot; and the &quot;performance pieces.&quot; But ideally I think you should mention them specifically as related to the openness of hippie culture. To broadly say that visual art was influenced is in large part untrue. Andy Warhol was an important painter. But his imagery of the time is much more related to the opposite of hippie culture. His paintings depict imagery derived from a much more bourgeois culture. He depicted bland consumer items. (Campbell Soup Cans, Brillo Soap Pads) He depicted glittery people from entertainment and politics. He depicted gory car crashes. These are hardly images we normally associate with the summer of love. He depicted death by electric chair. He didn't depict someone arriving in San Francisco with a flower in their hair. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 17:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:1) I certainly do see evidence of hippie influence in modern art on those occasions when I frequent museums (more often than galleries).  2) You still don't seem to understand the point the rest of us have been making, that &quot;high art&quot; of the kind found enshrined in museums and upscale galleries is a minor fraction of all the visual arts which fill our eyes and our souls. Indeed, that is one of the favorable influences of hippiedom, to open our minds again to naive art and outsider art; and I believe that influence has obviously trickled upwards even into high-culture.  &quot;Fiction&quot; is more than what runs in the [[New Yorker]] or some [[little magazine]]; &quot;prose&quot; is also what you read in the [[Readers Digest]], not just [[Granta]]; &quot;the novel&quot; includes [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]] and [[Sara Paretsky|Paretsky]], not just [[Updike]] and [[John Cheever|Cheever]] &lt;s&gt;and other angst-ridden-Northeastern-white-upperclass-hetero-males&lt;/s&gt;. 3) I agree with you about Warhol, to some extent; but in his later years, I do think he was engaged in a sort of dialogue with hippiedom, as were many others. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- Forget about &quot;high culture.&quot; You are setting up a straw man and knocking it down. I said nothing about &quot;high culture.&quot; I said nothing about &quot;upscale galleries.&quot; I am referring to ''all'' galleries. Even if you went to an &quot;alternative&quot; art gallery located in a slum, you would not be likely to find a hippie influence in visual art. Why have your comments lapsed into the realm of literature? We are talking about visual art. Are we not? If you think that you have seen visual art that shows evidence of the influence of hippie culture, can you just point that out? And you refer to &quot;naive art,&quot; and &quot;outsider art.&quot; Fine. But please tell me where you see an influence of hippie culture in those realms of visual art? Cite specific examples, if possible. Or at least describe these works sufficiently so I and others can see what you are talking about. I used the example of Andy Warhol to demonstrate the ''absence'' of hippie influence. Try to do likewise to support your point of view. You say that in Andy Warhol's later years he was ''&quot;engaged in a sort of dialogue with hippiedom, as were many others.&quot;'' How? Can you cite any examples? And who are these ''&quot;others&quot;'' you are referring to? [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 19:47, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm not setting up a straw man. You are the one who defined rock album covers, rock posters and underground comics out of existence as &quot;visual art.&quot; To quote from the wiki article [[visual arts]], &quot;There may be some residual meaning of visual arts as fine art. But generally, visual arts is suitably independent of these older, loaded concepts and as such is the preferred term for work across all the disciplines in question.&quot; You are insisting on identifying &quot;visual arts&quot; with fine art, which is why I was making the literary analogies that seem to confuse or irriate you. Underground comics '''are''' visual arts, by most people's definition. You can only exclude hippie influences by defining the media where they were most influential as &quot;not art&quot;! (Again, see my literary metaphor.) --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:00, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- I went to the Wikipedia article that you referred me to, entitled  [[visual arts]]. This is the second paragraph in that article (The first paragraph is merely an introductory description of the article).: ''&quot;The visual arts are a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature. Visual Arts that produce three-dimensional objects, such as sculpture and architecture, are dealt with in plastic arts.&quot;'' That is the basic definition. That may not suit your sensibilities. But you are misleading the reader when you state that the visual arts were influenced by hippie culture. In point of fact they were not. You are only arguing that '''everything''' that is perceived with the eyes is visual art. Is there anything that is of a visual nature that you '''don't''' consider to be visual art? If you want to point out certain entities in the visual landscape were influenced by the hippie movement, and then name them, that is something that makes sense. You have cited a variety of things as being influenced by the culture of hippiedom. List them or describe them. That way you will not be misleading the reader into thinking the incorrect notion that hippie culture had an influence on ''&quot;painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking,&quot;'' which remains the basic meaning of the term &quot;visual art.&quot; There is nothing for you and I to argue over, because this is not an article about the definition of visual art, fine art, popular culture, or anything else of that nature. I am simply objecting to the incorrect component of the statement you are making in the article. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 12:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- You've mentioned hippiedom's influence on: &quot;posters hanging in a college student's dorm room,&quot; &quot;illustrations in a fanzine,&quot; &quot;the graphics for a soda advertisement in LIFE magazine,&quot; &quot;the art painted on a factory worker's custom van,&quot; &quot;the cut and shape of the newest blouses in the Sears catalog.&quot; Fine. Then cite these things. Cite other things. But don't broadly state that hippiedom influenced the visual arts. That is largely incorrect. You are making a valid point. But you are using too broad a brush to make that point. You are including things that should not be included. Please just make your statement with greater specificity. You have mentioned &quot;underground comics.&quot; Fine, then mention that '''specifically.''' You've mentioned &quot;rock album covers.&quot; Fine. Mention that specifically, or describe the broader category into which that fits. But to say that they broadly fit into the very large category known as &quot;visual art,&quot; is misleading, and more importantly, incorrect. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 12:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:We seem to be talking past each other. &quot;Visual arts&quot; is a broad category; many of the specific things I mention, which show hippie influence, are visual arts: comics and other forms of drawing, posters, rock album covers, van art, fanzine illustrations, advertising graphics. Therefore, it seems to me, it is a true statement to say that hippie influences affected the visual arts. It might well be too sweeping to say that they influenced sculpture, photography and printmaking as quickly as they did other visual arts; and it would be absurd to make a more sweeping, &quot;hippies influenced all the visual arts&quot; claim; but then, nobody did. I've changed the offending passage to a less broad formulation which I hope you find less excessive. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- The phrase for what you are referring to is probably &quot;popular culture;&quot; it is not &quot;visual art.&quot; And you have not sourced your reference to it as &quot;visual art.&quot; The phrase visual art primarily refers to serious art. There is some serious art that has been influenced by hippie culture. But you are not referring to it. You are using the wrong term for what you are referring to. Since all the things you are referring to are objects of popular culture, you should not be implying that those objects are serious art. I know there is much looseness surrounding the use of many of these terms. But that is no excuse for an encyclopedia article to not be clear. Even if you were correct that rock album covers were visual art, your use of the term visual art makes no distinction between rock album covers and the general contents of art galleries and art museums. That lack of clarity is unacceptable. It is primarily unacceptable because of the point that I've been making since this discussion began: the influence of hippy culture has been very slight on serious art. In galleries and museums you do not see a great influence of hippy culture on art. My suggestion would be to just describe specifically the influence of hippy culture on the areas where you see it. But you do not see hippy culture influencing serious art. So, why would you want to use a phrase that implies that? [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 23:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
:Because (as I thought I made clear) there is no justification whatsover for the distinction you are insisting on upon &quot;visual art&quot; as &quot;serious art&quot; and the rest of the visual arts. You simply state, dogmatically, ''The phrase visual art primarily refers to serious art.''  You are alone in this assertion; the Wikipedia article I reference earlier certainly doesn't support you. It is from this assumption of yours that all our disagreements arise. You have a Point of View that rejects popular culture as part of the visual arts in favor of &quot;the general contents of art galleries and art museums&quot; as the sole arbiter of what is Art. (I know, I know: a whole 'nother discussion altogether.) But the only justification for your removal of hippie influences is this unjustified rejection of most of the visual arts in human life. I feel it is you who must justify such rejection and removal, not I who must justify its inclusion. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- No, I am provisionally accepting that all the other things you are calling visual art, are indeed visual art. But if that is so, then the term includes not only all the stuff in galleries and museums, but also the things you are referring to (rock album covers, posters, fashion design, and on and on...). Why are you insisting on lumping everything into one super-category? Does that clarify or does that obscure? Or, are you referring to the stuff in art galleries and museums? If you are not referring to the stuff in the museums and galleries, why not make that clear? Are you of the opinion that hippie culture had an influence on the stuff in the galleries and the museums? If so, please explain that, on this Talk page. I would be interested to know how you see the influence of hippie culture playing itself out in the stuff found in the galleries and the museums. And if you are going to say that hippie culture had an influence on the stuff in the galleries and the museums, please provide a source for that in the article. So far, you've only argued that '''everything''' is visual art. And so far you have only provided sources that support your contention that hippie culture had an influence on rock album covers, etc. You have neither argued that hippie culture had an influence on the stuff in the galleries and the museums, nor have you provided sources for that. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 04:08, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
:&quot;Visual arts&quot; is the super-category; I guess I'd call the stuff that you are involved with, &quot;the general contents of art galleries and art museums,&quot; &quot;high art&quot; or some such (I find relevant leads under [[academic art]] and [[fine art]] in Wikipedia). I defer to the professional artists like yourself, as far as the &quot;high art&quot; aspect is concerned. I don't have any idea how you document something as elusive as that - it's just that a lot of modern art like Haring (who was a pseudo-outsider), seems to me to show traces of the barrier-breaking that the hippies conducted. Such theoretical discussion wearies and annoys, rather than enlightens; I'd rather listen to [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]] debate the internal history of the [[4th International]] than get into a lengthy discussion of [[contemporary art]] vs. [[post-modernism]], both of which reek of the doctoral thesis. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- Visual art includes the stuff found in art galleries and museums. Yet the stuff found in galleries and museums was '''not''' influenced by hippie culture. You only have sources for visual art '''other''' than that found in galleries and museums. (Note that I am accepting your definition of visual art as applying to all the things that you have wished to have it apply to, such as fashion design, rock concert posters, album cover art, etc.) Please use a term or terms that refer to what you are actually sourcing. Why are you apparently obsessed with using a term that is '''not''' applicable to the visual art found in museums and galleries? All you are arguing for is your right to write a misleading sentence. Why not accurately describe what you are wishing to say? And why not say what your sources support? [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 15:25, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:How many aspects of the visual arts must one demonstrate before your desire to eliminate the term will be quelled?  The sentence in question discusses  how hippie culture spread worldwide--primarily through music with the dramatic and visual arts in tow--not the overall impact of hippie culture on the whole body of art known as &quot;the visual arts.&quot;

:This is the lead--the place to detail exactly which visual arts were involved would be in the body of the article. The influence of hippie culture on the visual arts would be an extension of that topic, perhaps appropriately located under &quot;Legacy.&quot;  Go for it! [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 18:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 -- I cannot tell you, or Orange Mike, exactly what terminology to use to refer to the entities in the visual arts that you wish to refer to. But if you were to say to me that hippie culture had an influence on the art found in art museums and art galleries, I would ask for some examples. And I would ask you to cite some sources. Orange Mike has spoken of album cover art, posters for rock concerts, and clothing fashions. These things, by and large, are not the things found in the art museums or the art galleries. I am willing to grant you, and Orange Mike, that these sorts of things can be called visual art. But that does not alter the fact that what had previously been called visual art, is still called visual art. And that realm of visual art, which is a vast realm, remained virtually untouched by influences from hippie culture. I would use phrases such as &quot;elements of the visual landscape,&quot; or &quot;elements of popular culture.&quot; Those sorts of phrases might serve as an introductory phrase to the things you and Orange Mike are referring to. The simple fact of the matter, as I see it, is that only areas of popular culture were influenced by the styles associated with the hippies. This is not a value judgement. An examination of the contents of the galleries of contemporary art and the contemporary art shows presented at the art museums will show little hippie influence. But don't take my word for it. Try to show me artworks produced during the 1970's and 1980's and 1990's that show influence of the hippies. In Orange Mike's most recent post he makes mention of the artwork of Keith Haring. But I don't know what point he is trying to make. Is Orange Mike saying that hippie culture had an influence on Keith Haring's art? I don't think a very strong case can be made for that. But nor does Orange Mike make any attempt to make that case. I honestly don't know why you and Orange Mike have seized upon the phrase &quot;visual art&quot; since what you are referring to represents such a small part of &quot;visual art.&quot; There are ways of saying whatever one wishes to say, and making misleading statements in an encyclopedia article serves no purpose. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 19:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:That's fine, Bus Stop.  However, the sentence in question deals with how hippie &quot;opposition to the Establishment&quot; spread worldwide--through rock music, the dramatic arts and the visual arts.  We are not talking about the influence of hippie culture on the visual arts--that would be a separate topic.  Hope you will choose to write a section on the impact (or non-impact) of hippie culture on the visual arts. 

:BTW, the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; article I referenced does make a strong case for the impact hippie culture made on animated film. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 19:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 -- Hippie &quot;opposition to the establishment&quot; did not spread through the visual art that was, and is, found in the museums and galleries of contemporary art. That is precisely my point. I will just say that the sort of visual art found in museums and galleries of contemporary art is surprisingly apolitical. The arts of music and drama can carry a message much better than the visual arts (the visual arts found in museums and galleries of contemporary art). All I can say is that visual art does not carry those sorts of messages well. Music is great at that. A '''topical song''' can be used to document and comment on a contemporary event. ( Phil Ochs, Country Joe And The Fish, Woody Guthrie) But visual art of the sort I'm referring to rarely carries explicit messages. And that is precisely why I took exception to the blanket statement that said the visual arts (all the visual arts) carried the hippie message of &quot;opposition to the establishment.&quot; I find that to be an incorrect statement. I hope nobody puts that sort of wording in there again. It drives me up a wall. (Wikipedia has a good article on topical songs.) [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 21:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:Even if we were to accept your (Bus Stop's) premise that &quot;galleries of contemporary art and the contemporary art shows presented at the art museums will show little hippie influence&quot; (and I consider it a dubious assertion at best), so what?  Visual art, as we've been trying to tell you, encompasses a vast universe outside the parochial world of &quot;high art&quot;; and nobody but you accepts the idea that the &quot;realm of visual art, which is a vast realm, remained virtually untouched by influences from hippie culture&quot;! You claim that the tiny sub-set of visual art with which you are most concerned remains untainted by the hippies; even if true, that would not change the reality that the real &quot;vast realm of visual art&quot; encompasses all those subjects, genres and media you dismiss as &quot;popular culture.&quot; To cut those out of &quot;visual art&quot; in the lead, is to falsify the evidence. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Orange Mike -- I am not dismissing anything. You are once again setting up straw men and then knocking them down. I am not making a value judgement. I am differentiating between the items that you've mentioned, and that which is found in contemporary museums of art, and contemporary art galleries. You keep referring to &quot;high art,&quot; not me. And please stop arguing with me over your tired argument that anything of a visual nature is properly called &quot;visual art,&quot; because I have already conceded that you are right. I accept that rock music posters are art, and the artwork found on music album covers is also art. But this is an encyclopedia article.  We are supposed to cite our sources, are we not? If you can't cite a source that the art found in museums and galleries were influenced by hippie culture, should you be making that contention? By the way, I don't think I've once used the term &quot;high art&quot; in this entire exchange. Nor have I used terms like &quot;untainted.&quot; You are introducing terms that carry value judgements, not I. Please cite your sources for what you wish to say, and don't make big, sweeping statements, if you only have sources to support some small aspect of those statements. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 20:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm amazed and annoyed that this has gone on so long and with such repetition since I last looked a couple of days ago.  This debate should be instead in the entry for visual arts.  Using the term &quot;visual landscape&quot; as it reads now in this article, is an acceptable compromise, I guess.[[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 22:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

However, Bus stop, I can't, let pass your shocking misinterpretation of Andy Warhol's entire ouvre.  Do you think Warhol was simply extolling the virtues of eating Campbell's soup?!  No, he was showing us the subtle absurdity of the mainstream culture through very hip eyes.  And he was so subtle that you and many others don't even realize how hip he was.[[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 22:15, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Korky Day -- I did not mean to say that Andy Warhol was extolling the virtues of Campbell's Soup. You make me laugh. I think Andy Warhol was a very good artist. I was only pointing out that you couldn't see, in Andy Warhol's work, an expression of anything that could be associated with a &quot;hippie philosophy.&quot; You are right that he was subtle. And he undoubtedly was &quot;hip.&quot; I think the best proof of that is that if you stopped most people on the street and asked them if they liked the work of Andy Warhol, their answer would be &quot;No.&quot; Andy Warhol took a brave stand and put out there what we needed to see, whether we knew we needed to see it or not. And he was so forward thinking, and so brave in his art, that people are still trying to catch up with his message. I think some of the paintings of Andy Warhol are some of the best works of American art of the twentieth century. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 22:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Bus Stop--  &quot;Visual landscape&quot; means nothing--gag!  Conjurs up the image of looking out over a pastoral setting.  The reality is that art, posters, still photographs and film that were instrumental in spreading hippie opposition to the establishement worldwide.  But, never mind, I'm done.  Water it down and make it meaningless all you want.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 05:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 -- &quot;Visual landscape&quot; is an example of me writing for someone else. It is not possible for me to choose the words for someone else to express something. I raised an objection. Then I delayed actually rephrasing that sentence for a day or two. Resolution of disagreement involves addressing one another's issues. I do not think Orange Mike engaged me in the point to point dialogue that might have reached the resolution that you rightly call for. These Talk pages are not hot air corridors. Either two people disagreeing attempt to understand one another, or resolution of issues is impossible. At this point &quot;visual landscape&quot; is the best thing I can come up with. But it is really not my responsibility to come up with ideal wording. I raised an objection. My objection was to the use of the sweepingly broad term &quot;visual art.&quot;  My objection was that it included '''too much.''' The use of the phrase &quot;visual art,&quot; in this place, in this article, runs roughshod over all of the visual art that did '''not''' participate in this dissemination of hippie &quot;opposition to the establishment&quot; that you refer to.  Did the &quot;Minimalism&quot; movement in visual art participate in the dissemination that you refer to?  Did the &quot;Conceptualism&quot; movement in visual art participate in the dissemination of the &quot;hippie opposition to the establishment worldwide&quot; that you refer to? There is too much ambiguity built in to the use of &quot;the visual arts&quot; as I first found it in this article. It is misleading. In addition to the posters that advertised rock concerts there is a world of activity in the world of contemporary art that also falls under the heading &quot;visual art.&quot; Did the &quot;Pop art&quot; movement in visual art spread &quot;hippie opposition to the establishment?&quot; Did the &quot;Photo-realism&quot; movement in visual art help to spread the hippie opposition to the &quot;establishment&quot; worldwide? There are many more &quot;movements&quot; that various commentators identify.  This whole activity and dialogue basically involves the art found in the museums and galleries of contemporary art. Should the article be inadvertently implying that the activity in contemporary art as found in museums and galleries participated in disseminating that hippie point of view? One alternative solution is to briefly list the areas that you and others are referring to. The rules for writing an article are not written in stone. Even though it is the introductory paragraph I don't think it would be such a bad idea if you just listed a hodgepodge of categories involved in the dissemination of this hippie philosophy. (Furthermore, I don't think this &quot;hippie opposition to the establishment&quot; is an unassailable monolith of a concept. But that's another topic for discussion.) I agree with you that the phrase &quot;visual landscape&quot; is pretty vague. But how else would you say it? Can you or anyone else suggest a preferable wording? The problem is that the realm of that which is &quot;visual&quot; is enormous. But the problem which I have raised is that the term &quot;visual art&quot; also has a meaning, and that shouldn't be dispensed with, especially in this instance where it's use results in a broad range of incorrect implications. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 14:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;'''Most''' aspects of the visual arts&quot; would be an appropriate qualification. Here's the list from the Wikipedia article &quot;Visual Arts&quot;:

:''Collage'', ''Comics'', Computer art, ''Conceptual art'', ''Crafts'', ''Decollage'', ''Decorative art'', ''Design'', ''Drawing'', ''Film'', ''Found art'', ''Graffiti'', Graphic design, ''Illustration'', ''Installation art'', ''Landscape art'', Mail art, ''Mixed media'', Painting, ''Photography'', Portraiture, Old master print, Printmaking, ''Sculpture'', ''Sketch (visual drawing)'', ''Sound art'', ''Textile art'', Video art.  

:I've highlighted the ones that are applicable to hippiedom. A clear '''most'''. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 17:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle -- It may be on Wikipedia, but it is ridiculous. That is a pointless listing of art related terms. It is listing techniques with movements. Drawing is a technique. Conceptual art is a movement. In addition to techniques and movements it has descriptive terms. Portraiture is a descriptive term. Does &quot;portraiture&quot; indicate what technique is used to achieve the portrait? Does &quot;portraiture&quot; indicate what movement the portrait is a part of? That is just a ludicrous jumble of art related terms. Let me make one more point: The ones you have highlighted are only categories. Do you think that most of the items produced in each of the categories that you've highlighted have advanced the hippie philosophy of opposing the Establishment? Most visual art does not push any political cause. Art is primarily about art. Whenever art has served to promote messages, the art has suffered. The former Soviet Union employed artists to produce propaganda. The result was utterly boring and forgotten artwork. Hitler's Third Reich suppressed free expression in the arts. Do you think that resulted in good art, or any art? I realize that art which promoted the ideals of the hippie movement were freely produced. No one compelled anyone to make art that promoted equality, peace, anti-materialism, and other good qualities. It is only to a very limited extent that these ideals can be carried in the visual arts. You and others have mentioned most of them. I am a big fan of the posters that promoted rock concerts. They were beautiful. They were psychedelic. In point of fact they derive stylistically, in part, from previous art movements, such as that of &quot;art nouveau.&quot; The instances of art actually advancing causes, in this case the hippie philosophy, are really very small. As I've said so many times, most of what goes on in museums and art galleries of contemporary art does not promote any cause, at least not in such a blatant way as to &quot;oppose the Establishment.&quot; I'll say this again: most art is about art. The reason why Andy Warhol is so highly regarded is because of his comments on art. I don't mean that he issued statements in the form of words on paper, that commented on art, but that his paintings said about art what no other means could possibly say. It is really an embarrassing statement to say that the &quot;visual arts&quot; advanced the hippie philosophy of opposition to the Establishment. Anyone who cares about the dignity of this article should not want such a silly declaration in it. It is ludicrous to think that &quot;visual art&quot; advanced any such cause. An enlightened understanding of visual art never attributes such easily pinpoint-able concerns to it, at least in my opinion, anyway. Most people are still wrestling with what Andy Warhol's art was about. If it was easily understood then it probably wouldn't be good. And, let me question some of your individual choices: How did &quot;conceptual art&quot; help to spread the hippie philosophy of  opposing the Establishment? &quot;Found art&quot; advanced the hippie opposition to the Establishment? How? &quot;Installation art?&quot; &quot;Landscape art?&quot; Please tell me how the art made in those art movements advanced the hippie philosophy of opposing the Establishment? You highlighted them all, so I assume you feel that in some way those art movements advanced the hippie cause we are talking about. One clear example of art does come to mind which expressed a hippie philosophy: Robert Indiana's &quot;Love&quot; sculptures. Wikipedia has an article on Robert Indiana, and a picture of his &quot;Love&quot; sculptures. But my point remains the same. I think one should avoid any sort of sweeping statement about how the &quot;visual arts&quot; supported any hippie philosophy. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 19:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

I only tried to improve it in one small way. I wasn't here from it's inception. And I'm really not all that interested in some of the poorly defined assumptions that ebb and flow throughout it. I prefer concise writing that only says what is precisely correct. I think poor writing makes sweeping statements that may sound good superficially, but that are really a cover up for a huge number of untruths. Wikipedia requires citations. The citations should be appropriate for the assertions that a writer makes. Since you and Orange Mike cannot possibly provide a citation that supports the broad, sweeping, notion that the visual arts in a ''substantial'' way supported the hippie opposition to the &quot;Establishment,&quot; I should think you would want to leave it out. But this isn't really &quot;my&quot; article, and I feel a little bad about imposing my sensibilities on it. Maybe I should just let you write your fluff piece in peace.

Now, what is your reason for retracting your apology? [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 22:41, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 -- An assertion such as the one that you and, so far, Orange Mike, are trying to make, that the visual arts perpetuated some notion of opposition to the establishment, as espoused by the hippies, needs some kind of source. Just posting a reference to a film such as &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; or a link to a website showing posters for rock concerts, does not back up the aforementioned claim. Please discuss this, or just leave it out. I don't think it is correct. I think it is a mistaken notion. And if no one is providing a source, then I think it has no place in a Wikipedia article. We are not supposed to be engaging in &quot;original research,&quot; which is all that that assertion amounts to. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 02:19, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

:My only comment, B.S., is that you seem to take yourself far too seriously for people like me to want to engage you in discussion.  The idea that hippies opposed the Establishment and that the visual arts had a role in their opposition is so well founded as to be self-evident.  There are the posters, film (Yellow Submarine), photographs (the young girl placing a flower in the muzzle of a gun), light shows, tie-died shirts, textile art, collages, comics, sculpture--really it is all too obvious, has been written about everywhere and is hardly orginal.  Enough.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 09:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 -- One photograph of a young girl placing a flower in the muzzle of a gun hardly constitutes &quot;the visual arts.&quot; How does &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; &quot;oppose the establishment?&quot; And, even &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; does not represent &quot;visual art.&quot; You are using overblown terms. You are making a far broader statement than is justified. And you are using a far more broad statement than your sources support. You mention light shows, but you fail to say how light shows opposed the establishment. Can you tell me how a light show can possibly be construed as &quot;opposing the establishment?&quot; Did tie-died shirts &quot;oppose the establishment?&quot; If so, how? And tie died shirts hardly represent &quot;the visual arts.&quot; You are making too broad of a statement. It is misleading. &quot;Textile art&quot; opposed the establishment? HOW? How did collages &quot;oppose the establishment?&quot; Just the mere fact of the existence of collages hardly makes the case that collages opposed the establishment. Did comics oppose the establishment? If so, then why not just say that comics &quot;opposed the establishment?&quot; Why are you trying to make the statement that &quot;the visual arts&quot; (in general) opposed the establishment?&quot; Comic books are hardly the equivalent of &quot;the visual arts.&quot; You have not presented one source that says that the &quot;visual arts&quot; helped spread the hippie ideal of &quot;opposition to the establishment.&quot; And this involves my accepting the broadest possible definition of &quot;the visual arts,&quot; as presented by you and Orange Mike. In truth I hardly consider most of these things to be the core meaning of the term &quot;visual arts.&quot; More appropriate language would point to the specific areas that you have in mind, not to the entirety of &quot;the visual arts.&quot; &quot;The visual arts&quot; also concerns the contents of the museums and galleries of contemporary art. Are you saying that contemporary art, as found in the museums and galleries, in the decades in question supported the hippie ideal of opposing the establishment? I will have no objection if you simply, concisely, say what you want to say. But the present sentence is entirely wrong and there is no source cited for the assertion. The present sentence, involving &quot;the visual arts,&quot; is hyped up, overblown language, for the scattering of visual entities you've mentioned. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 10:40, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

Apostle12 and Orange Mike -- Here are some ideas. Look at &quot;Protest art&quot; [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_art]]. Look at Picasso's Guernica [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_%28painting%29]]. There are certainly other examples of art that clearly carries explicit messages. Robert Indiana's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Indiana]] sculpture, &quot;Love,&quot; surely expresses a hippie philosophy. But 99% of art does not. The statement that you are arguing to make is primarily untrue. Visual art rarely carries an explicit message. It is probably also untrue to say this sort of thing about the dramatic arts. Literature lends itself well to propagating messages. In the way of music, the &quot;topical song&quot; [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_song]] is particularly adept at articulating a point of view and thereby carrying a message. But most of visual art does not carry a message. And if it did, it would '''not''' be very effective. Most people looking at Picasso's Guernica would not be able to read the symbolism in it. Instead of making broad, meaningless statements, you could be pointing to concrete examples, in all the arts, of messages that promoted hippie philosophy. And please don't tell me that just because this is the introductory paragraph that this is therefore acceptable. There are other locutions that can convey to the reader that the arts, in certain instances, carried the messages of the hippies. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 15:58, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm Korky Day revisiting this after nearly 2 months.  It looks like this issue is resolved, from my reading of the article now.  But in case not, I've searched back and got the actual phrase I think Bus Stop disliked:  &quot;Hippie opposition to the Establishment spread around the world through a fusion of early rock, folk, blues and psychedelic rock, with the visual and dramatic arts in tow.&quot;  I don't think anyone actually quoted it on this talk page.  Now I see how we argued a lot on a side issue.  What we should have seen was that Bus Stop was objecting not that hippies influenced visual art, but that the original sentence sounds like our hippie movement brought along the entire visual arts community WHOLESALE.  That we certainly did not do.  We influenced it, but we did not make it entirely part of our hippie movement.  So the original sentence I now see was misleading, but we were frustrated talking about side issues.  Thanks for the reminder, Bus Stop, on my user page.  I hope the others are happy now.

Though I reallize that nudity is a serious aspect of the Hippie Mentality, one should consider that Wikipedia is used in school, and maybe this photo should be toned down or censored...
[[User:Political Analysis|Political Analysis]] 18:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

There is nothing provocative about the photo, and in hippie culture most nudity has no sexual connotation.  The photo is representative and needs no censoring.  Your concern reminds me of the recent incident in Texas where a teacher was fired for taking her students to a museum where some of the art depicted naked human beings.  How ridiculous! [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 18:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

I agree. The nudity is uncalled for. Words are perfectly capable of conveying what &quot;nudity&quot; is. The picture serves prurient interests more than it communicates information. In my opinion Wikipedia should not run contrary to generally prevailing sensibilities. Wikipedia is primarily founded on words. Pictures should only supplement the words. I find the picture extraneous to the information already carried in the article. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 18:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:The photo conveys something important--public nudity need not have prurient connotations.  The photo is entirely innocent. That Wikipedia is primarily founded on words is a tragedy, largely the result of restrictive internal copyright policies.  For a brief time the &quot;Hippie&quot; article had many beautiful photos shot by noted photographer Robert Altman.  Unfortunately he could not protect his copyright and they had to be removed.  The visual arts, including photographs, are a valuable communication tool that helped spread hippie culture worldwide.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 19:26, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

If we cannot risk letting a minor see such mild partial nudity, then we'd better ban breastfeeding.  And we'd better censor even the words &quot;naked&quot;, &quot;nude&quot;, &quot;nudity&quot;, &quot;nudist&quot;, etc., too!  Just the words themselves might lead a child to think of looking at him/herself naked in a mirror and think evil thoughts. [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 22:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

One should also consider that other encyclopedias have restricted from using such images, and the basis of an encyclopedia are words. Regardless of the conotations of the photo, children will add their own connotations, causing classroom distraction. Though I realize that to a civilized mind, the picture means nothing, yet to a child sitting in a Computer Classroom, it is still a naked person, one to laugh at or &quot;study.&quot; [[User:Political Analysis|Political Analysis]] 03:53, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

::To Political Analysis (above 26 Dec. 2006) I say that a good teacher will use the students' &quot;laughter&quot; and &quot;distraction&quot; as wonderful teaching opportunities.  By censoring that, you promote boredom and alienation, some of education's worst enemies.  I come from a family of teachers. You haven't said why you wouldn't censor the words, too.

:::If I carry a sign that says &quot;Nudist&quot; around town, I'm OK.  If I'm walking around nude, I'm going to jail - it's considered indecent, no matter how innocent the context and purpose or debates about ideas versus depictions.  Why shouldn't we apply the same rule to photographs?  That What Wikipedia Is Not citiation says that the material in question needs to be relevant.  The photo is, agreed, non-pornographic and at least somewhat educational, but it is more or less unneccessary and more problems than its worth.  Saying that hippies had little issue with nudity isn't going to get someone at work or school potentially in trouble, and it gets across the idea.  A half-screen photo a reasonable person could consider indecent (this is neither a work of art or a medical diagram, nor even as educational as National Geographic, it's simply a naked hippie), very well might.  If someone is surfing Wikipedia and just navigates to Hippie, they cannot reasonably expect to see a topless woman (again, What Wikipedia Is Not points out that surfing to &quot;Pornography&quot; will show you just that, I don't think Hippie is the same, this may more closely approach 'shock').  So, I vote we remove or simply link to the photograph.  [[User:CSZero|CSZero]] 07:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

::::Several problems.  You missed my point completely about the words possibly &quot;corrupting&quot; youth, like the photos, though more legally (like your sign &quot;Nudist&quot;).  Furthermore, the photo has no nudity.  Only topfree.  Topfree is legal throughout New York state, other places in the USA, here in Canada, much of Africa and Asia, etc.  So to cave in to the narrow view in some states that breasts are obscene and not for children, is to make this encyclopedia a parochial (and anti-breastfeeding) and not international, reference.  Then it should be called the USA Christian Right Children's Wikipedia.  If you want to create such an encyclopedia elsewhere, please do so.  Even if you could argue that nudity wasn't important to hippies, you would still have the problem of those curious little minds looking in the Wikipedia entries on nudity, anatomy, Renaissance art, etc.   You want to take nude illustrations out of them, too?  As a small child in the 1950s, I found lots of nudity in all the adult encyclopedias.  I read the adult encyclopedias at age 7--in addition to the censored children's encyclopedias I read.  Your narrow view that nudity without a medical, artistic, or anthropological excuse is indecent is totally illogical, neurotic, and has no place here corrupting our attempted objectivity.  If some teachers can't handle that in class, they won't even allow Wikipedia at all.  We cannot cater to them.  Anyone who &quot;navigates&quot; to Hippie really must expect a little &quot;shock&quot; here and there.  That's at the core of hippiedom.  Otherwise you end up with a Disney version of hippies who never have orgasms, take drugs, challenge the law, question authority, question religion, refuse to kill, go on strike, etc.  (I envision the Partridge Family!)  Those who want to categorize hippie-ism as essentially religious are making a similar mistake in my opinion.  You'd have a better argument if you said that the photo isn't representative enough.  The hippies in the photo don't look average enough.  It needs to be not censored, but balanced by the addition of photos with male nudity, non-White hippies, hippies of more average attractiveness, all ages, etc. [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 01:12, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::I do understand your points, but somebody else already removed it.  I would've rather have just linked it.  If for some reason you find it neccessary to see some topless person in a field to &quot;learn&quot; something, you should be able to click it.  But the average person, in many first world nations, that is those with computers, (and I spent time in New York and NEVER saw anyone waltzing around with a shirt off [even though it is legal], which has very little to do with discretely breastfeeding by the way), who's browsing this encyclopedia at home or work or whatever is very aware what breasts look like, and won't learn anything new from the illustration.  But it may cause an uncomfortable moment when they have to explain what they're looking at to their boss, and saying hippies are supposed to make people uncomfortable won't fly.  The pictures of different grades of shit on the [[Diarrhea]] article is more helpful than this.  Wikipedia isn't by definition a work-safe encyclopedia, but if the content is there (linking isn't censorship), why not make it as accessable as possible?

You should not presume that everyone is ashamed of their bodies, the hippies of the sixties and seventies certainly were not and this is what this article is about them.

[[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 06:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

I understand the reasoning for keeping the photo in the article, especially in an article about the counterculture, but as an encyclopaedic resource, I don't think it should be in the article. It's simply not appropriate for certain environments in which a wikipedia reader might come across it. Myself doing research in a library, for example. Whether or not you agree (I personally think that nudity is fine, even in public), others do not, and for the sake of users around the world, I'll add my voice to the calls to remove the image. --[[User:Xshare|Xshare]] 19:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

To suggest removing this innocent and completely representative picture suggests either ignorance of, or hostility to, what hippie attitudes about sexuality are.  I can't think of a better way to illustrate the author's point.  To say that it saves a thousand words is almost certainly an underestimate.  -Larry Siegel

:Sorry, Xshare, but Wikipedia, like almost all illustrated adult encyclopedias, has similar mild examples of semi-nudity. If you are sitting in a library, turn the page of Encyclopaedia Britannica and unexpectedly find a photo of Venus de Milo, which is more explicit than this example, are you going to panic? Will your reputation be ruined as a porno freak? [[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 21:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

== 30 minutes of work reverted in 3 seconds with flimsy justification--why should I continue? ==

I started editing Wikipedia last April for a few weeks, then returned a few days ago.  I'm not sure I really want to continue.  It's too easy for you (or anyone) to delete all my hard work and probably too hard to convince you that I made all good edits.  You could've asked me first.  But you and so many others just revert first and ask questions later.
I'm a hippie from the 1960s.  I'm using my real name.  I'm well known and respected in the hip community in Vancouver, BC, Canada.  You say I should prove everything with a citation.  Most of the sentences in Wikipedia don't have citiations.  I say the hippie movement incorporated feminism around 1970.  Not just in Vancouver, but everywhere.  I was reading the media from all over.  You doubt it--and delete it.  You think that's just the counter-culture that had feminism.  You don't have a citation to prove that.  Still, you want me to get one.  The standard in Wikipedia, as far as I can tell, is that you don't have to reference things that no one disputes.  Do you really have intimate knowledge of 1970 enough to sincerely believe that I am wrong?  If not, you should leave the disputing to someone who does.
As someone who was a young adult then, I can assure you that all these labels like hippie and counter-culture and new left were and still are confusing and hazy and disputed and overlapping, at best.  Damaging, at worst.  95% of people resisted labelling then and now because of problems of people like you telling them they are hippies so they can't be affected by feminism, but if they quit the hippie movement and join some &quot;other&quot; part of the counter-culture (the civil rights movement or the &quot;new left&quot;?), then they can incorporate feminism!!!!  I could just revert it to my version, but then everyone who's made changes since then would have their changes erased, too.  I'm too ethical to do that so maybe Wikipedia isn't for me.  Leave it to you reverting warriors.  I have better things to do.  Or do you have good reasons for me to stay?[[User:Korky Day|Korky Day]] 10:55, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:An article on the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] should address most of your points.  This article concerns itself with hippies, not feminism, and most of the research that I've seen does not describe the hippie movement as &quot;feminist&quot;, but rather the opposite, and feminists have been critical of the hippie movement as a male dominated philosophy that maintained traditional gender roles. If the hippie movement &quot;incorporated feminism around 1970&quot;, it should be easy for you to find a source, like Terry H. Anderson, or someone similar.  I've been researching hippies, and I've never run across that claim. It may be correct to state that some women who identified as hippies embraced or were influenced by feminism, and I'm sure that's true, but it belongs in a separate section on female hippies, with sources. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

::From Korky to Viriditas and all:  You can't say it's all right to have an inaccurate article (Hippies) because you want some other article to have the truth (you refer to Counterculture).
::And why do you create an artificial boundary between hippies and feminists?  Likewise the civil rights movement cannot be put in apartheid away from feminism.  Half of the civil rights people and of us hippies were female, don't you know?  We hippies as a subgroup were one of the earliest and strongest supporters of feminism, no matter what your biased sources omit.  That doesn't mean we completely conquered sexism in 1970, of course!, only that as a group we started trying to do so consciously around that year, much more earnestly and idealistically than the average non-hippie.  Feminists (including feminist female hippies) were not critical of a sexist hippie movement, they were critical of sexist MALE hippies.  A separate section for female hippies???????!!!!!!!  That's one of the most sexist, silliest ideas I've heard in a long time.  Maybe Wikipedia should have separate sections for scientists and female scientists, for lawyers and female lawyers, or even (hold your laughter) feminists and female feminists.

::All of you are missing my main point about the revert.  It is that all my improvements were reverted at once.  The feminist part was only about 1/10 of my improvements.  None of you are addressing the fact that I feel like I have to form a cadre of Wikipedians to defend good edits.

Korky Day -- There is a lot of subjectivity that goes into things around here. I have pointed out just what you are pointing out -- that many things are not sourced. But I think that this article, on hippies, is a particularly difficult topic to tackle in an encyclopedia format, unless a very disciplined approach is taken. Maybe I have missed it but I have not seen any discipline spelled out for how this particular subject should be treated. It is a broad subject that does not have clear parameters. Who was a hippie? I'm sure there were multitudes of people who neither were clearly hippies nor clearly not hippies. And every person who was clearly a hippie was also an individual. Not all hippies thought alike, behaved alike, or were alike in many other ways. If an article such as this is not comfortable with the most bland generalities then much of what is treated can also be disputed. I just wanted to point out the inherent difficulties of addressing such a broad and poorly defined social phenomenon as the hippies. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 16:27, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:Korky, I'm another aging hippie out here, and I remember that we were only just beginning to incorporate the lessons of the feminist movement as early as 1970. There was some genuine improvement, but a lot of sexism and heterosexism was still rampant among the hippies and the new left and everybody else in the various strands of the counterculture. These are slow processes, and operated in different ways in different places, too. A lot of Alpha Male behavior was displaying itself in communes, co-ops, underground newspapers, etc. Go back and read the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'' or any of our other beloved publications (as I have been recently) with modern eyes, and you will be depressed (as I was) at the level of casual sexism and even backlash against feminst concerns. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestions to Wikipedia concerning the &quot;Edit Summary&quot; area: ==

I think the area for &quot;Edit Summary&quot; should have a much larger capacity. I think it is unrealistic to expect people to say all they want to say about why they are making the changes they are making, especially as concerns the reverts of someone else's writing. The Talk page is a good thing, but it is too far away to for the immediate explanation that is called for. I think the &quot;Edit Summary&quot; should be further divided into a &quot;brief&quot; section and a slightly &quot;extended&quot; section. The &quot;extended&quot; section should still be limited. But it should allow several times the length of writing that the present &quot;Edit Summary&quot; allows for. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 14:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

== Last two sentences of introductory paragraph in &quot;Hippie&quot; article.  ==

Apostle12, Viriditas, and any other concerned editors -- In the &quot;Hippie&quot; article there is no source to back up the assertion that ''&quot;Hippie opposition to The Establishment spread worldwide through...&quot;'' That is a broad, sweeping statement. I don't think it should be made at all. I tried previously to change that statement to a lesser statement. I just wanted it to say something to the effect that the &quot;culture,&quot; or the &quot;philosophy,&quot; of the Hippies was expressed, or &quot;spread,&quot; through the various means cited. But it has been changed back to ''&quot;Hippie opposition to The Establishment spread worldwide through...&quot;'' Again: I don't think such a grandiose claim should be made here. But if you are going to make that claim, it needs a source. 

I have additional problems with the use of the term &quot;visual art.&quot; I don't think it is the correct term to be used here. That phrase includes much more than what is implied here, or what is provided with a source here. A narrower term or phrase is called for, so as not to create the misleading impression that hippie culture had much of a bearing on &quot;contemporary art,&quot; because it did not. 

All that I am saying is in reference to the following two sentences, which I take objection to:

''Hippie opposition to The Establishment spread worldwide through a fusion of early rock, folk, blues and psychedelic rock. To a lesser degree, hippie culture was expressed in literature, [11] the dramatic arts, [12] and many aspects of the visual arts, especially film, [13] posters advertising rock concerts, and LP album covers. [14] [15]''    [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 19:23, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:Although I didn't write the section in question (I think Apostle12 did), it seems to be valid  based on the research that I've done in the past.  What research have you performed,  Bus stop, and how do your sources differ?  I have no problem adding cites for Apostle's claims, but I get the sense this all  boils down to &quot;visual arts&quot; for you, and not to the passage in question. FWIW, I've already sourced the visual arts statement on your talk page.  If that isn't good enough, I can find another one. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 03:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with Viriditas that the section in question is valid.  Do you doubt, Bus Stop, that the hippie movement spread worldwide, or is it that you doubt that it spread through a fusion of early rock, folk, blues, and psychedelic rock?  Both can be sourced pretty easily, so please let me know what you want. 

:By the way the &quot;spread&quot; we are talking about was not an Americacentric thing; rather it involved a dynamic process, especially between British and American Groups (the Beatles, the Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Rolling Stones come immediately to mind) and it involved individual artists (Bob Dylan, Donovan, and Joan Baez).

:The breadth of opposition to The Establishment was astounding.  The French government was nearly toppled, American society was divided, student riots erupted in Mexico, Prague Spring blossomed in Czechoslovakia with Scott Mackenzie's rendition of &quot;San Francisco&quot; playing in the background.  All European nations were affected, as well as Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and Australia.  &quot;Worldwide&quot; indeed.

:In the second sentence I borrowed your phrase, &quot;hippie culture was expressed through,&quot; to narrow the scope since you seemed to object to the previous wording.  Many aspects of the visual arts ''were'' used to express hippie culture; some of the most obvious are listed.  No claim is made that ''all'' aspects of the visual arts were utilized, nor is there any mention of the overall impact of hippie culture on the visual arts--I tend to think it was significant, you do not.  We don't need to debate it, though, since the article doesn't discuss it.

:I've read a number of definitions of &quot;visual arts&quot; in the extant dictionaries, encyclopedias and so on.  None are as narrow as you seem to want to make it.  Why do you think your unique sensibility should prevail in this case? [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 07:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

There is a difference between a tangential reference and a source. A source should be able to substantially support an assertion, or even an implication, in my opinion. Also, and related to this, one should make assertions with appropriate specificity. One's statements should not encompass more than is substantially supported by one's sources. 

Scott Mackenzie's &quot;San Francisco&quot; may have accompanied Prague Spring. But no causal relationship can be shown. It shouldn't even be implied. Human society is in a constant state of change. &quot;The establishment&quot; evolves too, albeit more slowly than it's culture, generally. More importantly, one can rarely point to an aspect of culture that brought about a change in &quot;the establishment.&quot; One would have to find a pretty good source, to support the notion that Scott Mackenzie's &quot;San Francisco&quot; brought about Prague Spring. Prague Spring was a complex unfolding of events. Even if that music played in the background, it could merely have been incidental rather than causal. 

Furthermore, the dividing line between &quot;the establishment&quot; and hippie culture is not even always clear. The Byrds sang a popular song, &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn.&quot; The origin of the words are the Judeo-Christian bible. The Judeo-Christian bible would be considered by most people to be establishment-oriented, rather than an article of the counterculture.

As for &quot;visual art,&quot; it is a phrase that includes too much, for those things to which you are referring. Not that it is wrong. Not that a tie died T shirt or a rock album cover is not art, but that visual art is more than just these things and a few additional items that you have pointed out. Visual art is a broader term. Visual art also refers to contemporary art. A reference here and there to a work of contemporary art that shows a hippy influence hardly justifies a statement that tends to imply the inclusion of a substantial part of contemporary art. Few of the &quot;movements&quot; in visual art show a substantial hippie influence. The way you are using &quot;visual art&quot; is the way it is commonly used, loosely. What I'm saying is that a more precise formulation of words could serve the article better. [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] 20:02, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Stewart Brand quote ==

I realize, Viriditas, that you removed the Stewart Brand quote once before.  That was in the context of its use to support a much more ambitious statement regarding the hippie ethos.  We both agree that its use in that context crossed the original research line, because it was used in combination with other legitimate sources to synthesize the statement in question.

At the time you said you thought the Brand quote ''could'' be used in a more limited way.  Brand was, after all, an original Merry Prankster and quintessential hippie.  As a &quot;hippy visionary&quot; (http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,3605,531898,00.html) Brand created the Whole Earth Catalogue and he wrote the statement of purpose I used.  Since the Whole Earth Catalogue was known as &quot;the hippie Bible&quot; (http://futuro-house.net/stl-web/gallery/album08) and since Brand was a hippie visionary, it seems legitimate to me to use the quote in this more limited context.

Why do you think its use poses a problem? [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 07:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

One additional note:  Since the Whole Earth Catalogue was embraced by hippies (easy to source), does it really matter who Brand was talking about when he defined the purpose of the catalogue?  BTW I wasn't the one who originally introduced the quote, and it was part of the article for quite a while before you decided to delete it.  I really think it belongs. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 10:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
:I would like to include the quote in the article, but in the context of Stewart Brand, not hippies.  He's notable enough to have his own section, split from the main.  I've seen this quote used by other authors in more of a general countercultural context, rather than a specific, particular description of hippies; Markoff observes that Brand's &quot;we are as gods&quot; line pays homage to anthropologist [[Edmund Leach]]. Brand's quote wasn't really focused on the power of hippies, but on the potential the new  tools of technology held for the counterculture.  Brand is a true wizard, one who is able to manifest creative insights from the psychedelic experience and transfer them to the physical world. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::I understand your perspective.  Though I don't know him personally, we have shared the same social setting since that first Trips Festival in 1966.  Articles in his &quot;Co-Evolution Quarterly&quot; inspired my participation in the U.S-Soviet Citizen Diplomacy movement.  And I see him regularly at the monthly &quot;Long Now&quot; seminars.  I agree that Brand focused on the new tools of technology offered initially in the &quot;Whole Earth Catalogue&quot; then in cyberspace, however I know from conversations with him that this was an extension of his belief in the creative power of the individual--the &quot;Whole Earth&quot; statement of purpose reflected this belief.  

::I support the addition of a section on Brand in the &quot;Hippie&quot; article.

::::Ok, I just took another look at Fred Turner's book (see refs), and I think it provides the reference we need.  In a nutshell, Brand's ''Whole Earth Catalog'' was influenced by the ideas of [[Buckminster Fuller]]; the catalog served to &quot;network&quot; and support the communes of the [[New Communialist]] movement, offering individual hippies tools to both envision and create their future for themselves and their community.  According to Turner, &quot;This synthesis generated a social vision in which small-scale informational technologies could be imagined to transform individual minds and, through them, the world.  The ''Whole Earth Catalog'' presented an informational genre - the network forum - that exemplified that vision.&quot;  In 1971, Brand gave seed money to Frederick L. Moore, who with the help of Gordon French, founded the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in 1975.  By 1972, Brand was &quot;one of the most visible representatives of the New Communalist wing of the counterculture&quot; and the Catalog was circulated widely within that subgroup.  However, by 1975 he criticized the self-sufficiency of the movement, preferring the dependency of &quot;coevolution&quot;.

The Communalist Movement to which you refer seems overrepresented at present.  The section on the Summer of Love makes it sound as though the majority of hippies who came to San Francisco (with flowers in their hair) immediately went off to found communes in the locales mentioned.

Just one problem--it didn't happen.  The vast majority of hippies went home to their communities of origin, influenced other budding hippies, and the movement spread.  Only a small minority of hippies joined communes, and most of those stayed for only brief periods. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 09:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
:We discussed adding this section some time ago, and there was never any objection. According to Gale's ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', the third phase of American communal history concerns communes founded after 1960.  These countercultural communes were part of the hippie movement, and were rooted in the youth who attended the Summer of Love during 1967.  In its aftermath, some hippies moved into rural areas, in an effort to get back to the land, while others stayed in the cities and formed urban cooperatives.  Hippie communes were active until the 1980s, while   Christian and occult New Age communes developed in their wake. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

:Don't recall the discussion.  It's not that the countercultural communes didn't happen, and they were certainly a part of the hippie movement.  It's only that the way the section is written, it sounds as though the Communalist Movement was more significant than it actually was.  For example, if we accept the police estimate that 75,000-100,000 came to San Francisco during the summer of 1967, we need to account for those people.  Most communes were small, fewer than 100 people--were there 100 of these, I'm not sure?  Gaskin's The Farm was the largest that I am aware of, peaking at a population of approximately 1,200--and many of those people never attended the Summer of Love.  In any case it's difficult to account for more than 10,000 people participating in the commune experience.  That leaves an undetermined, but much larger, number of people who fanned out to major U.S. and Canadian cities--worldwide in fact. The main Summer of Love article seems pretty good on this, though it errs in the other direction and does not mention the Communalist Movement at all.

Squeakbox, is the material you added regarding simultaneous development of hippie culture in the United Kingdom and elsewhere supported by the Hirsch reference, or do you need to add additional references to support this claim? We are talking specifically about the period prior to summer 1965 when U.S. hippies began to come into being as a distinct social group. &quot;Rockin' At The Red Dog&quot; documents this development in great detail. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 05:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

I think you should be able to provide real references before adding the material. I have no doubt that hippies flourished in the U.K. soon after the U.S. beginning; what is in dispute is whether there was simultaneous development at the earliest stages. By the way, the film I mentioned &quot;Rockin' at the Red Dog&quot; is available through Netflix and Blockbuster in the U.S.--not sure about the U.K. I'll be moving this discussion to the hippie talk page and deleting the added section until you can reference it.

== Globalize tag ==

I've removed the globalize tag that someone added for several reasons.  One, the article contains a small sampling of global links, from festivals to the hippie trail, although they certainly need to be incorporated into the historical timeline.  As a start, I've moved Nambassa into the history section, as it seems to fit right in before 1981, which is basically the end of the hippie era, having morphed into the Nuclear freeze movement at that point. Whether or not Swinging London should be added is up for debate, as the hippies seemed to join the end of that era, replacing the Mods.  Hippie trail should be explored for obvious reasons.  It's likely that those who followed the hippie trail in the early years helped spread hippie values around the world.  So, the tag really serves no purpose. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 12:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

===American centrism===
Globalising tag sounds good.

:You are confusing the Hippie movement in particular with countercultrual movements in general. [[Counterculture of the 1960s]] addresses this issue.

==NPOV==
Anyway I have changed the npov for the globalize tag as what is here is written in an NPOV manner '''but is hopelessly American and the hippy movement is not, except possibly in its origins, American at all. For instance the Beatles, one of the most important exponents, are only mentioned in passing, Britain sounds like it only took on hippydom in passing from the US and there is no mentionj of any other country. This is a false impression and needs fixing &quot;before&quot; the tag is removed again,''' [[User:SqueakBox|SqueakBox]] 15:57, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:I agree that more needs to be added regarding hippiedom in other nations.  The beginning was American, however it soon became an international movement that included the United Kingdom, all of Western Europe, much of Eastern Europe, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and much of Asia (excluding China).  The music scene between 1964 and 1970 became an intense collaboration between American and British groups, and you are correct that the Beatles were prominent in this, especially with their release of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.  The influence moved back and forth from one side of the pond to the other.  I might suggest you add material as appropriate to round out the article; there has been little effort to do this so far. 

:I agree with Viriditas that the globalize tag serves little purpose.  Many active editors have incorporated all the material that has been submitted that would tend to create a global perspective.  By the way, the [[psychedelic rock]] article does a good job explaining the seminal contributions of the Beatles after its U.S. beginnings in 1964.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 21:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

: '''I strongly support Squeakbox NPOV assertions about this article because the contributions emphatically imply that hippydom was essentially an American phenomenon, to which it was not. The student rebellions started well before the Vietnam War period with huge Ban the Bomb demos in London and Sydney as early as 1958. The traditional hippie peace sign came from these early acts of civil disobedience, these held outside of the US. 1956 saw Civil Engineering Graduates demonstrating in acts of civil disobedience at the Sydney University. It can be said that these very early youth rebellions actually spawned the first hippie movement and in fact they gave precedent for American youth looking at avoiding the Vietnam War and its draft. The movement did come into being in any significant way in the US until after the threat to American youth by the Vietnam War. As soon as the Vietnam War ended the hippie movement became less popular. But this can NOT be said for other parts of the world where hippydom and the counter culture have continued to significantly grow and evolve to the extent that these hippie baby boomers now play an integral part in mainstream politics in New Zealand and Australia....the Greens.'''

The early British music influence on the hippies remains unconsidered in this article.

'''This globalize tag needs to remain until these corrections are made. Failure to do so simply reverts this article into yet another centrally controlled American farce where history is being incorrectly remodeled within the greate American ego!''' [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 03:53, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

'''And of course the hippy movement also developed into the Greens in Germany, Mombas serves a reminder of quite how extreme the American perspective is in this article''', [[User:SqueakBox|SqueakBox]] 14:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

No doubt that one thing leads to another.  However ''hippies'' were a specific phenonenon, disdained by much of the New Left both in Europe and in the United States.  &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; demonstrations in the U.K and &quot;down under&quot; may have been partial precursors to student uprisings in the U.S., but the participants were not &quot;hippies&quot; per se.   

Hope both Squeakbox and Mombas will be adding well-sourced material to support the existence, and continuing vitality, of hippiedom worldwide.  Every effort has been made to include more global information in the article so far; more would be great!

I think there could be a separate article, referenced from the main article, perhaps called &quot;Worldwide Hippie Movement&quot; or some such.  This one is getting too long anyway, even though it only describes the beginning. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 04:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::You and others are confusing the Hippie movement with the worldwide countercultural movements of the 1960s, which has its own article. Sometimes the influences between the two can be sourced.

(ISBN 0-520-21514-1) And while this can be mentioned in this article, along with a description of the Mexican hippie that Zolov describes, this information does not change the article in any way. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 20:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

You always see him wearing some kind of robe and sandals as well and he loved fine wine.He wandered and squated in many locals....a drifter and non materialistic. He challenged the establishment(the man) as well.

:Indeed, if one were to take an objective look at the gospels concerning Jesus himself and what he actually said; Jesus certainly looks more like a hippie than a traditional Christian.  Jewish and Roman historians by the name of Josephus and Philo, wrote extensively about a group at the time of Christ called the Essenes. Jesus probably an Essene healer, is often thought to be connected to this group. Given Josephus’ and Philos account, the Essenes sound much like an ancient version of the modern hippies and the counterculture. [[User:Mombas|Mombas]] 10:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::The Essenes were a group all unto themselves; not very hippie-like. But yeah, a lot of hippies considered Jesus One of Us: hung with the social dregs, &quot;the Sabbath is made for man and not man for the Sabbath,&quot; long hair, sandals, talked about peace and love, fed people for free, got persecuted and killed by The Man (with the collaboration of the existing &quot;religious&quot; Establishment, which didn't want to hear Him). Not sure if it has a place in this article, though.

==Reply to Codex re:NPOV tag==
In an edit summary dated 23:20, 23 March 2007, Codex Sinaiticus wrote:''restore NPOV tag - multiple editors challenged POV of this article for reasons clearly outlined, no satisfactory compromise reached, but one side of dispute unilaterally deleting tag against policy''
:To reply: Codex and SqueakBox have repeatedly added a NPOV tag without proper justification, and Apostle12 and myself have repeatedly removed it.  There is no consensus for the tag.  The tag is being used to promote a POV not supported by the current sources, and in some cases, editor(s) have altered reliable sources and inserted original research to promote this POV.  Proponents of the tag claim the article does not represent a worldwide view.  Opponents of the tag claim that the addition of reliably sourced perspectives contrary to the ones in the article at present, are welcome and encouraged.  When asked how this alleged NPOV issue can be solved, proponents have remained silent, reinforcing the opinion that disruptive tag warring is being used against best practices of tagging problem articles.  A survey of topical, reliable sources does not support the placement of a NPOV tag, and one wonders how an issue that does not seem to exist can be fixed. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 01:55, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

== Compromise for lead ==

Through a series of edits, I reconstructed the lead of the &quot;Hippie&quot; article to effect a compromise that I hope might satisfy Viriditas, Squeakbox and Codex Sinaiticus.  I have remained true to the Hirsch quote, though I have also addressed a central point made by SqueakBox and Codex Sinaiticus, which I believe has merit.

Specifically the development of the hippie ethos was an interactive affair, with its earliest beginnings in the S.F. Bay Area (Chan Laughlin, Ginsburg et al in Berkeley and San Francisco, Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey in Menlo Park and La Honda).  Then very soon afterwards a direct connection was established with the Beatles, especially after Ginsburg's visit to the U.K. and their visit to the Bay Area in 1965.  Subsequently the Beatles and other English groups directly influenced the development and spread of the hippie ethos through their music.  

In other words, the early cultural influences traveled back and forth, from one side of the pond to the other.

The lead as previously written did not convey this.  I am sure that the lead as currently written can be improved, and the sourcing can be made better.  Anyway, a start...all I have time for this evening.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 08:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:As presently written, certain sections seem forced--perhaps the result of attempts on the part of some editors to underscore a perception of U.S. centrism.  For example, I believe &quot;History of the movement in the US&quot; should read simply &quot;History of the movement&quot;--just because U.S. material dominates is not necessarily an indication of POV.

I asked one editor to provide a source, and he referred to several (not very good) sources, but never chose to include them.
::::&quot;Another influence was the Jamaican Rastafari movement who, while openly espousing Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as God, also wore long hair (called dreadlocks), smoked cannabis as a sacrament, rejected the establishment (which they called Babylon) and espoused a back-to-nature and back-to-their-African-roots philosophy. Due to large scale immigration from Jamaica to the UK during the 1950s, this movement influenced the developing UK hippie movement, with contacts often formed when young whites would buy cannabis from black communities.&quot;  Either Squeakbox or Codex (I think)added this section during the past few days--pretty typical of the sort of stuff that has been added over the past few months.  I edited it only for various technical aspects; haven't yet had a chance to request sourcing.

Seems kind of spotty and disjointed, needs work along with the sourcing.
::::&quot;Harder drugs, such as amphetamines and the opiates, were also used in hippie settings; however, these drugs were disdained, even among those who used them, because they were recognized as harmful and addictive,[60]notoriously heroin was banned from Stonehenge Free Festival.&quot;  I wrote the beginning of this sentence, providing sourcing from Yablonsky's work.  Sometime during the past few days, the last section (&quot;notoriously heroin was banned from Stonehenge Free Festival&quot;) was added--ungrammatical and no sourcing.
::::&quot;In Britain, the term, spelled hippy, is generally seen as a pejorative label, and is thus disdained by those to whom it is applied. The spelling hipy (with one p) is considered even more insulting.&quot;   The second part seems a bit improbable and, again, no sourcing.

The counterculture had already been in existence, since the Beat movement started in 1944, influenced by Hubbard's distribution of LSD post-1955, the civil rights movement, the election of Kennedy in 1960, the Free Speech Movement, the formation of SDS in 1962 and much, much later, British rock, which influenced the hippies in 1965. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 13:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

:Hippie or Hippy refers to a subgroup of the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture that found its earliest beginnings in the United States, becoming an established social group by 1965 before declining during the mid-1970s.[1] The developing hippie ethos soon influenced the Beatles and others in the United Kingdom[2] and Europe,[3] and they in turn influenced their American counterparts.[4] Hippies, along with the New Left, and the American Civil Rights Movement, are considered the three dissenting groups of the American 1960s counterculture.[5] Eventually, the hippie movement extended far beyond the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, affecting Australia,[6] New Zealand,[7] Japan,[8] Mexico, Brazil and many other countries.[9]

:Hippies were originally part of a youth movement composed mostly of white teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 25 years old.[10][11] Inheriting a tradition of cultural dissent from the bohemians and the beatniks, hippies rebelled against established institutions, criticized middle class values, in the United Kingdom opposed nuclear weapons and in America opposed the Vietnam War, embraced aspects of non-Judeo-Christian religions, promoted sexual liberation and the taking of psychedelic drugs, and created intentional communities, leading some to describe hippies as a new religious movement.[12] By 1968, self-described hippies had become a significant minority, representing just under 0.2 percent of the U.S. population.[13]

==Hippy Hippy Shake==

I removed the following paragraph from the article, but [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] reverted me. I cannot for the life of me see what this has to do with Hippies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1963, the British band [[The Swinging Blue Jeans]] released the song &quot;[[Hippy Hippy Shake]]&quot; (Del-Fi 4119&lt;ref&gt; http://www.rockabillyhall.com/ChanRomero1.html retrieved 2006-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;), which rose to #2 in the British charts and #24 in the US. This song was originally recorded in 1959 by [[Chan Romero]], with less success. The lyrics, at least on the surface, refer to anatomical hips which shake while dancing, rather than to anyone's awareness or culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'm going to remove it again. If anyone wants it back in the article, please provide a rationale here. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 23:05, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

:The main rationale for including it is that it keeps coming up.  

:Since the term &quot;hippy&quot; was first used as a form of ridicule, then embraced by those to whom it was applied, it is not entirely improbable that the hip/hippy divide was in some way informed, in an off-hand way of course, by the ridiculous-sounding song &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake.&quot;  Since the song was part of popular culture during the early 1960's, lots of people are aware of it, so if we don't include it, other editors will keep introducing it in much less accurate and informative ways than in the above quotation.

:In summary, I think we need to put it back. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 08:33, 5 May 2007 (UTC)
::The material was originally added by an editor expanding the section on the etymology of the word hippie/hippy.  Whether it constitutes OR is another matter.  Apparently, The Beatles covered the song, which was originally written in the late 1950s.  Of course, it is not our job to posit OR, so unless a hippie-related source can be found for this addition, it may have to stay deleted.  Several linguists have discussed the etymology of this entry on listserv  and web pages have sprung up since its creation.  We're not supposed to be publishing OR, so in order for it to stay, we need more sources. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 20:13, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Amending my comments, above.  I've done about as thorough a search as I can manage, and I find no corraborating evidence of any link between the term &quot;hippy&quot; and Chan Romero's song.  The two seem related only by coincidence, not even tenuously by association.  

:::So I agree with Viriditas that the submission represents OR.  And I think Sunray was correct in deleting it. 17:10, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

==Further improvements to the article==
The article needs some upgrading. Here's what I see:
*It's waaaay too long at 60+ kb (though I see that Viriditas and others have been working to condense it). An overly long article usually needs editing and condensing to make it more readable. Creation of sub-articles is often a good way to go.
*Some folks have been adding their favourite ''Woodstock like'' festivals under the &quot;Legacy&quot; section. Most of these have their own pages. A nice tight summary paragraph would deal with the topic better, IMO.  
*Clean-up and editing of several sections is needed (e.g., the &quot;Lifestyle&quot; section has a tag on it, but there are others).
* References are needed for some sections.

I'm ready to dive in and would welcome any other thoughts and/or offers of assistance. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 21:33, 7 May 2007 (UTC)
:The sections &quot;Ethos and characteristics&quot; and &quot;Legacy&quot; need a serious overhaul.  We also need someone to visit every web source and compare the text to the cite.

Also the addition of material from [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], &quot;the early and influential guru of Midwestern hippies, heroin and alcohol were negative energy drugs and were disdained, while LSD and marijuana were positive energy drugs and recommended&quot;, lacks sources.  Removed sections follow: &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 23:42, 23 May 2007 (UTC)
===Slang===
An important part of hippie culture was linguistic. Part of establishing oneself as a hippie, and fitting in, was learning to use the hippie terminology. Most of the slang terms used by hippies were borrowed from black jive of earlier decades, as filtered through [[beatnik]]s and [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]s. For example, to emphasize a point they often interjected the word, &quot;man,&quot; and used other black [[jive]] such as &quot;far out,&quot; &quot;out of sight,&quot; &quot;right on,&quot; &quot;straight ahead,&quot; &quot;dig&quot; and &quot;dig it,&quot; &quot;I'm hip (to that),&quot; &quot;to ball&quot; meaning to have sex, &quot;boogie,&quot; &quot;reefer,&quot; &quot;joint,&quot; and most other slang terms for drugs. The most important hippie slang word was, &quot;cool,&quot; and being cool was the backbone of hippie culture. The word &quot;groovy&quot; was borrowed from 40's black slang and was common among hippies in the 60's, but was dropped by 1970 as being too old and corny. Women and men were &quot;chicks and dudes,&quot; although the word [[dude]] was not as commonly used as it is today, except in California. An interesting point is that while many jive words from the 40's and 50's were used, contemporary (60's) black expressions were not used as often. For example, 60's black expressions like &quot;blood,&quot; &quot;what it is,&quot; &quot;I heard dat,&quot; &quot;Uuuuuh, HUH,&quot; and &quot;What's going down, Jack?,&quot; were not often used by hippies.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Everett, 1973, Putnam County Courier.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
===Music===
The music of 60's hippies was [[rock and roll]], which was starting to be called [[Rock music|rock]]. The main musicians of hippie culture in the 60's were [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]], and the [[Rolling Stones]]. There were many more, too numerous to mention, and many more came along in the early-70's, with [[Aerosmith]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] being two of the most important ones. Hippies sometimes listened to other music, but one thing they tended to avoid was top-40 radio, or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio, which was considered &quot;pop&quot; music. They preferred to listen to the more progressive stations on [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio.

Co-habitation among unmarried couples was the norm, open relationships were common, and both Beats and Hippies advocated for legal and societal acceptance of most forms of consensual sexual expression among adults. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  With regard to [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]], the Beats had demonstrated early tolerance during an era when homosexual expression of any sort was still punishable by stiff prison sentences.   Hippies generally espoused the same tolerant attitude.  Many hippies, as in the movie [[Woodstock]] and the photo (left), were casual about open [[naturism|nudity]].''

Any attempt to list the beliefs and preferences of a large group of people can be at best a generalization. Within any group, opinions and tastes will vary. Yet even among a group dedicated to non-conformity, many tendencies exist:

* The twin [[ideals]] of [[peace]] and [[love]] were and are paramount.  
* Performing music casually, often with [[guitar]]s, in private homes and outdoors in parks and music festivals 
* Preference for any of the following types of music:
** [[Psychedelic rock]] such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Doors]], early [[Pink Floyd]], later [[Beatles]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]].
** [[Blues]] such as [[Janis Joplin]].
** Traditional Eastern music, particularly from India, such as [[Ravi Shankar]].
** Rock music with eastern influences such as [[The Beatles]].
** Soulful funk such as [[Sly &amp; The Family Stone]].
** [[Jam band]]s such as the  [[Grateful Dead]] and [[the Allman Brothers Band]].
** [[Folk music]] such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].
** [[Folk rock]] such as [[The Byrds]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]].
** More recently, [[reggae]].
** [[bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] (in the case of [[neo-hippies]]).
* [[Interracial]] dating and marriage, rejection of anti-miscegenation laws (e.g. [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]).  
* [[Free love]], including open relationships and most consensual forms of sexual expression, except sex with children. Traditional legal constructs and religious teachings that prohibited non-procreative sex outside the bounds of marriage were widely flouted--premarital  sex, extramarital sex, [[bisexuality]] and tolerance towards homosexuals. (See also: [[Sexual revolution]]). 
* [[intentional community|Communal living]].
* Recreational [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] (as opposed to drug dependence), usually limited to psychedelic drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[mescaline]], [[salvia]], [[psilocybin]] and [[LSD]].  Tendency to reject the Establishment's psychoactive drugs, which were and are legal, including alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and psychiatric drugs.
* A fondness for [[nudity]]--especially being nude ([[naturism]]), as opposed to objectifying nude performers and images.
* Use of [[incense]].
* Belief in Eastern spiritual concepts, such as [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]; interest in [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] religious philosophies is common.
* Belief that spiritual advancement leads to increased psychic ability, e.g., the ability to see the human [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaskin1970&quot;&gt;Gaskin, 1970, Np &lt;/ref&gt; A [[vegetarian]] lifestyle was often considered important in this regard because it was thought to cleanse the body of impurities and &quot;negative vibrations&quot;. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Belief that a corrupt [[The Establishment|Establishment]] was abusing [[Mother Earth]] led hippies to participate in [[recycling]] and support [[environmentalism]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Belief in [[astrology]], [[tarot]] and [[I Ching]] divination. 
* A [[mellow]] outlook on life, and a belief that the temporal world is a manifestation of human thought and consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaskin1970&quot; /&gt;
* Elements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Transcendentalist]] philosophy are evident in hippie music, prose and other artistic expressions.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Rejection of the typical American diet and, instead, exploration of vegetarianism, fasting, natural food (including whole foods and organic food), more foods from the Third World, and many other alternatives.
* Less competitive forms of exercise, such as [[foot bag]] ([[Hacky Sack]]), [[frisbees]], [[handstand]]s, [[dancing]], [[Snake Kung Fu|snake-dancing]] (martial art), [[surfing]], [[devil sticks]] (though referred to as &quot;spin sticks&quot; so as to not make a reference to the devil), and [[cycling]].
* Alternative ways of making a living, especially not supporting the military-industrial complex, [[capitalism]], wage-slavery, &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;, etc.  For most hippies, reduced incomes or [[poverty]].
* Female equality.  The second wave of [[feminism]] was simultaneous with the hippie movement.  However, the relationship between hippies (especially hippie males) and feminism was complex and often confrontational.
* Raising children more lovingly and peacefully, often with less coercive schooling and with more freedom.
* Natural birth, [[breastfeeding]], no [[circumcision]].
* Alternative media, including underground newspapers, the hipper rock 'n' roll radio stations, campus and community radio, movies promoting hip subjects and attitudes (art films, non-U.S. films, etc.).  Tendency to reject [[television]] and to entertain themselves.
* Acceptance of those who participate in any of the above, even if they themselves choose not to.

Well this is all great Viriditas, but at some point you are going to have to turn over your dictatorial control of the Hippie article to people with actual knowledge of the subject. By that I mean, people who WERE hippies and speak from authority. Several of them are here, and have helped write the article, and have told you, they were there. If you weren't there, and weren't a hippie, you can't say anything with authority. Citing references? I suppose you think dropping acid in 1969 and living in a crab-infested crashpad in Berkeley is &quot;original research&quot; and doesn't count? Who else can write with authority? Some square who read a poorly written and flagrantly wrong book, and can cite it as a reference? Just because you can cite a reference doesn't make something true, what if the reference is grossly wrong? As a surfer dude in Hawaii No Ka Oi, your first-hand knowledge of hippies came from growing da kine bud and selling it to da kine hauli tourists with da kine long hair, not knowing anything about the hippie culture they can from on the mainland, and surfing some more while trying to score with hauli wahinis? Why don't you leave the artice alone and stop deleting everything? Learn from it. You deleted some really good stuff, dude. Mahalo. [[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] 01:53, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

You have deleted such common knowledge as unsourced, which don't need to be sourced, because they are not disputed, even by you. For example, the fact that hippies listened to rock and roll, do you think anybody on earth would challenge this? You deleted the statement that hippies used slang terms like &quot;groovy&quot; and &quot;far out&quot; and &quot;outta sight&quot; as unsourced, even AFTER I sourced it as from the Grey Lines glossary of hippie terms that the bus company distributed in 1968? How on earth can you delete such statements? You deleted somebody's statement that hippie women didn't use much makeup, you expect somebody to find a source for that? It's common knowledge, just look at any photo from the period. You really need to stop trashing this article, dude.

::::::::''An important part of hippie culture was linguistic. Part of establishing oneself as a hippie, and fitting in, was learning to use the hippie terminology. Most of the slang terms used by hippies were borrowed from black jive of earlier decades, as filtered through [[beatnik]]s and [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]s. For example, to emphasize a point they often interjected the word, &quot;man,&quot; and used other black [[jive]] such as &quot;far out,&quot; &quot;out of sight,&quot; &quot;right on,&quot; &quot;straight ahead,&quot; &quot;dig&quot; and &quot;dig it,&quot; &quot;I'm hip (to that),&quot; &quot;to ball&quot; meaning to have sex, &quot;boogie,&quot; &quot;reefer,&quot; &quot;joint,&quot; and most other slang terms for drugs. The most important hippie slang word was, &quot;cool,&quot; and being cool was the backbone of hippie culture. The word &quot;groovy&quot; was borrowed from 40's black slang and was common among hippies in the 60's, but was dropped by 1970 as being too old and corny. Women and men were &quot;chicks and dudes,&quot; although the word [[dude]] was not as commonly used as it is today, except in California. An interesting point is that while many jive words from the 40's and 50's were used, contemporary (60's) black expressions were not used as often. For example, 60's black expressions like &quot;blood,&quot; &quot;what it is,&quot; &quot;I heard dat,&quot; &quot;Uuuuuh, HUH,&quot; and &quot;What's going down, Jack?,&quot; were not often used by hippies.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Everett, 1973, Putnam County Courier.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;''

You are soo wrong on so many levels. If I cite a reference, my responsibility is to cite the publication, date, page, author, etc, and you are responsible for looking it up in the library. I GAVE THE SOURCE, but you say you can't find the source to verify it, when obviously you never went to the library or anyplace else, you just automatically deleted saying you couldn't verify the source from your computer keyboard at 11 PM. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS! I give you the source, date and page, and you are responsible for finding another copy of the publication. I told you it was in the Putnam County (New York) Courier, they are still in business. You just call them up and see if they have back issues. If you don't have their phone number, call information. It is your responsibility to find a copy of the publication. If you can't find the back issue there, that DOESN'T mean it's not a verifyable source. Even worse, I gave the source for something which is so commonplace and such common knowledge, that it doesn't even need to be sourced, but you deleted the text anyway, and for no reason whatsoever!! Are you kidding? I give up on Wikipedia, it's just too much work, and when somebody like you is allowed to show up and destroy the work of so many others, it's just a waste of my time to fight it. You will just keep on doing it. There is no way to stop you from trashing people's work, so I just give up. I will go use Britannica because the editors have to actually be literate in that publication. Wikipedia is a nice idea, but when so many silly people feel the need to edit and pretend to be experienced editors, but obviously without having any qualifications as such, it makes the whole thing seem like a failure.

the part that says hippies used slang terminology. Idiocy. He deleted the section that says hippies listened to rock and roll and that they liked the Beatles, Stones, Jimi, and Bob.

All of the deletions I made were of unsourced original research, by your own definitions, as there were no sources whatsoever for any of it, and I am stating that much of it was simply wrong. Yet, you are defending Viriditas in his deletions of large amounts of good writing that HAD sources. Yet when I delete tracts of unsourced and irrelevent and mainly erroneous content, you revert it back. The net result is that the &quot;hippies&quot; article is horribly written, wrong on most counts, and boring. The photo you use to represent hippies of the USA in the 60's is a photo of a Russian guy in 2005. All the citations of miniscule events that happened in California, yet not a word about Ann Arbor, Boulder, Austin, or Greenwich Village, all of which had thriving hippie scenes by 1965, is very very wrong. You mention one band (forgot who) and say it was the first band to play on stage tripping on LSD? How could you possibly know such a thing? And where is the source??

Afterall, I know old hippies, young hippies, activist hippies as well as hippies who just sit around and get high.  No one will have the difinitive definition for this and for all intents and purposes, the article is fine how it is.

I completely disagrea the removal of this part of the article. For me these facts were the essence op hippydom. In Amsterdam, Europe, there was in the sixties a full mixture of music and politics, like the Vietnam war or cold war. A monthly like &quot;Hitweek&quot; brought this up, as did the Provo's who opposed &quot;truttigheid&quot;. As an elderly hippy I still believe in these things, as do my children.

I vote that the guy is a bad parody of hippies. He's in Russia and 4 decades off. The caption is a joke, (&quot;Singer at a modern Hippie movement.&quot; What's a hippie movement?) and it contains no citations. How do we know we even have copyright license for that photo? Being a hippie is not about how you dress or hold a guitar pretending to be a guitarist. That guy is a hippie like Dobie Gillis was a beatnik. That guy is a hippie like a speghetti western from the 1950's had real Indians. He's a joke of a hippie, in costume only, a bad parody and insulting, and the way he's fingering the frets you can see he can't even play guitar. His clothes are clean, he has no lice and he is not stoned.

I was only kidding about being dirty, I actually cleaned by jeans about once a month by swimming with my pants on. Then, every two years or so, after the patches on my patches started falling off, I panhandled up enough to get a whole new pair of jeans at Salvation Army for $1, and they were totally clean for a few weeks. But I never wore underpants and slept with my jeans on every night so I don't know how dirty they got, patchouli took care of the smell.

:::There is a problem with Wikipedia's &quot;Original Research&quot; policy, especially when it comes to describing hippies and the Summer of Love.  The problem is that &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Newsweek,&quot; and most of those who wrote about what was happening wrote from a perspective of non-understanding.  Some were better than others, but most had to pander to a &quot;straight&quot; agenda; even if they actually &quot;grokked&quot; what was happening, they couldn't write it that way.

:::An extreme example was outright, purposeful distortion.  During People's Park I had a friend whose apartment was on Telegraph Ave., and the &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporters used her telephone to call in their stories.   One &quot;Time&quot; reporter attempted to report--accurately--that the police were engaging in violent, unprovoked attacks against those protesting the destruction of the park.

:::Yes, not truth (Kant, Popper, et al, apply here). From what I've seen, verifiable in Wiki means supported by citation. Yet, we know that articles can be wrong. In fact, not a few technical articles that were heavily cited were shown to be wrong, however noone went back to track all the citations and footnote these (it's like the retractions of the press being buried in small print inside the pages somewhere - retractions on Wiki can be handled bold face (or is that bald face?)). Citation-able is not sufficient. Since the 'hippie' thing was so central to the US mindset (obvious distinction between the 'norm' and a more insightful view) and to what we see as progressive (yeah, boomers are now going to play their havoc with Medicare) and since it will not go away (we have the 50 down the road), perhaps the set of pages related to hippie (60 style or the more modern wannabes) might be a good place to look at what's allowed in Wiki. The page needs to be re-arranged into new categories, one of which would be devoted to this early boomer phenomenon. Let's face it; the majority of the boomers and all succeeding generations were either too young or only of potential prior to the main events. Yet, the pre (beats) and the posts (continuation of the energy because it DOES (or did) touch the 'truth') views need to be aired too. Perhaps, after we get all that collected then a general view of the disinterested 'observer' (which Wiki is trying to maintain) could be written (it cannot be found in the old press clippings - or even the newer media reviews). We have too many views and fingers in this pot, yet from what I've seen of most scientific (and religious) controversies as handled on Wiki, there's nothing better. I use Wiki as reference all the time (There is no written document on the planet that covers the ins and outs of mathematics and its foundations better, for instance, yet those pages are still evolving.

**Citation 10 for this statement links to an excerpt from Brown and Gaines book, &quot;The Love You Make. An Insider's Story of The Beatles&quot;, which doesn't support this claim directly, but merely states that Dylan got the Beatles stoned; if this is supposed to support the statement that &quot;the hippie ethos influenced The Beatles&quot;, I would suggest that this is a stretch.

The writer claims that the hippie movement in America was mostly a political protest movement while in the UK it became a way of life, however, other authoritative writers on the subject have not made that observation, and in fact contradict it (Writer Charles A.

''Around that time, Ginsberg connected with Ken Kesey, who was participating in CIA sponsored LSD trials while a student at Stanford.

== Places other than California ==

Who is going to write about other places than California in the early formative years of hippies? Ann Arbor and John Sinclair, [http://bentley.umich.edu/bhl/refhome/jls/John.htm], Greenwich Village (a hippie spot since way before 1967) &quot;The Hill&quot; in Boulder in 1965. The article makes it look like it all started in one place, SF, in 1967. This is obviously not true, because these guys traveled around constantly, hitch-hiking everywhere. The Pranksters lived on a bus for crissakes. 1965 had hippies all  over, even the Beatles were hippies in 1965, just look at the Rubber Soul album. Bob Dylan turned them on to pot in 1964 in New York City. The hippie thing was around for years before 1967 but the media pegged it as SF, and that's why millions of hippies congregated there in 1967. Almost everybody in the summer of love in SF was from someplace else. They read it in Newsweek. But they were already hippies when they got there. So all the details about the goings on in SF need to be downplayed and other places need to be mentioned. There were hippies all over by 1965 but this article has it all starting in SF. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Check out the White Panther Party if there is an article about it and [[Lawrence (Pun) Plamondon]] but you never heard of these people because they are not mentioned in the square press that we have to verify citations from, that it all started in San Francisco. Wrong, they went TO san francisco because of the song about Flowers in their hair.[[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] 00:53, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

The reason people write encyclopedias is so people who know a lot (adults, scholars, smart people) can pass their knowledge to people who don't know a lot (kids, people from other cultures, dumb people). The people who know about hippies, mainly ex-hippies, write what they know, and the 10-year-old kid who just moved here from China can look it up. There doesn't have to be a citation that hippies had long hair, for example, but the kid from China might not know that. Don't remove common knowledge. Don't force people to find a citation that hippie women didn't wear gobs of makeup, (there is no reference for it because nobody wrote it down), or that hippies listened to rock and roll or talked in jive slang. Don't be so strict about citations for commonly-known things like this, especially since it's not the sort of thing people write down. And you should never assume that just because something is true there is a reference for it. Nobody knows, for example, where the word Yankee comes from. That's because nobody wrote it down, and centuries later the &quot;scholars&quot; have no clue. Everybody back then knew where it came from, but they are all gone. When the hippies are all gone, people would be left scrambling to figure out all the stuff the hippies never wrote down. That's why you should let hippies write this article, soon they will be dead and where will you be. Hippies rarely wrote any of the stuff down, the only people who wrote about hippies were the straights, the outsiders, and the squares.[[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] 13:27, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
::About sourcing, in this case, which deals a lot with a cultural affair which it is known that the 'square' press could not get, there has to be another type of source and a way to populate the thing. For instance, an auxiliary site could be developed to collect the 1st person accounts ([http://mobile.ljworld.com/news/1991/apr/18/hippie_tales/ Hippie Tales, as an example]). The SF Chronicle is allowing [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=3&amp;entry_id=16749 comments] related to the SoL (s___ out of luck, from one view). Too, if the 'square' press (or some more enlightened variant that is not 'square') does not have supporting material on the web, it may exist in notes, etc. Morgan argued that a source existed in some location off the beaten path. Where do we find all this stuff that is pertinent? The question is whether there is sufficient interest to round out all the hippie material. But, in the meantime, I do not see why it would hurt wiki to allow inclusion with the cite being to a class that points to 1st person experience. At least, for the period of the 40th, as people are awakening to their pasts, or (and get this) people who suppressed awareness of their youthful deeds (or misdeeds) are allowing things to poke around the wall. Who knows what will come up from a few more months of collection? Morgan mentions a bottom-up approach for an encyclopedia as we ought to have for 'science' too (wiki embodies a new type of science whether the collection of current editors realizes this or not (it cannot be suppressed)). What top-down view is there for the hippies that is well-founded? That, dear editors, is the issue.

:I would say there is definitely overlap, but also contrast; sometimes even conflict. Though both hippies and punks tend to hate all generalizations (labels), punks usually hate it more. Most true hippies strongly disavow ALL violence, while many punks embrace milder forms of it (usually non-lethal). So in general, hippies value relaxation, peace, love, nature, spirituality, etc., while most punks yearn more for being in control of their own destiny and seeking thrills and challenges.  Stylistically, hippies value natural, pre-industrial, or non-western (Asian, Native American, African, etc.) fashions, while punks go for their own over-the-top versions of 20th/21st century (post-) modern-industrial fashions, although members of ''both'' groups have been known to wear both leather and denim, especially in the 1980s. Hippies value togetherness and don't mind being leaned on or leaning on others; punks insist on independence. [[User:Shanoman|Shanoman]] 19:51, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::This seems to me an important discussion. I agree that we should source as much as possible, as dictated by ''Wikipedia'' policy. However, I would also point out that for a phenomenon that occurred within recent history, but before the advent of the Internet, it will sometimes be hard to do. I was the editor who asked why we would need a source for the statement that hippie ideology was epitomized by ''All you Need is Love.'' My view remains that while it is nice to have a source, it wouldn't have been unreasonable to make such a claim without a source. After all, the tenets of the ideology had been sourced, and the Beatles song was very much a part of the scene, as anyone who was around then can attest.

== Research paper.... ==

I am doing a research paper on divorce. One of the points we have to discuss is how &quot;hippies&quot; had an effect on divorce.

:I don't know where you got that impression. Hippies were often prone to the idea that marriage was just another dead Establishment concept, a meaningless piece of paper. Early marriage was quite common among all demographics in the hippie era; indeed, it was more likely to be stereotyped as poor-white behavior than hippie behavior. Hippies were part of the broader counter-cultural movement that challenged traditional thinking on these matters, leading to looser divorce laws; maybe that's what your teacher was talking about. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:19, 17 July 2007 (UTC) (didn't marry until his mid-20s)

== Hippie vs hippy ==

Someone changed the lead to read &quot;'''Hippie''' or '''hippy...''' This doesn't scan well for a number of reasons. Back then, the word was spelled &quot;hippie&quot; by those in the know. Here's what Paul Brians says about that in [http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/hippie.html  ''Common Errors in English'']:

:A long-haired 60s flower child was a “hippie.” “Hippy” is an adjective describing someone with wide hips. The IE is not caused by a Y changing to IE in the plural as in “puppy” and “puppies.” It is rather a dismissive diminutive, invented by older, more sophisticated hipsters looking down on the new kids as mere “hippies.” Confusing these two is definitely unhip.

A comparison of the Internet usage of the terms shows that &quot;Hippie&quot; is used 11,200,00 times vs. 5,760,000 for &quot;hippy&quot; (including descriptions of folks with wide hips). I think we should standardize on &quot;hippie&quot; and let the redirect gently wise up those unhip enough to spell it the other way. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 00:44, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

:Well, Sunray, here's the problem:  in the U.K., as well as in parts of the world that prefer British spelling of English words, the term is spelled &quot;hippy.&quot;   Those who favor making Wikipedia more global in its perspective insist on the inclusion of &quot;hippy&quot; (though they would prefer it be primary rather than secondary).  &quot;Hippy&quot; has been there for a long time now, and if we remove it entirely they will be upset.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 01:07, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

::&quot;Hippie&quot; is used by media such as the Times and the Guardian, though, I can see that &quot;hippy&quot; is also used. The term is also ''misspelled'' hippy by plenty of American sites (though usually in more recent usage than earlier). Can we get some sources on usage in the UK? [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 01:25, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

:::How about being inclusive?  Quite a number of English words have alternate spellings, one predominating over the other and neither considered &quot;mispelled.&quot;  This applies especially to British variants. Not worth an edit war, though I am sure &quot;hippy&quot; will reappear in due course. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 01:44, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

::::Right. Well, I did manage to find a fairly authoritative British source for [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hip1.htm &quot;hippie&quot;]. I also found a source for [http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=hippie&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact &quot;hippy&quot;].

== Hippie POV ==

The hippie article reads like everything hippies did was good and that hippies did nothing wrong. Not all hippies had non-violent protests. Some hippies were violent, which is not stated in the article. Both sides of hippies protesting the U.S. government and its involvement in the Vietnam War are not written equal. The legality of the drug use should also be included. The article seems to make all hippies seem innocent. Hippies had positive effects on the world but also had negative effects on the world that should be stated in the article. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:69.109.225.182|69.109.225.182]] ([[User talk:69.109.225.182|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/69.109.225.182|contribs]]) 12:19, 15 August 2007 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:: This is an article about Hippies, and it should discuss what they are and what their movement was about, and the history and legacy of the same. It is irrevelant whether &quot;some were good hippies and some were bad&quot;. An article about African-Americans, or Republicans, or Christians should not list specific behaviors of members of those groups whether good or bad, nor offer value judgements. Let's remember that this is supposed to be an encyclopedia article, not an advocacy or editorial one. It should report that hippies advocated the use of mind-expanding substances, opposed the war in Viet Nam, and preached (for the most part) civil disobedience in protest, not whether it was right or wrong for them to do so.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] 18:29, 16 August 2007 (UTC)
:::Well said, Rosencomet! [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 18:48, 16 August 2007 (UTC)
::::And yet, the issue of drug misuse/abuse was a serious and notable one for the hippie community, is covered in every major work about hippies, and was said to be one of the factors that led to its decline in the U.S. Particularly noteworthy is the effect hard drugs had on the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.  I'm afraid I don't see this as a value judgement, but rather as an historical fact as organizations like the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic were created to deal directly with this problem.  This is like saying we shouldn't cover the issue of [[doping (sport)|doping]] in sports because it is a value judgment.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 01:14, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
:::::You misunderstand. I was commenting on the statement by the previous poster about everything some hippies did wasn't good, and some hippies were violent, etc. An article about a movement like, say, American democracy, shouldn't include a list of individuals who, on their own, professed to be patiotic Americans and democratic, but actually broke the law or behaved improperly. An article about those individuals should discuss that, but this is an encyclopedia article about the movement, not a scold about individuals who were (or professed to be) part of it but &quot;did things that weren't good&quot;. 

:::::Doping in sports is an intentional practice used to cheat at sports and circumvent the rules. It should be discussed, but I wouldn't put it under an article defining, say, &quot;football&quot;. But this is more like including a section on blown-out knees or head injuries; certainly not uncommon, but hardly an inherent part of football.

:::::The issue of drug use being promoted for consciousness exploration and the like is certainly fair game, including the degree (if documented in an encyclopedic way) to which the movement may not have sufficiently accompanied cautionary statements along with their support for the practice. But Hippies did not want these substances to be used to the detriment of their members or the movement, and sports dopers do. Certainly, Timothy Leary made it clear that he did not consider these substances to be for everyone, and that there were safeguard practices that should be in place, especially for first time users (set, setting &amp; dosage). He even often advised that a psychologist, and one who had used these substances him/herself, be present. 

:::::Not so Ken Kesey, who handed out spiked kool-ade at the Acid Tests with only a vague reminder as to which plastic garbage can was the spiked one (&quot;this one is for the cool cats, this one for the little kitties&quot;); no real control over dosage, no attempt to disciver whether the user had previous medical and/or psychological conditions, etc. But this was not done maliciously; these were young people acting irresponsibly due to an unrealistic belief in their own invulnerability and of how wonderful these substances were for the world. Hippies, as a whole, opposed drug abuse; they just defined abuse and use differently than the government did. They usually put down heroin, speed, and other particularly harmful drugs (by their lights), and decried the illegalization of drugs because it left the purity and contamination of these drugs unregulated. As Arlen Riley Wilson said, you can't regulate a substance by illegalizing it; only when it is legal can you control it. 

:::::To expect a section discussing drug abusers who admired Hippie values and leaders in this article, is like expecting a section on reckless drivers who had accidents in an article about Nascar. Yes, there was a general level of carelessness, more in certain portions of the movement that others, about the dangers of these substances among those attracted to the incredible praise they were getting from the spokespeople within this young movement. Fair enough. But drug abuse, when it led to problems, was an UNINTENDED side effect of an honest desire to explore the realms of consciousness and human experience the hippies had heard were available through this practice, one which began thousands of years earlier among mystics of every culture on Earth. What was so unique was that for the first time such exploration was a popular youth phenomenum including millions of people, rather than something limited to a rarified portion of the society like shamans, mystics, ascetics, sorcerors, and others who usually had to go through training by others with similar interests before they engaged in such adventures.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] 17:30, 19 August 2007 (UTC)
::::::We are mostly in agreement, and while the original editor may have chosen his words haphazardly, I think it is important to address the opinions of editors who see POV issues with this article: they are there just beneath the threshold of a tag.  I myself have tried to balance the article on the drug topic in the past, only to have the material removed.  A focused, penetrating eye will notice glaring omissions, with what can only be described as &quot;negative&quot; perceptions of hippies all but removed. There is a huge difference between consciousness exploration and young men and women running away from home to join the hippies only to be found homeless and addicted to drugs upon their arrival.  These things are documented and did happen, and there were casualties of the movement. Some naive, trusting young girls were raped with flowers still in their hair, and the heroin, speed, and crime epidemic that swept through the Haight and other hippie communities is documented in the literature.  Don't try and sell us the sweetness and light angle.  The burning white light of the counterculture was eclipsed by the darkness of men even as the greatest minds of their generation fastened wings of wax and flew too close to the sun.  Historically, Leary is considered just as irresponsible as Kesey, perhaps even more so, and many people blame Leary in particular for the crackdown on legal LSD.  [[Owsley Stanley]] called Leary &quot;one of the most destructive actors to appear on the scene&quot;. (Forte 1999) According to the ''New York Times'', [[Albert Hofmann]] &quot;said he disagreed with Mr. Leary's popularization of psychedelic drugs&quot; and he was &quot;frustrated by the worldwide prohibition that has pushed it underground&quot;.  According to Hofmann, &quot;It was used very successfully for 10 years in psychoanalysis&quot; but &quot;was hijacked by the youth movement of the 1960's and then demonized by the establishment that the movement opposed.&quot;  Frankly, there's no advice about tripping with a psychologist in the phrase, &quot;[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]&quot;.  And if you're not already familiar with Greenfield's book, you should be.  I'm afraid there is a POV problem here, and I intend to get to the bottom of it. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:36, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::::You both make valid points here. The original editor made comments that were blatantly POV and unacceptable&amp;mdash;we all agree on that. What we are talking about has to do with the [[WP:NPOV#undue weight|weight]] given to particular aspects of the hippie saga. Viriditas makes the point that there are issues just beneath the surface that elide certain realities. That is undoubtedly true. However, there are also things left unsaid about the manufacture of imagery about &quot;the hippie&quot; that the Nixon administration (for example) convinced the media to employ ''in order to counter the menace of the drug culture.'' We cannot get at much of this on either side of the equation in an encyclopedia article. We do need to ensure proper balance in the article, however. That always means that the subject must  be presented well, and accurately, and that criticisms are not given undue weight. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 02:12, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

If the article is already POV by only stating everything hippies did was right and that hippies did nothing wrong. You need to even it out with the opposite POV.

:Three editors addressed your points.  We currently have a section on Charles Manson in the article, and I suggest carefully expanding a section on the social effects and implications of the movement, such as homelessness and drug misuse/abuse.  If you can be specific, then your concerns can be met.  Speaking in generalities isn't going to help improve this article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 03:31, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree with Viriditas for the most part, but the Unsigned poster above has totally missed the point when it comes to objectivity. You do NOT arrive at a NPOV article by expressing both the POV view that everything someone did was right &quot;evened out&quot; with the opposite POV. You maintain objectivity by simply reporting what someone did without any such judgements, and frankly I don't see this article as saying anywhere that &quot;hippies did nothing wrong&quot;. The purpose of an encyclopedia article is not to judge whether someone's actions were &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, or whether a movement or philosophy was &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, but just to accurately describe it.

:: I'm not trying to &quot;sell us the sweetness and light angle&quot;. I have added nothing to the article to imply that the hippie movement was good or bad, or always resulted in desirable outcomes. But you don't do an article about motion pictures with a section about young women who got raped travelling to Hollywood to become stars or exploited on the director's couch or addicted to drugs or alcohol, no matter what was &quot;in their hair&quot;. You define motion pictures, and present their history and notable features, and leave the judgements to the reader. Should an article about automobiles include whether everything drivers do is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;? Will you judge their motivations, the destinations they chose, their success at arriving there, ad infinitum? How about the &quot;dark side&quot; of power tools? 

:: I think the crime and homelessness found in Haight Ashbury belongs in an article about Haight Ashbury, and it was due to the unexpected effects of the enormous public youth response to the publicity/hype coupled with NOTHING in place to deal with this unique mass migration of starry-eyed and clueless young people, NOT due to the nature of the hippie movement IMO. I agree that an article about &quot;The Haight Ashbury Experience&quot; should certainly include references to both those who saw it as an attempt at a social experiment and those who reported on the problems that arose.

:: On the other hand, to say that 'there's no advice about tripping with a psychologist in the phrase, &quot;[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]&quot;' is to ignore the body of literature Timothy Leary published and the lectures he presented. That is one sound bite, you know, and it also doesn't say &quot;use far too much drugs of any sort in an irresponsible way&quot;. All of which really belongs in the article about him, not about &quot;Hippies&quot;, as does IMO the material about Charlie Manson (hardly a spokesperson for hippies in general, or characteristic of them) - or should an article about &quot;African-Americans&quot; include sections on notable black criminals, and one about &quot;Jews&quot; include a section on &quot;Son of Sam&quot;? And there are few books more POV than Greenfield's, which has been resoundly panned by nearly everyone personally associated with Timothy Leary (myself included). IMO, it is a mistake (no matter how popular a mistake) to equate the irresponsibility of Leary and Kesey; when did Leary ever distribute massive amounts of drugs at high school gymnasiums, or anywhere for that matter? All Leary really did, besides his personal behavior choices, was to speak his mind in public, and he did it after years of study as a respected psychologist with real credentials. Kesey was just a novelist, and a good one who's works I enjoy, but he had no background to distribute random amounts of powerful drugs to strangers in uncontrolled situations. It's a miracle how little harm resulted.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] 17:13, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
:::You speak my mind, Rosencomet, so I won't add a lengthy comment. However, I think you have hit on how this article: a) is relatively neutral, and, b) could be further improved. It is time to do that, and I think you have added the missing piece: A litmus test of what could be added, what stays and what goes. I will zero in on Manson for starters. I've never liked that section. Manson has nothing to do with hippies, except that he, like the &quot;starry-eyed and clueless young people&quot; fed into/on the hype. From previous discussions I've had with Viriditas, I'm pretty sure he wants to further improve the article. Let's do it! We could start with a &quot;To do&quot; list. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] 20:36, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
Keeping my comments brief and to the point per talk page guidelines: the valid part of the point made by the unsigned editor is that the article lacks a critical analysis of the hippie movement.  I don't think there is any need to continue to address the false part of his argument.  The question that remains is, does this article accurately describe the hippie movement?  I think we are all agreed, no matter which side you are on, that it does not.  I'm not going to address your point about adding information to imply that the movement was good or bad, because this again, addresses the false part of the unsigned editor's argument.  As for representing the Haight:  &quot;It is largely accepted that [hippie culture] was born in the early 1960s on the West Coast of America, and particularly in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco.&quot; (Muncie 2004).  So we see that that the locus of the hippie movement is the Haight (Ford 2005) and should be briefly addressed in this article.  Regarding Leary, nobody has ignored his body of literature.  I read all of it, in fact.  The point is, Leary did not advise hippies to trip with psychologists.  His supporters have made it very clear that the &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; is the call of the muezzin, a religious rallying point for sacramental gnosis; no psychologist is needed.  Perhaps you are confusing the early Learly with the late, messianic stage Leary.  There is no intermediary needed for direct experience, nor is one required.  You say, &quot;All Leary really did, besides his personal behavior choices, was to speak his mind in public,&quot; and yet evey single major professional and academic associated with LSD has decried this as irresponsible on Leary's part, including not just Albert Hofmann, but also [[Ralph Metzner]], Sidney Cohen, and [[Humphrey Osmond]].  Metzner asked Leary to consider adding &quot;...and come back&quot; to the end of the &quot;Turn on&quot; mantra, but Leary refused. (Stevens 1998)    Like Hofmann and Owsley, Cohen blamed the LSD crackdown on &quot;irresponsible enthusiasts&quot; like Leary and Kesey. (Stevens 1998) Osmond went so far as to describe Leary as someone who &quot;lives in an almost totally hypothetical future&quot;, comparing Leary's &quot;millennialism&quot; to Hitler's.  According to Greenfield, Osmond and [[Aldous Huxley]], &quot;handed the future of psychedelic research to the wrong man.&quot; Haight-Ashbury hippies even ran Leary out of the Digger free store in 1967, telling him &quot;You don't turn us on!&quot;(Sante 2006)  I can go on and on and on like this.  Clearly, there is a POV issue as some people are completely ignoring evidence that contradicts their sacred assumptions about the past.  A lengthy discussion about including Charles Manson in this article can be found in the talk archives.  Feel free to ressurect it any time.  As for Greenfield, please address the flaws in his book here, so you can educate me on the subject. I've read the book, read the reviews in the media, and followed the associated commentary.  I haven't seen a single bad review or a &quot;panning&quot;.  The book shows without a doubt that Leary was ''human'', with all the little flaws one would expect.  It's time to stop the hagiography, the hero worship, and the historical revisionism. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:37, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

:Gasp, that was brief! I'd hate to see a lengthy comment ;-) All good points, though. Tell me: You come across as someone who has read a great deal about it but who wasn't there. Your POV seems somewhat negative about the hippie phenomenon. Not that that is a bad thing, there is much chaff to get through and a sharp eye is needed. As to Manson. I know the debate, because I participated in it. I backed off because I could see that your mind was entirely closed about it. But I think it is fair game to raise it again, since people obviously see mention of him as out of place. Much of the above discussion about Leary is tangential to this article, though important, and should be dealt with in other article(s) about him. However, Leary was very influential to the movement and absolutely has to be covered in this article as well. Hitting the right note on such a controversial figure will be a real achievement.

Furthermore, I am not hero-worshipping Leary or saying he was always a responsible individual; if you review my statements, I merely said that Leary has repeatedly mentioned the dangers of individuals with psychological problems using psychedelics outside of a controlled therapeutic setting, has published his well-know guidelines concerning set, setting and dosage in the use of such substances, and warned that they are not for everyone. I am not saying this is sufficient to save him from being called irresponsible, but it does not rise to the degree of Kesey's actual DISTRIBUTION of such substances without even a conversation with the THOUSANDS of strangers who took unmeasured doses in settings like high school gyms which implied that there WAS no need for caution. I think considering Osmond and Cohen to be definitive and objective experts on Leary, or that they know better than he, is ridiculous, though I have no problem with someone who considered Leary an &quot;irresponsible enthusiast&quot;, or that the notoriety of Leary and his adventures helped cause the crackdown on legitimate research. I have no idea WHAT &quot;lives in an almost totally hypothetical future&quot; means, or it's relevance here; who cares what Osmond's opinion of Leary's view of the future is, anyway, or Leary's of Osmond's for that matter? Any comparison between Leary and Hitler is, of course, ridiculous inflammatory rhetoric, and serves only to reinforce the judgement that Osmond spoke out of personal animosity for Leary rather than objectivity.

:: May I say that I have not revised any history nor changed any text, but I reiterate that no matter HOW irresponsible you may think Leary's IDEAS were, or HOW many other people you can quote who share your poor assessment of them, all Leary did was express them. He did not hand out massive amounts of drugs hap-hazardly at large open-to-the-public events held on high school property. All of which, I agree, belongs in discussions about Leary, not about the Hippie movement, of which he was a famous member but not a founder. I know that not all members of the counter-culture supported Leary; so what? Why would hashing over either the words of Leary hero-worshipers or Leary demonizers belong in an article about Hippies? Are you going to add a section on hippies' reactions to Dylan's born-again period, or Alpert's transformation to Ram Das, or Jerry Rubin's sell-out to Wall Street, or any other example of someone admired by hippies who had feet of clay? To what end? Does one trot out controversial people admired by members of other movements and sully their memories in articles designed to describe those movements, or shouldn't one at least reserve such information to the articles concerning the individuals? And I'm not being one-sided here; I don't think a bunch of quotes about what a great contribution to psychology, sociology, or popular culture Leary may have had in the opinions of this or that colleague or journalist belongs in the Hippie article either. My argument remains that the job of the editors is to help create an article that objectively describes Hippies, not one that reports on different people's judgements of their worth, or that of those they admired.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] 18:29, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
:::Terence McKenna died in 2000, so I fail to see how he could &quot;agree that the Greenfield book is full of one-sided crap&quot; when it was released in June of 2006.

Putting aside your wild, [[Necromancy|necromantic]] exaggerations for the moment, who was &quot;there&quot; or not &quot;there&quot; has nothing to do with this discussion, nor could it.

The subject is not what dead people think of recently released books, nor what you think I think, nor what popular figures think behind closed doors.

:::: O.K., O.K., Terence McKenna should not have been in this list of people who thought Greenfield's book was crap. I've discussed Leary with Terence, and anyone who held the opinions he expressed would think Greenfield's book is crap, but I agree that's not the same as saying he actually called it crap, so I apologize on this point (which you have certainly beaten into the ground). And I'm not going to &quot;substantiate&quot; everything I say on a talk page &quot;with published reviews in reliable secondary sources&quot; any more than anyone else does. I remind you again: I did not add any such data to the article. YOU started the name-dropping with Metzner, Osmond, Cohen, Huxley and Hoffman, and you introduced the line &quot;of course, I wasn't there&quot;, so let's not have the pot calling the &quot;mud puddle&quot; black. 

:::: Frankly, my comments were about the notion that there is a &quot;need&quot; for material showing that &quot;Hippies had negative effects on the world that should be stated in the article&quot; because &quot;The hippie article reads like everything hippies did was good and that hippies did nothing wrong&quot;. I disagree with both statements; I don't think this article says any such thing, nor do I think it &quot;needs&quot; judgements on the &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; of Hippies, nor do I think such material would be encyclopedic. I don't think you actually disagree with this, Viriditas. So let's leave any arguments about Leary and what his detractors have said about him to the Leary article if necessary. Why continue here when we really don't disagree on the issue this thread began with?

:::: As for Krassner, Metzner, and other's reactions to the Greenfield book, just search on the topic. And bad reviews are not hard to find, like this one [http://www.amconmag.com/2006/2006_11_06/review.html]. Here's something from Metzner:

::::::&quot;Robert Greenfield’s recently published biography of Tim Leary — a sensationalist hatchet job of character assassination — has resulted in a slew of mainstream media review articles which basically echo Greenfield’s cynical, so-superior, moralistic put-down. Apparently, Leary’s message was so threatening, that even 10 years after his death, mainstream media still find ways to negate it. In an ironic development that Leary would have found uproariously funny, a second biography, by English writer John Higgs, also appeared this year — a very different and admirably balanced portrayal.&quot; - Ralph Metzner

:::: And this one: Subject: Neal Pollack on Greenfield on Leary (Aug 14/21)

::::::&quot;Neal Pollack’s review inanely parrots the hatchet-job that Robert Greenfield has penned as a supposedly “comprehensive biography” of Timothy Leary. Apparently main-stream publishers and national magazines still can’t resist the temptation to pontificate in moral judgment over a generation of seekers who were turned on by the creative possibilities of consciousness expansion, and turned off by their culture’s addictions to consumerism and militarism. (Pollack approvingly quotes Greenfield’s condescending dismissal  of the sixties counterculture as “a freaky mirror image of mainstream celebrity-obsessed America”.)  Pollack thinks Greenfield’s book is “an epically thrilling, wicked epitaph for the vain, bizarre, self-promoting guru”. But you have to wonder, why spend 600 pages on a sustained job of character assassination of a man who’s been dead for almost ten years and presumably no longer a threat to anyone? Greenfield has zero understanding nor, apparently, real interest in the potentials of psychedelics, nor of Leary’s bold and irreverent attempts to explore these potentials. As a close collaborator of Leary and Alpert, both at Harvard and Millbrook, and a life-long friend of both men, my regret at having naïvely agreed to talk with Greenfield is only tempered by the realization that he would have written his hit-piece anyway. Of course Leary had his faults, like any man. One thing I do know is that he also had the capacity to laugh at himself and his failings, to treat everyone he encountered with total respect and generosity, and without malice. At a time when university research projects are starting to replicate studies that our Harvard project published over 40 years ago, those who would like a deeper understanding of the man and his visionary work should read the eminently fair and balanced biography, only published in the UK so far, by John  Higgs, -- I Have America Surrounded.&quot;

Unlike [[Jesse Walker]]'s naive review and Metzner's self-interested editorial (Metzner is the co-author of ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' with [[Timothy Leary]]), [[Paul Krassner]]'s interview with author John Higgs regarding this very issue hits the target.  Perhaps Walker and Metzner can learn a thing or two from Higgs:
::&quot;Most of the mud that has been slung at Leary is perfectly true, but you can be factually accurate and wildly misleading at the same time. For instance, if someone asked me to describe Winston Churchill, I could say he was a mentally ill drunk who lost the 1945 UK General Election. And I'd be factually correct, but that wouldn't mean I was being fair, or that I'd nailed the essence of the man. With Leary, for everyone with a complaint against him, there are countless people who credit him with enriching their lives on a very profound level, and I don't understand the desire to ignore this.  Ultimately, you can't hope to understand why he did what he did if you refuse to look at the ideas that drove him. Leary was too complicated a figure to dismiss as either a saint or a moron, as many people try to. He's probably the best example of the &quot;trickster&quot; archetype that the 20th Century produced, and his ambiguity is key to understanding him. The crux of his philosophy was the extent to which the reality that appears to be external to us is actually a model constructed by our own minds, a model that we are responsible for and which in certain circumstances can change. This is a frightening and unsettling idea, but it is also liberating. The implication is that if you hear someone describe Leary as a saint or as a moron, then they are not really telling you anything about Tim, but revealing something about themselves. Leary used to say, &quot;You get the Timothy Leary you deserve.&quot; (He was being willfully antagonistic here, I think. It would perhaps be fairer to say that you get the Timothy Leary you want.) The upshot of all this, of course, is that it is only right and fitting that we hear so many wildly different opinions about him. Perversely, it validates his ideas.&quot;

:I'll work on adding a section.  Floating Lotus was indeed one of the most notable creations of the late 60's hippie community and found its main inspiration in the trauma of the Vietnam War.  As such it was both cultural and political.  Performances were well-structured, beautifully performed and well-attended.  There was also a communal aspect to Floating Lotus, since the group (which numbered approximately fifty persons) lived communally for a time on virgin redwood acreage located just south of San Francisco.

::I don't think it needs its own section.  What we need is a discussion of the inextricable theatrical components of the hippie movement.  This is a very interesting topic for expansion, as it looks like there is a historical continuum of development with origins in the [[history of theatre]], especially the influence of traveling theatrical groups in the [[Commedia dell'arte]] style, [[happenings]] in the  1950s, the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], and the breaking down of the [[fourth wall]] in the [[Acid Tests]] and early music festivals, leading to the establishment of the modern [[rock concert]].

== Proposal to add a section called &quot;Culture of the Hippies&quot; ==

&quot;Culture of the Hippies&quot; sounds somewhat overblown to me, because the movement proper lasted such a short time and I see culture as something that develops, and becomes deeply rooted, during many generations. 

However there was such a thing as &quot;hippie culture&quot; and, more specifically, a &quot;hippie ethos.&quot; Hippiedom was, after all, an idea--something along the lines of: 

:&quot;We are each conscious creators, and we can choose to re-fashion the world we live in along more loving, compassionate lines. We must not be limited by the societal, governmental and cultural structures we create--such structures are often antithetical to the essential, moment-to-moment practice of loving one's fellow man. Life is a banquet and most poor folks are starving (quoting Auntie Mame).&quot; 

The remarkable thing about the hippie phenomenon was that this idea did indeed take root, to the extent that contemporary Western culture would hardly be recognizable had hippies never existed.
 
I have attempted in the past to add information regarding the beautiful, central idea of the hippie ethos from works authored by Stewart Brand, Stephen Gaskin and others, sourcing same as best I can. Perhaps you might better tolerate the addition of such information in the section you propose. 

What exactly to call it? I am open to suggestion.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 20:23, 25 August 2007 (UTC)
:The article needs a section summarizing the most notable people in the hippie movement.  If Stewart Brand is one of those people, then let's add a Stewart Brand section ''with'' that quote.  I also want to see a short section about Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, and anyone else you think deserves mention.

:I'll try to find specific sourcing for the multiracial nature of the hippie world.  I have objected previously to the characterization of hippies as &quot;white,&quot; since they were white, asian and other in about the same proportion as the general population. (Yes, I know there is a source who wrote that hippies were mainly white, but this characterization distorts the reality nonetheless.)   In fact one of the most notable features of hippie culture was a marked willingness to see others as simply people, with little attention paid to race.  Interracial dating was practiced by a large percentage of hippies, far beyond what was prevalent in the general population. It was definitely considered 'cool.'

The quote refers to Chandler Laughlin, but the wiki text adds George Hunter, and I haven't found a source that states that the Charlatans were the first psychedelic rock band to play live on LSD.  Sources generally agree that they were innovative: one sources writes, &quot;...many feel they were the first acid rock band&quot; (McCleary, 2004, p. 89).  The multiracial sources said nothing about hippies, and this has more to do with the civil rights movement.

Something that should be added: Due to its proximity to the [[Fillmore District, San Francisco, California|Fillmmore]], the [[Haight-Ashbury]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] was an [[Demographic maps of San Francisco, California|interracial neighborhood]] during the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (Echols, 2002, p.42; Lee &amp; Shlain, 1992, p. 41).  The subject of interracial relationships was expressed in the music of the counterculture, in hippie musicals like ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' (1967), (Perone, 2004, p. 10)  and in hippie films such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1973). &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 14:02, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

:::The Laughlin source is a partial substantiation of the &quot;proto-hippie&quot; line.  I might well have added the &quot;Works&quot; source, since in the film both Luria Castell and Ellen Harman refer to Laughlin AND Hunter as &quot;the first hippies they ever saw.&quot; (I have now done so.) This is not synthesis, this is summarization and writing about something in one's own words.  Why did you eliminate the Laughlin quote?  All it needed was something more about Hunter.

:::Did you read &quot;The Red Dog Saloon And The Amazing Charlatans&quot;?  The author clearly states that the ingestion of LSD before the Charlatans' audition performance was &quot;unprecedented.&quot; 

:::The article used to contain material that referred to the fact that hippies were active in the civil rights movement, and specifically it spotlighted their opposition to anti-miscegenation laws. Rather than just request a source, you deleted this entirely, thus removing the antecedent for the material (also now deleted) underscoring the fact that interracial dating is now generally accepted and multiracial children are considered somewhat &quot;cool.&quot;   Now this very important aspect of hippie culture, and the legacy attached to it, are entirely missing.  How discouraging!

:::It is important to remember that no civil rights leader during the 1960's (including MLK) could come out in favor of interracial dating and marriage.  To do so would have played into segregationist warnings, e.g. &quot;You wouldn't want your daughter to marry one...&quot;  Of the three 1960's counterculture groups, hippies were the most prominent in arguing for the repeal of anti-miscegenation laws...AND they just went ahead and dated outside their race.  These were black hippies, white hippies, asian hippies and native american hippies (can't recall many latino hippies).  They didn't just talk about it, in true hippie fashion they went ahead and did it, flouting convention and the law, and it became commonplace.  Now  society accepts it.

In the same way, non-narcotic drugs came to be called &quot;dope&quot; through the habitual imitation of those who used such catchall terminology out of ignorance.

:I think a short mention is appropriate as an introduction to the connection between the beat/coffee house/folk scene in early to mid-1960's Berkeley and developments at the Red Dog.  Such an introduction establishes a clear link between late beat culture and early hippie culture.  However, the level of detail recently added to the article seems inappropriate to me, so I have deleted much of it

== Festivals ==

I added the OR tag to the festivals section due to a number of unverified claims; it is claimed that the &quot;tradition of hippie festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's Acid Tests&quot; however this exact claim has yet to be substantiated.  For example, from 1958-1965 the Newport Folk Festival was popular with the youth culture, and according to Britta Sweers, &quot;folk music was increasingly integrated into youth activism such as the demonstrations against the Vietnam War&quot; and began &quot;mixing with the hippie movement&quot; and contributed to new &quot;hybrid&quot; forms of music.  Before and during 1965-1970, American Folk Rock was &quot;played by groups related to the hippie movement&quot;.  Folk Rock became a term &quot;for the various bands of the hippie culture who experimented with drugs, and would go, like Jefferson Airplane, in the psychedelic direction.&quot; (Sweers, Britta, (2005).

:Well, yes, these historical perspectives might well be incorporated into this section. Nothing stands on its own, after all. Depends, I suppose, on how one defines &quot;hippie&quot; festival, as opposed to &quot;folk music&quot; festival.  The religious quality that characterized Grateful Dead performances (much noted and easily referenced) did begin with the &quot;Acid Tests, and it was this spirit that kept people coming back for more.

Please make an effort to expand that article and to use this article as a general overview of the most important aspects of the movement. I've summarized the antecedent section, however much of the lead section should be moved into an overview of the history and the lead replaced with a summary of this article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 07:13, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

== Reliable source ==

Just wanted to call attention to a sample of some of Viriditas' recent verdicts on hippie-dom, as gleaned from his most recent round of edit summaries; I think we can all learn from his wisdom and authority.  Remember, these are not opinions, they are solid facts, because Viriditas, being Viriditas, IS a reliable source.

*&quot;If there is one thing we don't need, it's a 250 pixel image of an art car&quot; -- says Viriditas.

*&quot;Please stop adding 'later renamed San Francisco State University'. Nobody cares.&quot; -- says Viriditas.  Viriditas just clearly stated that &quot;nobody cares&quot;, so remember - if you think you care, you are either wrong, or just a nobody, by definition.

*&quot;Removing Image:Freespiritartcar.jpg. It's a terrible photo.&quot; -- says Viriditas.   

Viriditas has spoken.  A note to everyone else. Who are you to question Viriditas?  You are not Viriditas, therefore you do not [[WP:OWN|OWN]] this article, so please, do not even attempt to challenge him.  Thank you. [[User:70.105.19.171|70.105.19.171]] 12:47, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
:I'm glad you picked up on my sense of humor.  Or did you?  Adding a lead that adheres to [[WP:LEAD]] (summarizes the article and globalizes the lead per talk page criticism), removing duplicate content (do we need to state that the hippie movement was incorporated into the mainstream ''three separate times''), removing insignificant parentheticals (it is not important to the history of the hippie movement to tell the reader that a certain University was renamed, perhaps you should check the subject of this article), and removing poor images (a photograph of a car bumper from the distance!?) is not [[WP:OWN]]; it's called editing - why don't you try it?  BTW, all content is still intact in the split article, [[History of the hippie movement]]. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 13:08, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Alas, not being a Reliable Source myself, whenever I try editing, my changes are always subjected to little bothersome things like &quot;consensus&quot;.

::::Why would I need consensus to add an actual lead section, remove duplicate content, and horrible photos?

Perhaps you enjoy reading that &quot;hippies wore long hair&quot; in two consecutive paragraphs, or looking at &quot;citation needed&quot; tags without adding references, but I certainly don't.  I've also brought the article down from an unreadable 69 kilobytes to a reasonable 60.  You want to make some changes?  Go right ahead: there's a missing section on the year 1968 that needs to be added to both [[History of the hippie movement]] and summarized in this article. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 13:32, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

== Recent changes ==

I don't have time adequately to address the issue this morning, however I want to express my outrage that Viriditas has (once again) initiated a wholesale takeover of this article, completely ignoring compromises worked out over the past two years among several main editors.  

This is an outrageous, arrogant approach.  To leave the article for a single day and then to come back and find that it has been completely re-written is maddening.  In the past Viriditas' approach has driven away several competent, conscientous editors.  It threatens to do the same once again.   I will be referring this matter to an administrator.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 15:42, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

:All I see are improvements.  Why not tone down the emotions, try not to overreact, collaborate reasonably, and communicate what specific edits you disagree with?  btw, are the comments under ip 70.105.19.171 yours? --[[User:MPerel|&lt;font color=&quot;#330000&quot;&gt;M&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#334400&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#338800&quot;&gt;er&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#33cc00&quot;&gt;el &lt;/font&gt;]] 15:48, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

::I will say that the &quot;bold&quot; tactic of turning nearly every aspect of an article upside-down overnight with a minimum of discussion, has, in the past on wikipedia, usually turned out to be problematic. [[User:Nigel Barristoat|Nigel Barristoat]] 17:02, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
:::Please point out a single aspect of the article that has been turned &quot;upside-down&quot;.  All changes previous to my edit are completely intact, either in a split history section that we have talked about splitting for a very long time or in other sections (discussed previously on this page and a tag recommending splitting has appeared in the article for a long time).  The previous &quot;lead&quot; appears as an overview completely unchanged, while the new lead attempts (still needs work) to actually summarize the article without requiring sources.  Apostle12's claim that my changes are &quot;completely ignoring compromises&quot; is not supported in any way.  Lastly, my attempts to globalize the lead have been supported by multiple editors on the talk page, while another previous editor discussed the inclusion of GLBT, which although I am having trouble sourcing, I have nevertheless added to the lead to represent their view. So contrary to the claims made above, I have endeavored to edit this article from the perspective of other editors rather than myself.  The article was previously 69 kilobytes and now is hovering around 60.  Any material that was removed can still be found in the newly split section, [[History of the hippie movement]].  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 20:59, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

::::Please don't try to pretend that you have not repeatedly turned this article upside down.  As for the new lead, and your retention of the old lead as an &quot;overview,&quot; the article now reads as though it has TWO leads--really a problem.  I think one lead that incorporates all the relevent information would be much better.  

::::Also, please don't try to pretend that you have been in the forefront of trying to globalize the lead--you had to be dragged by multiple editors, kicking and screaming, before you allowed the lead to move in that direction.  It became a true &quot;edit war,&quot; with you doing your usual dance--reverting every attempt to globalize the lead based on unreasonable, literal demands for verification.

::::&quot;Viriditas works well with others&quot;--NOT!  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] 03:28, 20 October 2007 (UTC)
:::::Adding sources, removing original research, and splitting the article into subtopics to manage readability is not &quot;turning this article upside down&quot;.  It's part of the process of improving Wikipedia articles, and it's something you've objected to from the very beginning as the discussion archives show.  I suggest reading [[Wikipedia:Article size]].  I split the history section at 69 kilobytes when it is recommended by the guideline to do so at 60.  This has been discussed previously with at least two other editors suggesting a split, making it 3-1 in favor.  There has also been ample warning of the coming split, with the use of the split tag recommending the action for over a month. I've brought the article down to 58 kilobytes and will continue to split as much history out of this article as possible. I'm going to ignore your usual litany of personal attacks which only serve to distract from improving this article, and I will instead focus on responding directly to each of your points: 1) The new lead attempts to follow [[WP:LEAD]] by summarizing the article.  It needs improvement and I'll hope you'll help edit it.  The old lead was a detailed, sourced overview that did not summarize the article nor reflect the basic requirements of a lead section. It will also become necessary when I add a series header template (Hippie series) as well as a footer (Counterculture of the 1960s see also section).  Furthermore, the overview will be expanded to include new sections, as more of the history section is removed to the split article, summary style.  So, as the lead changes with the article, the in-depth overview will remain relatively static.  3) I have &quot;pretended&quot; nothing, and I would ask that you consult [[WP:AGF]].  I have attempted to improve the article by globalizing the lead.  Past attempts by other editors did not do this, but instead tried to change the dates and places of origin.  &quot;Demands for verification&quot; are still ongoing, and cannot be considered &quot;unreasonable&quot; - they are official policy.  4) I will ignore your continued attempts to go off-topic by baiting me with [[WP:PA]].  When you are ready to discuss the topic, please do so.  I also want to add that you have made it very clear on my talk page and on this talk page, that you personally disagree with Wikipedia policies and guidelines and that you have no interest in helping this article reach FA-Class.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 04:52, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

:I guess the point I was trying to get at is: Even if the changes end up being considered good ones, often the most considerate way to effect them, is to do things gradually and patiently, as opposed to overnight unilateral transformations and overhauls that leave many editors confused -- especially on those articles that a very large number of editors seem to be watching.  This approach may take a little bit longer, but it tends to save a lot of problems and misunderstandings, and is an example of what I would consider being ''more'' collaborative, that is, to keep in step with other concerned editors.  There's something to be said for &quot;being bold&quot; on occasion, but sometimes it has the potential of causing more problems than it solves.

::Thanks for your thoughtful comments, but I just finished explaining above that these changes have been discussed, planned, and announced for some time. The tag announcing the split had been in the article for more than several months and was previously discussed on this page.  Per article size, 69 kilobytes has been brought down to a more readable 58.  Please see [[WP:SS]] for more info.  The old lead did not adhere to [[WP:LEAD]] and has been moved to an overview section which will continue to expand and spiral out.  I am also very close to eliminating all OR and unsourced material which has been defended by a few stubborn editors for years.  These changes are necessary to move the article beyond B-Class where it has been stagnating for a long time. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:32, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

== Semi-automatic peer review ==

The following suggestions were generated by a semi-automatic [[User:AndyZ/peerreviewer|javascript program]], and might not be applicable for the article in question.
*There may be an applicable [[WP:INFOBOX|infobox]] for this article. For example, see [[Template:Infobox Person]], [[Template:Infobox School]], or [[Template:Infobox City]].&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#infobox|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt; (Note that there might not be an applicable infobox; remember that these suggestions are not generated manually)
*Per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Units of measurement|Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers)]], there should be a non-breaking space - &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of ''45 km'', use ''45&amp;nbsp;km'', which when you are editing the page, should look like: &lt;tt&gt;45&amp;amp;nbsp;km&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#nbsp|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Per [[Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context|Wikipedia:Context]] and [[Wikipedia:Build the web]], years with full dates should be linked; for example, link [[January 15]], [[2006]].&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#linkdate|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)]], headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], instead of using the heading ''&lt;nowiki&gt;==Magellan's journey==&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', use ''&lt;nowiki&gt;==Journey==&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#headingre|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)]], avoid using special characters (ex: &amp;+{}[]) in headings.
*This article may need to undergo [[WP:SS|summary style]], where a series of appropriate subpages are used. For example, if the article is [[United States]], then an appropriate subpage would be [[History of the United States]], such that a summary of the subpage exists on the mother article, while the subpage goes into more detail.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#SS|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Watch for [[User:Tony1/How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a#Redundancy|redundancies]] that make the article too wordy instead of being crisp and concise. (You may wish to try Tony1's [[User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a: redundancy exercises|redundancy exercises]].)
**Vague terms of size often are unnecessary and redundant -  “some”, “a variety/number/majority of”, “several”, “a few”, “many”, “any”, and “all”. For example, “&lt;font color='red'&gt;&lt;s&gt;All&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/font&gt; pigs are pink, so we thought of &lt;font color='red'&gt;&lt;s&gt;a number of&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ways to turn them green.”
*The script has spotted the following contractions: ''couldn't, didn't, wasn't'', if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded.
*As done in [[WP:FOOTNOTE]], footnotes usually are located right after a punctuation mark (as recommended by the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|CMS]], but not mandatory), such that there is no space in between. For example, ''the sun is larger than the moon [2].'' is usually written as ''the sun is larger than the moon.[2]''&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#footspace|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Please ensure that the article has gone through a thorough copyediting so that it exemplifies some of [[WP:WIAFA|Wikipedia's best work]]. See also [[User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a]].&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#copyedit|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:I'm trying to envision how to separate out events that began after the heyday of the hippie movement, which we generally agree was 1965 to 1975, at least in the United States.  In particular, perhaps we need to refer to New Zealand's Nambassa as kind of a &quot;second wave&quot; of the original hippie movement (beginning and cresting later) rather than a neo-hippie or legacy phenomenon.  The same problem exists with the Grateful Dead, since their touring history began in 1965 and continued through 1995--1965 to 1975 is clearly &quot;history,&quot; however 1975 to 1995 might be viewed as &quot;legacy.&quot;  Phish is more clear, since they didn't get started until the 1980s, so I suppose that's &quot;legacy.&quot;  A bit problematic...any thoughts?[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:16, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

== Neo-Hippie movement ==

On The Movement: I still maintain that any author is going to have a tough time covering the modern (post 2000) Neo-Hippie movement selectively, as I did on the other dedicated page. It was difficult for myself to document new and verify old sources in all three attempted rewrites I tried over there; and I am one (both self described and secondarily labelled) myself. The modern movement, as it exists today, is intentionally decentralized and intertwined into other various &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; groups, from (at lest in the USA) the PDA to PETA to the American Communist Party, to Young Socialists. They (we) stay away from media coverage, and rarely use the label themselves. It's probably best to lightly cover the existence of a related movement of philosophy as it merged into other groups, rather than cover the group on its own, at this point. You just won't be able to source it if you try to cover the group on its own; it nearly dictates and demands OR rather than an existing field of coverage, despite it's large, behind the scenes activity. 

On Music: As I attempted to cover on the dedicated page; the standard stereotype music of hippies does not apply to the modern movement who has slowly expanded into acceptance of many other (though still non-mainstream) genres. There was a large? (427 people) hippie retreat at Bone Fest 07, which I attended. Those not familiar, Bone Fest is an annual show held in Mexico or the South-West US (with the exception of the one-time merge with Milwaukee Metalfest) focusing on new and up-n-coming death, dark, black, and doom metal bands, with the occasional addition of known groups. Though it's advertised by word of mouth only, for the most part, (which is the only direct connection it maintains to the style of olde), it still draws a fairly large crowd into the thousands each year, and always has a hippie retreat in attendance, though not related to the show itself. A most extreme case as it is, it does show that the movement has branched in interest ''way'' beyond rock-n-roll. 

Good luck to whoever takes on the task of doing the movement justice! [[User:Lostinlodos|Lostinlodos]] ([[User talk:Lostinlodos|talk]]) 05:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

== Etymology - TIME Magazine ==

TIME Magazine has very graciously put their entire back issues as far as 1924 online, and it is a true Time Capsule.  I did a [http://www.time.com/time/searchresults?D=hippie&amp;No=20&amp;sid=1175ED0E5E20&amp;Ntt=hippie&amp;Nr=OR%28p_record_type%3aOther%2cp_record_type%3ablog%2cp_record_type%3aArticle%29&amp;Ntk=WithBodyDate&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ns=p_date_sort%7c0&amp;N=0&amp;Nty=1 search for &quot;Hippie&quot;, sorted from oldest], and found very interesting results:

*All of the results (which also bring up hits for &quot;hippy) from 1924 through July, 1964 refer either to persons who actually have the surname &quot;hippie&quot;, or adjectivally to an attribute of (usually a woman's) hips.
*The reference for Nov. 27, 1964 seems suspiciously like it means a group of people, could this be an earlier reference than the Fallon article?
*The next reference, for Nov. 12, 1965, says in a play review ''&quot;William Goodhart converts a Greenwich Village loft into a sparring ground for the Establishment and the hippie, the parent and the child.&quot;'' This is certainly a reference to our hippies, but it seems to be predated by the September 5 1965, Fallon reference mentioned in the article.

:I cited the Andrew Lloyd Oldham liner notes to the Rolling Stones album as an earlier contemporary usage of the word &quot;hippie.&quot; Somebody (Viriditas) cited a reference that the September 1965 usage of &quot;hippie&quot; by Fallon was the first contemporary usage of the term, then Til cites an earlier reference from a 1964 Time magazine, and I cited the Feb. 1965 &quot;Rolling Stones Now!&quot; album liner notes as a reference. Then Viriditas deletes both of the those references, and claims that his reference is correct because it's a secondary source, while Til's and mine are primary. He says Wikipedia can't cite primary sources. This is absurd. The secondary source is wrong, and should not be used because the two primary sources that Til and I cited prove that Viriditas secondary source is wrong! The editor of an encyclopedia doesn't just blindly cite sources, he has to find out if the sources are valid and reliable. Just because something is in print doesn't mean it's usable, as it might be wrong. The Fallon reference clearly is. Our sources, whether primary or not, prove that it is, but each time we delete or change the Fallon ref, he immediately puts it back. Then you (Veritas) come on here telling me I can be blocked for edit wars? How absurd. Viriditas is the one who is warring. This whole talk page is nothing but a battleground between Viriditas and everybody else he's been at war with. Why don't you block him for reverting my and Til's correct citations? Also, the citation claims that Fallon &quot;came up with&quot; the term hippie, and in the same sentence it says there were earlier usages of the term. ABSURD!! You can't &quot;come up with&quot; a term that is already being used! And then he says there are many different meanings of the term hippie, and Fallon gives the first valid use of the contemporary usage. This is laughable! Everybody knows what a hippie is, except Viriditas, the guy who basically wrote the whole article. As I said before, the hippie article is an atrocity. It's really bad, and it's all because of Viriditas. Really. [[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] ([[User talk:Morgan Wright|talk]]) 00:27, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
::You cited your ''interpretation'' of the liner notes.  Now, all you have to do is find a good secondary source showing the use of the word in relation to the subculture and we're good to go.  Interpretating primary source materials is an ongoing problem which is why we rely on secondary sources.  Til's reference to a 1964 Time magazine article is again, a primary source for his claim.  We don't use sources in that way.  The word &quot;hippie&quot; was used to refer to different things as the etymology article makes clear. Based on the historical evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the beat movement moved from the East to the West Coast, and Doyle makes reference to John Gruen's 1964 article for the ''New York Herald Tribune'' titled &quot;The New Bohemia&quot; as one possible antecedent for the nascent hippie movement.  See?  No interpretation required.  We have sources, but the trick is figuring out what Doyle is saying.  Now, we can at this moment add that to the history subarticle, but what we are talking about here is etymology.  So we have sources to go on.  Find Gruen's original article (not the book published years later).  We already have a secondary source referring to it. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:43, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

:::Veritas is correct. The Feb 1965 use of the word hippie to describe the Rolling Stones (who are universally regarded to be contemporary hippies) prior to the September 1965 use by Fallon, invalidates that as a source. It's simply wrong. The Fallon citation is wrong and should be deleted. I don't care how many secondary sources back it up, they are all wrong. I'm sure I can find 100 sources saying the earth is flat. All it takes is one source to prove 100 other sources to be wrong, if they are wrong. Morgan Wright (talk) 13:55, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

::::Also, Viriditas needs to get off his San Francisco kick. If you start with a premise, that SF was the birthplace, and allow all evidence that backs up this premise, and dispute any reference to hippies outside SF as not being real hippies, then everything is based on the premise, and you are striving to prove your own premise. This is called a straw man argument. In this case, the premise is wrong, so the rest of it will be wrong. If you define hippies as a culture that started in SF, and then you say the Rolling Stones were not hippies because their manager was from London, and even though he used the term before there were references to hippies in SF, he must be talking about some other form of hippie because we already defined that as a culture from San Francisco. Do you see how wrong this argument is? Its circular logic.Morgan Wright (talk) 14:04, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
:::::This was discussed on your talk page, but not liking the answer you moved it here.  Please do not misrepresent Veritas or myself.  Veritas is remaining neutral and is not taking a position.  The word &quot;hippie&quot; was in use before it referred to the hippie subculture.  Read [[Hippie (etymology)]].  Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334. ISBN 0893569828; Stevens 1998, pp. 299-300; Tompkins 2001, vol. 7: 1960-1969.  Now, all you have to do is find ''one'' that refers to the Rolling Stones.  The addition of McCleary's &quot;numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word&quot; is a great start in the right direction.  The next step is to find sources for additional theories.  I recommend using the library.  Good luck. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 20:59, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

This is the paragraph that is being called original research.  Given the date of the quote, as the word was already in fact being used &quot;in print&quot; in Malcolm X' autobiography before then, the contect is provided and is self evident.

:That's not correct.  The Malcolm X reference is supported by a reliable secondary source that places the usage in the context of the hippie subculture and cannabis use.  The TIME Magazine usage that you have added is based on your ''personal perusal'' of the TIME archives (as you explain above) and your interpretation of the word in the context of the hippie subculture, rather than the [[Hippie (etymology)]] article itself.  Unless you can show how your ''original research'' is supported by a secondary source in the context of the hippie subculture, then it doesn't belong in this article.

:::Where can I find a reliable secondary source that states that &quot;The more contemporary sense of the word &quot;hippie&quot; first appeared in US print on November 27, 1964&quot;.  We cannot cite ''you'' as the source.  As the hippie etymology article makes clear, the word was used in many ways.  There is no indication it was used to refer to the hippie subculture in TIME, and in order to use it in this article, you would have to find a secondary source that says it is.  That's how ''every'' source in the article is used.  If you can find one that isn't, then it should be removed.  The fact is, before you began inserting OR, the section originally read: &quot;The more contemporary sense of the word &quot;hippie&quot; first appeared in print on September 5, 1965, in the article, &quot;A New Haven for Beatniks&quot;, by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn coffeehouse, using the term &quot;hippie&quot; to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from North Beach into the Haight-Ashbury district. Fallon reportedly came up with the name by transforming Norman Mailer's use of the word &quot;hipster&quot; into &quot;hippie&quot;.[23] Use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; did not catch on in the mass media until early 1967, after San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen began referring to &quot;hippies&quot; in his daily columns&quot;.[24][25]  All fully sourced and supported by multiple secondary sources.  You altered the material to insert original research that is ''not'' supported.

Hi, the problem with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippie&amp;diff=184364250&amp;oldid=184363391 this edit] is that it replaced a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] which stated the date of the first occurrence in print referring to &quot;hippie&quot;, with a source using the word &quot;hippie&quot; that a Wikipedia editor believes predates the debut date given by the existing secondary source. Til may or may not be factually correct (we don't actually know the complete context of the usage of &quot;hippie&quot;), but it is indeed [[WP:OR|original research]] for an editor to replace what a secondary source states with a personal observation.  Still, the ''Time'' article is an interesting find, there are other ways to perhaps approach this.  It could somehow still be mentioned, minus the editor-declaration that it is the first occurrence of contemporary usage in print (unless a secondary source can be found that states such).  Meanwhile, we shouldn't remove the existing sourced statement giving the September 1965 article as the first usage in print, even if it appears to conflict with an editor's personal observation. --[[User:MPerel|&lt;font color=&quot;#330000&quot;&gt;M&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#334400&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#338800&quot;&gt;er&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#33cc00&quot;&gt;el &lt;/font&gt;]] 01:53, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

#&quot;That obscure neighborhood known as the Haight-Ashbury got some unaccustomed press attention in September.  On the sixth the ''San Francisco Examiner'' ran a story titled 'A New Haven for Beatniks.'  (In the text, however, the locals were referred to as hippies.)&quot; Perry, Charles. (2005).  ''The Haight-Ashbury: A History''. Wenner Books. p. 19. ISBN 193295855X
#&quot;Writing in September 1965 in the San Francisco Examiner under a heading &quot;A New Haven for Beatniks&quot;, Michael Fallon used for the first time the word &quot;hippie&quot; (derived from Norman Mailer's term &quot;hipsters&quot; in reference to the Beats) to describe the scene growing around a Haight-Ashbury coffee house, the Blue Unicorn on 1927 Hayes Street.&quot;  Sinclair, Mick.  (2004) ''San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History''. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649. 
#&quot;The hippies did not pick that name for themselves: it was given to them by Michael Fallon, a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, in a 1965 story about the new bohemian lifestyle that was developing in the city's Haight-Ashbury district (named for two streets that converge there—also called the Haight). Fallon got the name by shortening Norman Mailer's term hipster, and he applied it to the second generation of beatniks who had moved into the Haight from nearby North Beach.&quot; Tompkins, Vincent, ed. (2001), &quot;Hippies&quot;, American Decades, vol. 7: 1960-1969, Detroit: Thomson Gale.
#Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). ''The Sixties in America''.  Salem Press.  p. 334. ISBN 0893569828
#&quot;...by the time the ''Examiner'' tumbled to what was happening [The Haight] supported a thriving bohemian community, of which the Unicorn was the heart and soul.  This, then, was the gist of what journalist Michael Fallon had to report to his readers...Fallon's first instinct was to give it a name, which he did by borrowing Norman Mailer's hipster and contracting it into hippie...at the time of Fallon's article, there were probably only a dozen houses scarttered throughout the Haight that could have been characterized as hippie.&quot; Stevens, Jay (1998), Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream, Grove Press, ISBN 0802135870. pp. 299-300. 
#&quot;The term &quot;hippie,&quot; which seems to have been coined in late 1965, was quite obscure even into 1967; it does not appear in such pioneering books on the new dissident culture as J. L. Simmons and Barry Winograd's It's Happening and John Gruen's The New Bohemia (both published in 1966). By mid-1967, however, everyone knew who hippies were. The 1966-67 Reader's Guide has no entry for &quot;hippie&quot;; the 1967-68 volume has over a column of them. In sum, it would seem fair to conclude that the cultural phenomenon of the hippies began to take on clear, distinguishing characteristics about 1966 and was widely familiar to the general public by the following year.&quot;  [[Timothy Miller|Miller, Timothy]]. &quot;[http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/root1.html Roots of Communal Revival 1962-1966]&quot;.

#See &quot;support for other sources&quot; in the next section below for Doyle's reference to a 1964 article by John Gruen in the ''New York Herald Tribune''.  This doesn't support TIME but instead offers a contemporaneous event cited by a tertiary source.  It is unclear if Gruen actually used the word &quot;hippie&quot; - Timothy Miller says he doesn't, so there is some confusion here.  Howard Brick, in ''Age of Contradiction: American Thought and Culture in the 1960s'', acknowledges Gruen, observing that the beats had become the &quot;new bohemians&quot; by 1964, but like [[Peter Tamony]], Brick doesn't fully acknowledge the hippies (or ignores them) until 1966.  Tamony sees the Trips Festival event (Jan. 21-23, 1966) as the catalyst for solidifying the word ''hippie'', a &quot;term with multiple connotations into the national vocabularly.&quot;  Interestngly, Tamony mentions that he first heard the word ''trip'' in 1964, which dovetails with Leary and Alpert's experiments at Millbrook that same year (noted by Doyle and Brick).

*Michael Doyle [http://www.bsu.edu/history/profile/0,1966,4832-887-56179,00.html] posits the evolution and emergence of proto-hippies (&quot;new bohemians&quot;) on the East Coast as early as 1963, which then spreads to the West Coast by 1965. Doyle claims that John Gruen used the word &quot;hippie&quot; in an article for the ''New York Herald Tribune'' titled &quot;The New Bohemia&quot; (later turned into a 1966 book), but it is unclear if Doyle is speaking literally or figuratively.

I gave up on editing the Hippie article long ago when it became clear that the article was a solo project by Viriditas, and anything added to it by other editors would be promptly deleted by him. How amazing that almost a year later, I come back and find more of the same. Viriditas is painting the picture that hippies first existed in San Francisco, and any reference to them outside SF must be removed. This is the problem with the etymology dispute, as the Fallon reference is the earliest reference to San Francisco hippies, and the earlier citations involve London, England and a small town in Connecticut. Obviously those can't be &quot;comtemporary&quot; usages of the modern hippie, since they do not refer to genuine San Francisco hippies. Earth to Veriditas, the hippie movement DID NOT START in San Francisco, and these earlier usages of the term outside SF are valid. I am the one who first added the 1965 Rolling Stones Now! reference, in the liner notes to the album, which is a more valid reference because the Stones sold a million copies of the album. By comparison, virtually NOBODY has ever heard of this Fallon character. You know what I think? I think all those San Francisco hippies in 1965 got the term from the Stones album! It came out in February, 1965, before the Fallon reference, and all those SF hippies listened to the Stones. The Stones album is probably a more valid source of the term, and quite obviously, it is a &quot;contemporary usage&quot; of the term, since the Stones themselves were hippies, so maybe the term was being used in London before it was being used in San Francisco.[[User:Morgan Wright|Morgan Wright]] ([[User talk:Morgan Wright|talk]]) 22:52, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

== Quoting TIME  Magazine as a reference. ==

First of all, the article already uses TIME magazine as a primary source reference, because TIME did several in depth studies on the contemporary phenomenon of hippies during the 1960s.  November 1964 was only the first of many such references. 

When the article states ''&quot;Use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; did not catch on in the mass media until early 1967, after San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen began referring to &quot;hippies&quot; in his daily columns&quot;'' this is just plain disinformation.

== Possible resolution of the conflict re: use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; ==

I've made a few changes; please see what you think of them.

The essence of the conflict, it seems to me, has to do with early appearances of the term &quot;hippie&quot; versus the first use of the term in the context of a developing subculture that had gained a certain momentum by late 1965.

I see no problem mentioning early appearances of the term, before &quot;hippie&quot; developed its contemporary meaning as it relates to a distinct subculture.  The interpretive literature seems to favor Fallon as being the first to use &quot;hippie&quot; in this sense.

While &quot;Time&quot; may have used the term &quot;hippie&quot; early on in an isolated article, that does not mean the term had &quot;(caught) on in the mass media.&quot;  Various sources credit Herb Caen for getting that going, since he had the opportunity to do so on a daily basis--hippies were, after all, interesting subjects for his daily columns.  I have substituted &quot;did not become widespread in the mass media&quot; for &quot;did not catch on in the mass media&quot; in hopes of making more clear the progression from obscure usage to common usage.

Hope this resolves things somewhat.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 22:31, 21 January 2008 (UTC)
:Thank you for your time, but it doesn't resolve anything, and I'm removing the challenged, disputed material to talk.  If you want to address the questions I've raised above, starting with providing secondary sources, I would be happy to discuss it.  If you are going to mention, trivial early appearances of the term, then you need to be prepared to source them in the etymology article.  We don't do trivia on Wikipedia, but important trivia should be easy to source.  We also don't do original research, such as digging around magazine archives and album covers to try and promote an idea without secondary sources for that interpretation.  As it stands, the mention of TIME and the Rolling Stones is unsourced trivia.  I have challenged the relevance of the material (since the etymology article makes it clear that the term was already in use prior to it being used to apply to the subculture) and I expect to see reliable sources offered for its inclusion.

== Hippie Dictionary ==

Til Eulenspiegel added the following material:

''As lexicographer John McCleary writes in ''The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s'': &quot;Actually, the counterculture seldom called itself ''hippies''; it was the media and straight society who popularized the term. Most often, we called ourselves ''[[Freak scene|freaks]]'' or ''heads''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hippie Dictionary'' by John McCleary p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;''

I think this should be in the article, and in the past I've added similar material only to have it removed by others, but I'm glad Til Eulenspiegel has returned to bring this to our attention yet again.  First of all, nobody refers to McCleary as a lexicographer, nor does he seem to refer to himself as such; he has published previous books dealing with photography and local color, which is why ''Newsweek'' in a review of his book, calls him a &quot;photojournalist&quot;.[http://www.newsweek.com/id/54372]  So we need to just deal with the cited material.  As someone who has owned the book, it's less of a dictionary and more of a running commentary on hippie words, values, and culture.  It is interesting to note that McCleary subscribes to the Fallon origin theory, and quotes it in full without  referring to Fallon's name.  I suggest adding it back in with an emphasis on what McCleary actually wrote:

:::hippie a member of a counterculture that began to appear in the early 1960s and expressed a moral rejection of the established society.  Derived from the word hip, meaning roughly &quot;in the know,&quot; or &quot;aware.&quot;  The true hippie believes in and works for truth, generosity, peace, love, and tolerance.  The messengers of sanity in a world filled with greed, intolerance, and war.  Numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word.  One of the most credible involves the beatniks, who abandoned North Beach, San Francisco, to flee commercialism in the early 1960s.  many of them moved to the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, where they were idolized and emulated by the young university students who lived in the neighborhood.  The beats (the hip people) started calling these students hippies, or younger versions of themselves.  Actually, the counterculture seldom called itself hippies; it was the media and straight society who popularized the term.  Move often, we called ourselves freaks or heads.  Not until later did we begin calling ourselves hippies, and by then we were &quot;aging hippies&quot;.  An alternate spelling seldom used in the United States by people in the know was hippy, but was spelled that way in England.

We've been tiptoeing around this topic for years.  Drug use by hippies could develop into its own article, so I'm surprised this hasn't been expanded.  In the past, I've added content about cannabis use, but it was removed by another editor.  I would like to hear suggestions on where to go with this, and hope others can contribute.

: Well, it would be a hard one to do, since so much of the information out there is simply derogatory yellow journalism filled with falsehoods. Not to say it's not worth the work to sort it out, but it would be quite a job. Important points might be the relationship between the psychedelic movement/experience and the hippie movement (and the whole idea of &quot;raising consciousness&quot;), the pervasiveness of cannabis use, the contrast between the &quot;back to nature&quot; current and the use of &quot;artificial&quot; chemicals, the attempts (with mixed results) of hippies to police themselves concerning what was then called &quot;hard drugs&quot; and abuse vs use (the rejection by the majority of hippies of heroin, cocaine, and &quot;needle-drugs&quot;, the &quot;speed kills&quot; initiative, the acid hot-lines and care stations at rock concerts, the free clinic (and other) testing services for drug content and purity, etc), and issues like the advent of paraquat, drug cuts that were worse than the drug, and when the drug war was more harmful than drug use itself. In fact, it might be better to create a short article and expand it into the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; article or something.

:: I'm game, though I won't have much time to think about it until after March 2nd. The key to the use of &quot;consciousness-expanding&quot; drugs among the hippies, IMO, is that though there is nothing new about a sub-culture exploring consciousness through drug-induced altered states of consciousness (or induced by any other means, for that matter), it had never been a massive youth movement throughout the known world before. Usually, such practices were limited to a fringe group of mystics, cultists, secret-society members, some sort of priesthood, an artistic community, or some other group divorced from the mainstream. Sometimes this was considered disreputable or even illegal (like opium dens and absinthe users), other times it was applauded and expected of those individuals (like medicine men, oracles and shamans). But never before was it seen as a potential wave of the future and part of a social revolution, the way psychedelia was seen by millions before illegalization, and depicted in major magazines, movies and other media. [[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 19:33, 10 February 2008 (UTC)
:::Thanks, that helps.  The economic aspects are important too.  In a hippie community like the Haight, many sources describe cannabis dealing  as a legitimate (or viable) profession.  I'm sure this is true for other enclaves as well.  I'm not as sure about LSD, but the Brotherhood's network probably provided jobs.  So rather than seeing the  stereotype of violent, greeedy, and corrupt drug dealers, there appears to have been a stable culture supporting this lifestyle.  Some kind of change occurred in the late 1960s, with the prohibiton of LSD (many forget that it was once legal) and the introduction and availability of harder drugs and the crackdown on cannabis (you allude to it above).

This is not unusual in any subculture; a black market becomes an integral part of the socio-economic structure, and often the only source of revenue to a group that is excluded from operation and upward mobility in the &quot;legitimate&quot; economic world. Among hippies, this ranged from selling hash pipes and roach clips to clandestine private investigators specializing in finding runaways, doctors supplying medical deferments for draft dodgers, drug smugglers, free (and not so free) clinics, hostels, etc. There were way too many kids flooding the Haight to survive begging for spare change; just like Woodstock, the sheer unexpected numbers overwhelmed the original vision.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 16:13, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:: Fair enough but, while it may have not been Leary's intention - the reality was that the phrase became a rallying point for hedonistic drug consumption worldwide. That could be a good way of introducing the topic. BTW, it's a primary source I know, but there is Michael Hollingshead's book ''The Man Who Turned On The World'', in which he describes how he introduced Leary to LSD..

::: Ok. Well, In a passage describing a 1965 visit to Berkeley with Leary Hollingshead observes that a strong element of hippie philosophy was a changing regard of Providence - as an internal rather external source of human development.''&quot;Odd, really, how quickly the young respond to change. Whilst only seven or eight years ago the style was teeth-and-tweeds, button-down shirts and college ties, the mode of dress now veered on the far side of informality—jeans, denim shirts, cowboy boots and Afghan coats; and beards and long hair were everywhere prevalent. It was as if one psychic atmosphere had spread from California to Italy. Millions of similar people everywhere in the West. And their lifestyle was loose, unstructured; they seemed to roll on like the waves, whose movement is regulated by invisible forces emanating from the moon. They were beings who were in possession of a secret which provided the impetus to their lives; their aims were more inward; they had a feeling for values; they had achieved a certain level of consciousness. Were they not somehow more open than in any age previously, which gave them this new amplitude and a sense of purpose? And if you were to ask them, 'What for the future?' it is to themselves they would point. What folly to believe in a Providence which guides life from the outside! This is the change in itself. Where growth is guided by conscious volition, development of the personality takes place; everyone progresses, marches onward, further and further, and no end is in sight. Here was a new generation for whom time is real before eternity.&quot;'' Consciousness raising was thus paramount. A little below I do see him quoting Leary as saying ''&quot;'The yoga of drugs is of course a key method.&quot;'' [http://web.archive.org/web/20030505124927/www.drugtext.org/library/psylib/holl9.htm].

:I've been responding to comments. Only now did I just actually read the Drugs section. It covers the above point pretty well. I've stuck in a fact tag on the Stonehenge 'heroin' thing. In that regard I saw Leary speak once in the early 90s and he divided drugs into political classes. Cannabis and LSD were 'democratic' drugs, while heroin and cocaine were 'republican'. I think the section reads well but could be expanded and a couple of other key influences included such as Aldous Huxley and even Lewis Carroll. The progress of emphasis from mind expansion to hedonism could be remarked. It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation as to whether drugs led to hippies, or hippies turned to drugs. Myself I tend to go with the former - hence my intuitive reversal of Leary's dictum above. [[User:Wwwhatsup|Wwwhatsup]] ([[User talk:Wwwhatsup|talk]]) 16:45, 13 February 2008 (UTC)
::Good edits and nice comments.  Someone snuck that OR in and you caught it; I would just go ahead and remove it, but I always find it helpful if the editor removing content (that isn't obvious vandalism) takes the time to place it on the talk page with a brief comment explaining the removal.  Keep in mind, not all hippies were hedonists; some practiced [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] in the Buddhist tradition, and I think the hippie flight out of the cities and back to the land was a form of urban asceticism.  Living simply in small, isolated communities doesn't seem to be altogether focused on the pleasure and happiness of the individual, but rather that of the group.  In fact, I would argue that [[communalism]] is quite difficult, as is finding your true self, getting in touch with your inner being, etc.  Viewing hippies as hedonists seems a bit too superficial, but that's just my take on it.  I'm sure you'll get a dozen different opinions. :)  As for drugs leading to hippies, I think we are really talking about ''bohemianism'' at its core; since bohemians lived unconventionally, drugs were generally an accepted part of that culture, in some form or another.  I think there is something to be said for the influence of cannabis (its use by the [[beat generation]] and their influence on the hippies) but very few (if any) authors have tackled this conundrum.  There is something unique to cannabis that sets it apart from any other drug; it has the dual reputation (and some would say ''mythological'' stature) of helping artists to create and [[hashshashin]] to kill;  perhaps this does come down to set and setting, and the drug only reflects the state of mind of the initiate.  But a glance at the article shows the myths in full force: Dylan got The Beatles stoned, etc.  Even Martin Booth in ''Cannabis: A History'' (2004) touches upon the Jazz musician myth: it is said that the best Jazz music was invented in between marathon cannabis [[sesshin]]s.  So I think we are dealing in the realm of [[mythmaking]], because the mind seeks out explanations; one could argue that the [[Free Speech Movement]] was the center of the cyclone, and before it the Civil Rights Movement, and before it...ad infinitum.  There is no one explanation, no way to point and say, &quot;see, there it is&quot;, because we are not dealing with a physical thing, but rather [[meme]]s.  I always thought that Hunter S. Thompson's description of &quot;the thing&quot; as a &quot;wave&quot; was the closest anyone came to pointing in the right direction. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 09:01, 14 February 2008 (UTC)
::: I can't take responsibility for any edits. Someone else's work.  I have an idea of how the section might flow. Hippies inherit druggie mind expansion from bohemians. Hedonistic cannabis &amp; LSD use becomes widespread. While Aquarian types tend to move to increasingly ascetic rural communes, urban hipsters move onto speed and cocaine and dadaistic revolutionary politics. Don't ask me for references  but surely Hoffman and Rubin say something. My own experience - I am British - was that a prime factor in the UK was the arrival of immigrants from Jamaica and Pakistan in the late 50's/early 60's bringing cannabis culture with them.  In the 70s I attended a performance by an American eccentric called Nick Shoumatoff at the ICA in London. In it he told a story. He came to Oxford University in the late 50s, sharing lodgings with Jamaicans who introduced him to hashish. He made friends with Steve Abrams, a protegé of [[Jung]] who knew Huxley. Shoumatoff went to Morocco on summer break and returned with a sleeping bag full of kif. He and Abrams set about turning on their fellows. A band was formed called The Black Arabs and wild parties ensued. It was probably at one of these where the young Bill C. declined to inhale. Members of the coterie moved to London in the early 60s and began [[UK underground|countercultural institutions]] such as [[Indica Gallery|Indica]] that spawned hippie culture in the UK, and particularly influenced the Beatles.  All thoroughly anecdotal and unencyclopedic I know, but I think it illustrates my theme that drug taking by bohemian intellectuals begat the hippie 'wave'. I did start an article on [[Release (agency)|Release]]. In July 1967 an Abrams-organized full page [http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/TimesAd.html cannabis legalization ad] in [[The Times]] was signed by The Beatles and financed by McCartney. That's pretty well documented.  [[User:Wwwhatsup|Wwwhatsup]] ([[User talk:Wwwhatsup|talk]]) 10:36, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

I would really like to get the [[Swinging London]] hippies into this and the history article, but I've been having trouble finding sources in the states.  Since libraries often archive culture-related news-clippings by subject in special collections, I'm certain that one can find hippie-era archives in the UK.  Would you be willing to look into this?

== Neo-Hippie ==

I challenge whether there is any such thing as a Neo-Hippie, separate from just being a Hippie. It seems to be a made-up word used by people who don't realize that hippies still exist and, though the hippie movement is not by any means the wide-spread popular youth movement it was in the sixties, it never really went away. There have been subsequent Woodstocks and other festivals (some listed in this article), tie-dyes and other fashions associated with hippies are still produced, concerts and recordings in the Jam Band genre' of music (and other subsets of alternative rock, folk rock, folk music, world music etc) are still popular, certain icons like [[Wavy Gravy]], [[Harvey Wasserman]] and [[Stephen Gaskin]] &amp; [[Ina May Gaskin]] still write and make public appearances, and many companies and organizations from Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream to Plenty International, the Rex Foundation, and [[Hunger International]] still carry the same spirit on. Neo-Hippie, on the other hand, seems to have very little that uses the term to self-describe, nor is there much that's significant that comes up in a google search. Thoughts? [[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 19:26, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

:Agreed. The term is meaningless. Recall, though, that the Diggers buried the hippie in San Francisco following the summer of love. So in a sense all hippies after that rose out of those ashes, so to speak. 

:I have never heard anyone, at any time, in any place describe himself or herself as a &quot;neo-hippie.&quot;  Kind of a made-up term that never gained any traction.  I see no reason for it to appear in any Wikipedia article. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 18:27, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:Which brings to mind that somehow we've lost the account of the burial. It had been in the article, but is gone now. To my mind it is hard to overestimate the significance of that event for the movement. [[User:Sunray|Sunray]] ([[User talk:Sunray|talk]]) 02:56, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

::: I agree that it was an important moment that should be included; however, the Diggers didn't own the hippie movement and were never empowered to end it. Stephen Gaskin, for instance, never recognized an end to the movement; The Farm is still &quot;America's biggest hippie commune&quot;, and he still lists &quot;hippie&quot; as his religion whenever asked on a form. Many organizations and companies refered and refer to themselves with the word hippie decades after the burial. It did, however, mark a turnng point in the popularity of the movement, and as great a disillusionment as Watergate was for American politics. But American politics and the GOP continue, and there are still hippies doing what hippies do.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 16:23, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

::::The point the Diggers were making (and one that resounded in the media) was that the image of &quot;the hippie&quot; had become a media plaything, hyped beyond all recognition and subject to endless manipulation.

:: A couple of comments, neither totally pertinent. 1) Diggers: In a [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6540905926032767614 BBC Documentary] on psychedelics, Microsoft founder Bob Wallace talks of the influence of LSD culture on the development of personal computing. Specifically he questions whether it could have ever developed with out the shareware ethos. Although not mentioned specifically surely that is essential digger philosophy. So the irony is that their ethic on some ways outlived the movement and thrives today in everything from  open source, free software, P2P to, bless us, Wikipedia.  2) Death:  In the analogous case of punk rock - In 1977 Mark Perry declared punk dead the day The Clash signed to CBS.  Perry's point was that punk as defined by mass market products &amp; media was no longer alternative and thus no longer essentially punk. That death in fact signified it's birth as a mass cultural phenomenon.  [[User:Wwwhatsup|Wwwhatsup]] ([[User talk:Wwwhatsup|talk]]) 11:01, 14 February 2008 (UTC)
:::Regarding the counterculture and personal computing, see also: ''[[What the Dormouse Said]]'' (2005) and ''[[Fred Turner (academic)|From Counterculture to Cyberculture]]'' (2006).  And as far as the death of the hippies/punks, I seem to recall Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters having something to say about the naming of things, which they seem to have stolen from a Buddhist philosopher or two; by naming the thing (&quot;hippie&quot;, &quot;punk&quot;, whatever) we are removing ourselves from the direct experience.

== Culture of psychedelics ==

What influence - if any - did psychedelic drug use have on the art and music produced by the hippie counterculture?  This all seems very familiar.  The indigenous [[Huichol]] people of Mexico use [[peyote]] in their religious rituals.  Is it a coincidence that the [[Huichol#Art|art of the Huichol]] makes use of fluorescent colors and psychedelic designs, reminiscent of hippie [[tie-dye]] and [[day-glo]] colors used by the Merry Pranksters?  What was the role of [[psychedelic art]] in hippie culture?  Is it conceivable that those who experimented with an [[altered state of consciousness]] through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs, were motivated to recreate this experience during normal waking consciousness, resulting in a cultural explosion influencing every aspect of reality, and manifesting pure imagination?  Was LSD the catalyst for the new forms of music, literature, art and fashion? &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 11:18, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

== Expressing my concerns again ==

Too much of this article is devoted to the Family Dog, and I suspect there are COI reasons for demanding that such a broad article be focused on such a small aspect of this history.  I'm going to ask Apostle12 to ''once again'' consider moving non-essential elements out of this article and into the [[history of the hippie movement]]. I'm also concerned about the statement, &quot;Some of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at San Francisco State College who were intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene and left school after they started taking psychedelic drugs.[33]&quot;  I've studied this issue and don't see any support for the claim that they &quot;left school after they started taking psychedelic drugs&quot; which is linked to reference 33, attributed to the opinion of a non-historian, Bill Ham, a light engineer, on both his website and in the past, by a an interpretation of a primary source (a film).  Unless a transcript of this is produced, showing these particular words, or a link to Bill Ham's words on his website, I'm going to remove it.  If those two things are produced, then we will compare them to what notable historians say on the subject. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 00:37, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
:To date I haven't done anything with this because it's not clear to me what you would like to see.  Is it, for example, the Family Dog aspect or the Red Dog Saloon material that you object to?  Or both?  The two are linked, of course, in the sense that the Family Dog came into existence following the summer that participants spent at the Red Dog Saloon.  My only desire is that the connections between the various events be established in the article, since those connections were so seminal to what became the hippie experience--not sure how this could be considered a &quot;conflict of interest.&quot;  (For the record, I did know a few of the people involved, but the Red Dog predated my involvement and I had nothing to do with the Family Dog.)
:In order to write the section on the Berkeley coffee houses, Chandler Laughlin's creation of a &quot;tribal identity,&quot; the Red Dog Saloon, the Family Dog and the rest, I spent most of a day watching and re-watching the film to make sure I got it right.  Simply don't have the time to rent it again and prepare a transcript.

Many of my parents' upper-middle-class Berkeley friends (Berkeley professors and, especially, the research chemists and physicists working at the Rad Lab) had taken LSD and were enthused.  Also I had done some research and had read much of what Leary and Alpert had written about LSD.  One night my friend Chopin and I were bored, and we remembered that there was a jar in the fridge containing 3,000 capsules of White Lightning, which my girlfriend was storing for her friend Owsley.  After that evening, I returned to classes and none of it seemed &quot;relevant&quot; (remember that favored 60's word); the Vietnam War was beginning to rage, and that evening turned my attention to other matters that seemed much more important.

Many of the college offerings were over-intellectualized and seemed irrevelant to these people; they came to favor a more direct, experiential approach to life.  They left college because they lost interest.  That's not the same as saying &quot;psychedelics caused people to drop out of college.&quot;  The Red Dog/Family Dog initiators and early participants were mostly people in the 25-35 age range who had &quot;dropped out&quot; (meaning they had disassociated themselves from the &quot;straight&quot; world) long before; I can't think of anyone who was a college student.  Yet many of those who joined the party once it got going in the Haight were former college students who lost interest in school. And a lot of those came from San Francisco State, especially Gaskin's crowd since that was where he taught.  Always nice to get it right, but as I've said before, I have no real stake in this, since I don't think it's an important point.

== The &quot;Hippie&quot; scene and dropping out of college ==

Okay, I made some changes so that this section (discussed above) no longer implies that S.F.S.C. students dropped out of college because they took psychedelic drugs.  This topic does deserve some discussion in the article, however, because so many young people who were influenced by the developing hippie ethos left school after concluding it had little to offer them.  Their view of life and their priorities changed radically due to many factors:
* the collective experience of living apart from parents for the first time with an unprecedented number of relatively affluent young people
* occasional, yet intense, pyschedelic experiences that caused one to question the values and priorities of one's parents--as Bob Weir has written, most hippies did not spend a great deal of time &quot;stoned,&quot; yet the time so spent was transformative
* collective angst regarding the tragedy of the Vietnam War, and the large divide (at least until 1968) that generally existed between young people and their parents with respect to this issue
* the easy availability of birth control and (in many areas, even pre Roe v. Wade) abortion
* THE MUSIC!
* THE PARTIES!
* THE SCENE!
The importance and attraction of dry, often over-intellectualized college courses faded by comparison.  Many young people were just hungry to experience life, and there didn't seem to be enough time both to live fully and to attend school.  So they dropped out.

Yablonsky has written about this to some extent in ''The Hippie Trip''.  I'll try to get some of it into the article as time allows. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 00:04, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

== The Red Dog Saloon and the Family Dog as they influenced the hippie ethos ==

:During this period Cambridge, Massachusetts, Greenwich Village in New York City, and Berkeley, California, anchored the American folk music circuit. Berkeley's two coffee houses, the Cabale Creamery and the Jabberwock, sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting. In April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III, co-founder of the Cabale Creamery, established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all-night Native American peyote ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the Red Dog Saloon in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada.

:In the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene. He and his cohorts created what became known as &quot;The Red Dog Experience&quot;, featuring previously unknown musical acts—Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Charlatans, The Grateful Dead and others—who played in the completely refurbished, intimate setting of Virginia City's Red Dog Saloon. There was no clear delineation between &quot;performers&quot; and &quot;audience&quot; in &quot;The Red Dog Experience&quot;, during which music, psychedelic experimentation, a unique sense of personal style and Bill Ham's first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community. Laughlin and George Hunter of the Charlatans were true &quot;proto-hippies&quot;, with their long hair, boots and outrageous clothing of distinctly American (and Native American) heritage. LSD manufacturer Owsley Stanley lived in Berkeley during 1965 and provided much of the LSD that became a seminal part of the &quot;Red Dog Experience&quot;, the early evolution of psychedelic rock and budding hippie culture. At the Red Dog Saloon, The Charlatans were the first psychedelic rock band to play live (albeit unintentionally) loaded on LSD.

:When they returned to San Francisco, Red Dog participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called &quot;The Family Dog.&quot; Modeled on their Red Dog experiences, on October 16, 1965, the Family Dog hosted &quot;A Tribute to Dr. Strange&quot; at Longshoreman's Hall. Attended by approximately 500 of the Bay Area's original &quot;hippies&quot;, this was San Francisco's first psychedelic rock performance, costumed dance and light show, featuring Jefferson Airplane, The Great Society and The Marbles. Two other events followed before year's end, one at California Hall and one at the Matrix. After the first three Family Dog events, a much larger psychedelic event occurred at San Francisco's Longshoreman's Hall. Called &quot;The Trips Festival&quot;, it took place on January 21–January 23, 1966, and was organized by Stewart Brand, Ken Kesey, Owsley Stanley and others. Ten thousand people attended this sold-out event, with a thousand more turned away each night. On Saturday January 22, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company came on stage, and 6,000 people arrived to imbibe punch spiked with LSD and to witness one of the first fully-developed light shows of the era.

:By February 1966, the Family Dog became Family Dog Productions under organizer Chet Helms, promoting happenings at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore Auditorium in initial cooperation with Bill Graham. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience. Bill Ham, who had pioneered the original Red Dog light shows, perfected his art of liquid light projection, which combined light shows and film projection and became synonymous with the San Francisco ballroom experience. The sense of style and costume that began at the Red Dog Saloon flourished when San Francisco's Fox Theater went out of business and hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms. As San Francisco Chronicle music columnist Ralph J. Gleason put it, &quot;They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form.&quot;

Here are the three paragraphs in question.  Believe it or not, my intention during the original writing was to condense the story as much as possible while still making clear the progression from the traditional &quot;beat/folk&quot; scene, to the Red Dog, to the Family Dog, to &quot;The Tribute to Dr. Strange&quot; (the first public dance in modern San Francisco history), then to the Avalon and Fillmore events and the eventual flowering of full-blown hippie culture.  As Bob Weir has written, we were pretty much unaware that our numbers had grown to the critical mass required for self-identity as a group prior to the &quot;Tribute to Dr. Strange&quot; event.  Then our freak/hippie identity began to be adopted by more and more people.  

I am somewhat in doubt what might best be eliminated.  To be honest, I would prefer there not be a separate &quot;History of the hippie movement article&quot; because co-ordinating the edits between the two is so tricky.  

Since I wrote most of the above, and I was condensing as I wrote, every word was carefully chosen to eliminate anything I thought was extraneous to telling the story. So why don't you tell me what you think is too detailed and we can work on it here.  [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 03:24, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
:Look, we are going to have to agree to disagree on this.  I feel that I understand your position, and in some ways I support it, but this is pure &quot;history&quot; and should be discussed in the history of the hippie movement article.  Take a look at the articles contained within [[:Category:Subcultures]] to see how articles about subcultures are handled.  Unfortunately, there is currently no way to sort the category by FA/GA articles, so you will just have to look around.  My approach may be to blame for some of this miscommunication, because I am taking a big picture approach.  A lot of the Red Dog Saloon and Family Dog material has more to do with music of the counterculture and the development of rock concerts.  I know there is a lot of overlap, and that can't be avoided, but I would like for us to concentrate on the hippies themselves. I know you dislike the use of a subarticle on history, but it's just going to keep growing.  Take a look at [[Hip hop culture]] to see how they successfully manage splitting the topic into multiple articles.  Anyway, I'm not done addressing this.  I'm glad you created a new section to discuss it. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 08:37, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

:::Just an example of condensing text down to essentials and moving the rest to linked subarticles where people can find more information.  &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 09:06, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
::::I realize you were working quickly in order to provide an example.  However a lot of error made its way into your condensed version, and I think some of the omissions are important--your attempt to isolate &quot;hippies&quot; from the &quot;history of the hippies&quot; seems quite artificial to me because hippies came and went so quickly.  The act of becoming determined who and what hippies were.  I don't think the hippie phenomenon was comparable to hip hop.
::::To begin with, the April 1963 &quot;event&quot; did not happen at the Red Dog Saloon.  I would have to verify the location with Chan since I didn't attend it, but it probably took place on the reservation at Pyramid Lake, just north of Reno, Nevada, which was where I attended a similar event in December 1965.  In the &quot;Rockin' at the Red Dog&quot; film Chan speaks at some length about the genesis of this event, which found its inspiration in his developing awareness of nuclear vulnerability during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.  The peyote ceremony I attended was conducted in a traditional teepee under the auspices of the Native American Church; this and the previous ceremony (more were to come) were some the first links formed between budding hippie culture and Native American culture.
::::Sandoz acid was legally available at the time, though its distribution was limited, and thus controlled.   Peyote was more easily available and offered a similar shortcut to transcendent states.  As local LSD manufacturers developed their production techniques, LSD became the &quot;drug of choice&quot; for those seeking such a shortcut.  Even during the Red Dog's wildest days, the seed of reverence that was planted during the April 1963 peyote ceremony continued to grow and flourish, eventually finding its way via the Family Dog into developing hippie culture.
::::Now I don't expect much of this to find its way into the article, but it would be nice if ALL the good stuff didn't get boiled out. You have done that to much of the rest of the article, which I find sad.  Given your incessant demands for sourcing, your assumption that you are the final arbiter of what is appropriate in the article, not to mention your general arrogance and high-handedness, few of us have been willing to remain (even sporadically as I have) to mount a defense of what we know to be true.  I do NOT agree to disagree; what you do seems wrong to me. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 09:53, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
:::::&lt;s&gt;I don't know what errors you are talking about.  The example above was just that, an example.&lt;/s&gt;Ok, I see the errors above.  I will attempt to fix them.  I don't think we will ever come to an agreement about this because you are writing from your first-person experience; that's why I mentioned COI before.  We need to be writing from secondary sources.  The primary source you are using is a film called, ''Rockin' At the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock''.  As I said above, your version of early hippie history has more to do with music of the counterculture and the development of rock concerts.  And, I'm not denying in any way that your version isn't valid; but it gives too much space to material about early psychedelic rock while ignoring (not deliberately, you've said in a previous section that you want to expand it) the intersection of the Civil Rights Movement, the Anti-Vietnam War Movement, and the Free Speech Movement, which like psychedelic rock, also had a large role to play.  Again, this is all extremely interesting, but this article is supposed to be about hippies.  The history article can contain all the origins, antecedents, connections, and details, but there's a lot ''missing'' from this article ''about'' hippies.  I am not attempting to &quot;isolate&quot; hippies from their history, but rather to clarify exactly what hippies were and are without the excess verbiage that describes things best handled by linked subarticles, such as names, events, and places.  I never compared the hippie movement to hip hop, but they are both subcultures that have a lot in common.  Lastly, the demand for sourcing is the foundation of the current version of the encyclopedia.  It's sad to see you fall back on your usual accusations against me, but I will continue to ignore them. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 10:17, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
::::::(By the way, I attempted to incorporate the changes above soon after the original version appeared. An edit conflict prevented me from doing so.)
::::::My point is that you have in the past used sourcing demands to limit the article to selective expression of your favored ideas.  And they are not just &quot;my accusations;&quot; such complaints about your approach have been lodged by many editors since you arrived and established effective ownership.  When editors attempt to introduce ideas you do not favor, you routinely revert and initiate unending demands for sourcing--nothing is ever good enough for you.  Sometimes you have even added themes introduced by other editors months after they gave up in frustration (yes, we noticed), as though they were your own idea...never with an apology or acknowledgement of course. 
::::::There is no conflict of interest here; that is a misuse of the term as I know it.  I did happen to know many of the people involved, however I am not over-emphasizing their roles.  The Civil Rights Movement, the Anti-Vietnam War movement, and the Free Speech Movement were only ancillary to the development of hippie culture, though the spirit of those movements gained experiential expression as hippie culture developed to become racially mixed, anti-war and committed to freedom of expression in general.

::::::Just noticed that you revised your original condensation; the new one looks better and probably would have provoked less outraged response. I would tend to classify the &quot;Rockin' at the Red Dog&quot; video as a combination of primary and secondary sources--the primary being interviews with original participants and the secondary much of the commentary offered by the film maker.  I think Perry's work corroborates much of what is in the film, though he was also a primary participant, so the sourcing picture is mixed there as well.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 11:03, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

Of course the article had flaws, as does the current version, and you have encouraged better sourcing, I agree.  But that does not change the fact that you have been aggressive, heavy-handed, arrogant and obnoxious in your approach, which is why ALL those editors left long ago.

::::::::You are wrong that I couldn't find one instance of your use of sourcing demands to limit or promote ideas, though to prove it with specific, dated references would take more time than I am willing to spend.  Besides I have never seen you concede much, no matter how well-documented, and we seem to be the only editors actively involved here anyway, so what's the point? 

::::::::I will mention just a couple of instances: 
::::::::* You insisted (because one source said so) that hippies never accepted the hippie label and instead called themselves &quot;freaks,&quot; despite all evidence to the contrary.  It took eons to get you to allow the real progression to emerge.
::::::::* You fought tooth and nail against the idea that &quot;hippie culture spread around the world,&quot; rejecting as inadequate all overseas references provided by other editors until those editors left in frustration.  I am not sure what brought you around, but you never acknowledged that their references to overseas hippies were in any way valid.  After they were long gone, you added material supporting their claims.  

::::::::I have never regarded this article as &quot;my territory.&quot;  On the contrary I have been consistent in welcoming anyone who has been willing to add valuable material.  My tendency has always been towards inclusiveness and support for other editors' efforts--with appropriate re-edits where necessary and more patient requests for sourcing than you have demonstrated.  It is you who arrived and savaged the article, with wholesale reversion of whole sections and no respect for anyone; YOU are the reason I changed my name, a symbolic gesture representing an attempt to leave behind the intense hostility I felt towards you.

:::::::::I was ''right''; you could not find ''one instance'' where I used &quot;sourcing demands to limit or promote ideas&quot;.  And, I'll be happy to address your continuing distraction from the topic of the Red Dog material you added, so we can get back to discussing it  instead of me.  Your recollection about past discussions is seriously flawed.  The most I've ever commented on the term &quot;freaks&quot; was to say: ''Hippie as a pejorative. At what point did &quot;hippies&quot; embrace the term? As I understand it the term was derogatory, and actual &quot;hippies&quot; referred to themselves by other names, such as &quot;freaks&quot;.'' That's it. And, it's in the current version of the article.  The original discussion concerned the pejorative use of the word, which is now in the etymology subarticle.  So, I once again have no idea where you get the idea that I ''insisted...that hippies never accepted the hippie label and instead called themselves &quot;freaks,&quot; despite all evidence to the contrary.''  Further, you write ''It took eons to get you to allow the real progression to emerge.''  No such thing occurred.  &quot;Freaks&quot; are mentioned in the main article and the pejorative use is in the etymology subarticle.  Second, you claim that I fought against the idea that hippie culture spread around the world, when in actuality, I added a reference to Hirsch describing hippies as &quot;Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. in the 1960s and affected Europe before fading in the 1970s...fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest.&quot;  Other editors tried to expand this with unsourced material, and I asked for reliable sources.  The references provided by &quot;other editors&quot; were not valid or reliable.  Since these editors were unable to find reliable sources, I helped and found references to jipetecas in La Onda Chicana, something nobody had ever discussed.  Eventually, the lead section was fleshed out to summmarize other aspects of the article which were eventually sourced.  So for the second time, you are welcome. Now, if you would be so kind as to stop distracting away from the subject and get back to discussing it, I would appreciate it.  Of course, I would be more than happy to clear up any further misconceptions you might have about me, but please use this discussion page to discuss improving the article, as I was doing before you changed the subject...again. &amp;mdash;[[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] | [[User talk:Viriditas|Talk]] 13:05, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

I would appreciate it if secondary sources are offered to support its inclusion in an article about hippies.  Related articles, such as [[psychedelic rock]], [[San Francisco Sound]], and others are entirely appropriate, but devoting ~700 words to it in this article seems a bit over the top when other important issues related to the hippie subculture are completely ignored.

:I'm just concerned that some rose-colored glasses may be donned before editing, and the early hippies described as less homophobic than was, sadly, often the case. We got better; but it was an uphill struggle for our LGBT sisters and brothers to find the acceptance that was their due, just as it was for the feminists. Conversely, the Stonewall rising was perhaps inspired in part by what the hippies were doing; but the Stonewall bar was not, as I understand it, a hippie place. --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]]  &amp;#x007C;  [[User talk:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:37, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

::Ok. I read those sections, and while they may have been somewhat accurate, without citations they're just [[WP:OR]], and I think you were right to remove them. Hippies have a reputation that far reaches beyond them. I can suggest two sources for one of the issues. [[Randy Shilts]] wrote ''[[The Mayor of Castro Street]]'' about [[Harvey Milk]], the first openly gay supervisor in San Francisco. Shilts describes how the counterculture movement encouraged so many gays to be drawn to San Francisco in the 1960s to create the most famous gay neighborhood in the world. On the east coast was [[Greenwich Village]] in Manhattan. I covered this a tiny bit in an article I wrote about [[Ann Bannon]], although the time in question was the late 1950s, so it's more about the Beat generation than hippies. The [[Stonewall Inn]] is in Greenwich Village, and any source that describes the [[Stonewall Riots]] in 1969 will be able to describe the neighborhood as a gay enclave. The folks who first fought back in the Stonewall Riots were drag queens, although the riots lasted for 3 days and attracted a lot more people. Soon after the Stonewall Riots, the [[Gay Liberation Front]] was formed, but from what I've read it was chaotic and without any direction - quite perfect for hippies, actually. It didn't last long and was replaced somewhat by the [[Gay Activists Alliance]].

I'm just reading [http://www.counterpunch.com/hatch04122008.html a rant] by Bill Hatch in response to Gerald de Groot's ''Reflections on The Sixties Unplugged'', which argues that the '60s counterculture achieved nothing of lasting importance.

== &quot;Straight&quot; in &quot;Hippie&quot; slang ==

To the best of my own knowledge, &quot;straight&quot; in hippie slang means &quot;not stoned&quot;.  Any hippie can be straight, if the bread gets tight.  I don't believe it is a derogatory term for &quot;others&quot; or &quot;not like us&quot; (except maybe among certain of the self-styled &quot;freaks&quot;, but not most hippies) The closest thing for most hippies would be &quot;square&quot; and there are certainly plenty of vintage instances of hippies using this term in the media, along with &quot;the man&quot;, &quot;the system&quot;, &quot;the establishment&quot; etc. so it was not strictly a &quot;beatnik&quot; term either. [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 20:25, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

:Well, yeah, if you said a person was in the moment &quot;straight,&quot; that meant he or she wasn't stoned.  However in general the term was used to mean &quot;enmeshed in conventional society.&quot;  See for example Lewis Yablonsky's THE HIPPIE TRIP, p. 103 where he says &quot;...They were dressed in &quot;straight&quot; (regular shirts and cotton pants) clothes...&quot; (Emphasis is Yablonsky's.) 

:Also see John Bassett McCleary where he refers to the word &quot;hippy&quot; and says &quot;...it was the media and straight society that popularised the term.&quot;  

:&quot;Square&quot; probably never disappeared during the hippie era, however it was never the primary word that was used to refer to conventional society, at least among hippies.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:35, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

::Hmm, perhaps &quot;straight society&quot; literally meant &quot;not-stoned society&quot; (non pot-smoking society) at first... &quot;straight clothes&quot; sounds like clothes intended to look less like a stoner... over time, the term may have come to have less to do with mind altering substances. [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 20:46, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

:::Perhaps so.  Of course now the word clearly means &quot;not gay,&quot; so for clarity's sake it might be better to replace it with &quot;conventional&quot; in this context. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:49, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

== Second Summer of Love/Acid House ==

I'm very surprised that there isn't the merest mention of the Acid House movement of 1987/89. Surely this in many ways was a revival of much that happened twenty years earlier but in a very unselfconscious way. Suddenly in the UK anyway many of those aged 18-25 were wearing hippy type clothing, becoming part of a movement where certain drugs were freely available and based on a philosophy of freedom/love/peace etc and even in the chillout rooms playing certain old late 60s/early 70s music. There were even a few much older figures on the scene who had actually been around on the &quot;hippy&quot; scene in the late 60s. to me this is an extremely obvious connection - the Summer of 1988 even being called the Second Summer of Love in the UK and the obvious use of the word &quot;Acid&quot;.It was also a mass movement probably bigger with the average 18-25 year old than any youth movement since the late 60s.
Even the use of the word Rave was a revival of a use it had occasionally had (at least in Britain) in the 60s.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.152.33.246|86.152.33.246]] ([[User talk:86.152.33.246|talk]]) 08:51, 18 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== The Right Wing Is Revulsed ==

Being non-traditional, hippies are universally reviled for their impact on society by social conservatives:  questioning Authority, protesting The War, not wearing proper business attire (dark suit, muted neckwear, dark socks on suspenders, wingtips), calling a spade a spade.

== Politics redux ==

*''Hippies were often pacifists and participated in non-violent political demonstrations, such as civil rights marches, the marches on Washington D.C., and anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, including draft card burnings and the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests.[citation needed]''
*''In addition to non-violent political demonstrations, hippie opposition to the Vietnam War included organizing political action groups to oppose the war, refusal to serve in the military and conducting &quot;teach-ins&quot; on college campuses that covered Vietnamese history and the larger political context of the war.[citation needed]''
::This has been unsourced for years with no sources forthcoming. Were all hippies politically active?  Were all teach-ins conducted by &quot;hippies&quot;? It seems like the term &quot;hippie&quot; is being used generically here, as in &quot;counterculture&quot; or &quot;protester&quot;.  Scott MacFarlane in the ''The Hippie Narrative'' (2007) writes: 
::&lt;blockquote&gt;The hippie phenomenon was not metamorphosing into the New Left or radical black politics.  The counterculture had many overlapping movements.  Leftist politicos-such as Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin-tried with limited success to appropriate the energy of the hippie phenomenon into overtly political causes and, while many highly political activists came to consider themselves hippies, many hippies were apolitical or not leftist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::MacFarlane's position appears to be supported by people like Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, etc. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 09:08, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

::: I would say that the above text does not state that all Hippies were politically active; in fact, the use of the words &quot;Hippies were often pacifists and participated...&quot; is a statement that they were not ALWAYS those things. Nor does anything above imply that they were the only people who conducted &quot;Teach-ins&quot;; Stephen Gaskin's Wednesday Night Meetings in the Haight are famous examples of hippie-conducted teach-ins, but teachers and professors across the country and Europe were experimenting with this method of interesting students in dialog and making learning more relevant to them.

::: I agree that there were many overlapping movements, and some of their members would not have called themselves hippies. Political and social-activism hippie organizations include the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies), but I would not put that label to the [[Black Panthers]], though they were certainly counter-cultural. Womens' Liberation and the Gay Activist Alliance had plenty of hippie members, but were not hippie political movements or organizations. One might speak of political positions popular among hippies (social libertarianism, socialized aid to many types of people in need, nuclear disarmament, the end to the war in Viet Nam, marijuana &amp; psychedelic drug legalization, etc), but they were not organized as a group enough to be said to have a &quot;platform&quot;, and many were either apolitical or even anti-political. Pacifism was often more of a social orientation than a political position for them; many (like a lot of &quot;flower children&quot;) had &quot;dropped out&quot; of all that &quot;working within the system&quot; stuff. Others were very politically engaged, and ran their own candidates for office (like Timothy Leary) or supported those they believed sympathetic to their desire to live as they wished and promote a utopian (in their views) society (like Bobby Kennedy).

:::::I agree that this sentence lacks clarity and that it should differentiate between the various events that are listed since they were different in character and focus.
:::::However, in using the phrase &quot;crazy, unsourced contradiction&quot; you seem to be implying that hippies participated in violent protests and riots in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which is a very common misperception promulgated by contemporaneous stories in the national press.  More recent analysis of the events reveals a very different picture--that the violence was perpetrated almost entirely by the Chicago police at the behest of Mayor Daley.  In fact the Walker Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence assigned blame for the mayhem in the streets to the police force, calling the violence a &quot;police riot.&quot;  I suppose hippies did &quot;participate&quot; in the violence and riots, but only in the sense that they became unwitting victims of the Chicago police. The footage in Brett Morgen's documentary &quot;Chicago 10,&quot; which played at last year's Sundance Film Festival, is especially revealing in this regard.

::::::::As an editor, I try to read and edit articles with [[beginner's mind]].  This artificial (at first, it becomes natural over time) perspective enables one to &quot;see&quot; the content from the POV of someone who doesn't know the topic. If you read the material quoted above with that viewpoint, you will see the problem.  In other words, if hippies were pacifists and apolitical (explained in the text) but also engaged in non-violent demonstrations, including draft card burnings and riots at the 1968 protests, then there is a contradiction in terms.  Many sources take great pains to separate the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], the [[Free Speech Movement]], the [[New Left]] and the [[Yippies]] from the hippie movement.  Depending on those sources, it may be acceptable to state that hippies were members of some, many, or all of these groups, but making blanket statements about the political beliefs of hippies in relation to these groups continues to be problematic.  Let's stick to the sources. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 02:25, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

* I'm a little confused on your point myself; perhaps you are responding to something other than the text quoted above. I don't see the word &quot;apolitical&quot; there, and I see no contradiction in saying that hippies were pacifists and they engaged in demonstrations against the war, burned draft cards, etc.

The first paragraph states that hippies were OFTEN (it doesn't say always) pacifists, and lists 5 examples of non-violent political action. I agree with Apostle12 that the Chicago Democratic convention of 1968 can be included, since the violence was perpetrated on them, not committed by them. The second paragraph lists political action groups, refusal to serve in the military, and teach-ins. I still see no contradiction in terms. 

Now, I'm not saying the section shouldn't be reworded. I think it mixes pacifism with civil rights marches, for instance, and seems to be confused as to whether it's about hippies' political positions or specifically about their stand on the Viet Nam war, or even war in general. I believe there was more unanimity among hippies on civil rights than on the war, including protesting the draft; conscription being an issue that transcends this particular military conflict. But I don't see the quoted text as, in your words, &quot;claiming that hippies are engaging in violent protests and riots&quot;. These are NON-violent protests, at one of which they were attacked by violent cops. 

BTW, I agree that hippies were not &quot;not metamorphosing into the New Left or radical black politics&quot;. Their detractors often tried to depict the hippies as communists or communist-sympathizers or anarchists, and certainly some of the most vocal hippie celebrities like Angela Davis and Jerry Rubin professed such political stands and used violently anti-establishment rhetoric. But the Youth International Party and the Black Panthers never spoke for the hippie movement at large; IMO, if it ever appeared that they did, it was because NOBODY spoke for them, so the public had only the loudest and most visual individuals to go on. Most were more social activists than political activists, when they were active at all. &quot;Make Love, Not War&quot; isn't a political platform.

== Legacy section questions ==

#Is the interest in vitamins truly to be credited to hippie legacy? Health food stores and herbal remedies perhaps. Maybe nutritional supplements. Herbal teas, I’d say for sure. But the craze for “vitamin-enriched” products predates the hippie movement.
#In this sentence: “Hippies inspired many other changes — the decline in popularity of the necktie which had been everyday wear during the 1950s and early 1960s; in literature, books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test;[72] in music, the blending of folk rock into newer forms including acid rock and heavy metal; and in television and film, far greater visibility and influence, with some films depicting the hippie ethos and lifestyle, such as Woodstock, Easy Rider, Hair, The Doors, and Crumb.”

What does “books like The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” mean here? How does it relate to the phrase “Hippies inspired many changes”? The book was written DURING the hippie movement, so it’s not part of a legacy. Does the author mean “stream of consciousness” novels, or books with an anti-establishment message? Is this really a statement that part of the legacy of the period is books written during it about it? Also, the film Easy Rider was written and released during the movement. The others could be called part of a legacy. Or is the author saying the existence of hippie works of art still appreciated today is the legacy? If so, what's the change that was inspired?

== Variety of English ==

Til Eulenspiegel argues that this article does not fall under the &quot;strong national ties&quot; provision of [[WP:ENGVAR]]. Maybe not; fair enough. However the main fallback position is then the original variety used in the article. As far as I can tell from the history, that's American English. The very first version of the article, already too long to be a stub, contains the word ''publicized''. Therefore ''flavour'' should be changed to ''flavor''. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 07:46, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

:Even more important, to me anyway, is that the lead section states that Hippie is an American ideal. It also goes on to mention that the word 'hippie' derives from 'hipster' - another American English word. That coupled with the original variation (American English) gives no footing, that I can see, behind changing it to 'flavour.' I look at ENGVAR and I do think this article has strong national ties - just as strong as Tolkein's book, which is used as an example. Maybe I'm missing something, which is quite possible, but what is the argument from the other side of the issue? All this over a 'u'...:] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User:XF Law|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''XF Law'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt; [[User talk:XF Law|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;talk at me&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 08:05, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

::Well, certainly ''if'' there are strong national ties, then they can only be American — I don't think anyone is going to propose a different nation and argue that hippies have stronger ties to it. But what I'm saying is, even if there aren't, we still reach the same conclusion.  The article is mostly in American English, started out in American English, and probably has always been mostly in American English, though I'm certainly not going to wade through the entire history to check the third claim.  --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 08:17, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

== Fashion and astrology ==

New additions are welcome, but I doubt astrology was a legacy of the hippies; There's nothing about hippies in the [[astrology]] article.  This should either be removed or added to a different section with actual sources for the new content, especially the quotes which don't have sources.  I certainly think astrology should be mentioned but including it under the legacy section in addition to a heading about fashion doesn't ring true.

===Disputed text===
''Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits according to sun signs and more detailed charts, was universally integral to hippie culture. Though seeming to contradict their accepted ideals to avoid social classification in community, this interest in astrology could be felt by hippies as an understated part of a peaceful revolution against established religions, as well as against the logical philosophies and sciences of yore. Personal characteristics were of interest in such astrological activity and entertainment, whereas horoscopes and predictions normally were not. Major revivals of the musical mentioned above, in particular, and other period entertainment have contributed to a re-emergence more recently of hippie fashions and of astrological interest and alleged such knowledge among children and grandchildren of the flower children so indoctrinated and trained during the hippie era.[citation needed]''

''A physical emulation of animal images representing sun signs to which some individuals belonged was common among them and influenced fashions. The strong general advancement of long hair was partially attributed by some to the manes of dominant Aries and Leo sun signs.[83]''

== Drug use ==

All hippies did not use drugs. A significant amount were strongly against the use of drugs and alchohol as a health issue. If it is to be claimed here that all hippies used drugs, that needs to be referenced with a reliable source. Please bear in mind that many hippies are concerned with this article as an indirect BLP issue before publishing generalizations that many may offend some people (my uncle and many of his friends among them.)

The basis of the following suggestions for improvement are from the original peer review linked above.

*'''Lead''': ''[[WP:ITALICS]] on foreign phrases, In Mexico, the jipitecas formed La Onda Chicana ... and what the heck are jipitecas? Define terms the first time they're used. (from SG)''
**The term, ''jipitecas'' should appear in the Revolution (1968–1973) section with a brief description.  As for the lead, that would be easy to do with something like, &quot;Hippies in Mexico, known as ''jipitecas'', formed La Onda Chicana... [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 07:17, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
*'''Travel''': ''The &quot;travel&quot; section suffers from the same severe lack of citation as the Legacy section; unclear how much is original research, since so much of it needs to be cited. (from SG)''
**This is a problem. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 07:26, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
*'''Legacy''': Various (to be added)
**[[Daniel Pinchbeck]], ''Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism'', Broadway Books, 2002, ISBN 0-7679-0742-6
***Although I always tend to prefer more academic sources, Pinchbeck's book provides support for including more about Burning Man in the legacy section, as he refers to it as a child of the hippie movement, inheriting the values of the Diggers and the artistic spontaneity of the [[Human Be-In|Be-Ins]], etc.  Obviously, it has gone way beyond that, but more needs to be said about it.

*'''Sourcing''': ''Shannon, Phil (1997-06-18), Yippies, politics and the state, Cultural Dissent, Issue #, Green Left Weekly, http://www.greenleft.org.au/1997/278/16698, retrieved on 10 December 2008''

*'''Images''': [[:Image:Leo Poster.jpg]]
**I'm not sure what to make of this, so I'll defer to the judgment of others.  If we are talking about fashion, it might work, but as it currently appears, it doesn't make much sense.

::I happened to check the talk page after I saw this before I removed it as unrepresentative. My comment on this particular would be to remove it. It was placed, along with a section on Astrology, and used to illustrate that. Now all that remains is the sentence &quot;Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture&quot;, which is a questionable claim as to how integral it was, and the reference for it is &quot;The musical Hair and a multitude of well known contemporary song lyrics such as The Age of Aquarius&quot;. Those are both the same production, and it does not support that astrology was integral. It really seems more an attempt to justify the image, which doesn't, in reality, reflect a hippie very much.

It almost became an art form in itself. Everybody ''did their own thing'' and had his or her ''bag''.The ''typical California'' fashion of suit jackets with jeans also began then and has lasted and lasted. I believe these basic ideals are covered in the two books on fashions in the references for this article. This photo is of a trend-setting Swedish-American disc jockey ([[Lars Jacob]]) doing his best on his birthday to honor the free dress code as well as his sign (Leo, cub scout, get it?).

== Summary work still needed for 1968 ==

It was mentioned here a long time ago that the events of the year 1968, which represent the apex of hippie activism, are something like a mysterious black hole in the history section of this article.  It was also agreed that this should be rectified, but to date it has not.  The relevant subarticle, [[History of the hippie movement]] is somewhat more comprehensive in this regard, so what we need, is someone who can do a good &quot;summary style&quot; from that page, for the year 1968, onto this article.  All we would need for this article is a simple, short recap of the basic points and events that took place that year, if that is not too much.

:A couple points: I mentioned above that the ''jipitecas'' should be moved into that section.  This also implies referring to the [[Tlatelolco massacre]].  Both of these items are sourced to Zolov 1999, and he discusses Mexican hippie culture in detail.  But, that's just one item.  The history article you refer to above has a completely unsourced section on 1968, and we really don't need more unsourced content at this point.  The section above this one is an attempt to get the GA review back on track.  Instead of adding a summary of unsourced original research, it would be much better if editors like yourself simply make a list here on the talk page of details that should appear in this article, and editors like myself (and hopefully others) will attempt to add them with sources.  Or, switch that around; I would be happy to make a list if you (or anyone else) would add them to the article with sources.  I don't care who does what, as long as it gets done.  So why don't we start making a list of what's missing?  If you want to take the lead in organizing this effort, that would be great.

== More emphasis in Britain and famous people ==

Britain was an important hippie scene. I think the UK scene deserves a special section. Probably i don't know but it seems in the US they didn't suffered those attacks as in UK. Somebody or the creator of the article referred to skinhead, teddyboys and mod revivals as the attackers, but i never learnt about it in the US case.

Another special mention is the group of hippies later to be famous. In the US I understand there were [[Cher]] or [[Janis Joplin]] (although she was famous at the time, i think), and in the UK, the counterculture or lifestyle featured many interesting cases: [[John Foxx]] (later a [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[synthpop]] pioneer), [[Derek Forbes]] (later to be bassist of the 1980's band [[Simple Minds]]), [[Gareth Jones]] (later synthpop bands [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Erasure]] producer), many of the members of [[Manchester]] [[post punk]] band [[The Durutti Column]], and probably [[Joe Strummer]] of [[The Clash]] and [[Lemmy]] (later a heavy metal man in [[Motorhead]]). I think they should be mentioned in the article as famous hippies.[[User:Francodamned|Francodamned]] ([[User talk:Francodamned|talk]]) 22:25, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

: I think &quot;famous hippies&quot; would be a terribly hard section to manage. It would be filled with questionably categorized people, especially those who did NOT become famous during the sixties. And how famous is famous, and how much of a hippie qualifies? Iconic figures who DEFINED the hippie movement like Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Ram Das, Wavy Gravy, and such might be able to be singled out, but adding all the &quot;famous&quot; musicians and celebrities would be a nightmare. How would you decide; by their dress? Public statements? Hair length? How would you separate Beat from Hippie when so many were both at one time or another, like Neal Cassidy? The list would be enormous, including members of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother, Velvet Underground, The Beatles, The Byrds, The Animals, and dozens of other bands, and individuals like James Taylor, Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, Joan Baez, Cat Stevens, Simon &amp; Garfunkle, Arlo Guthrie, etc. Add actors like Jane Fonda, Goldie Hawn, and Dennis Hopper, models like Ultra Violet, artists like Andy Warhol, poets like Allen Ginsburg, etc etc. And how would you deal with folks that had a &quot;hippie period&quot;? Some were best known for that time, but would not call themselves hippies now; might even resent it.

: &quot;Later to be famous&quot; is just as bad, IMO. And present hippies vs former hippies complicates it all. [[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 01:53, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

== Will to live ==

The main motive for becoming a hippie in the 1960s was to avoid being drafted and sent to Viet Nam, where there was a high probability of being killed.[[User:Lestrade|Lestrade]] ([[User talk:Lestrade|talk]]) 14:30, 15 October 2009 (UTC)Lestrade

:Well, not exactly.  Being a hippy did not by itself exempt anyone from the draft.  And there was a lot more to it than that.  For many people it was a principled way of branding oneself in order to show resistance to the war.  For others it was simply a great party, and one wanted to dress, and act, appropriately.  Obviously any attempt to simplify &quot;motive&quot; to just one issue is likely to be prone to error.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 14:59, 15 October 2009 (UTC)

It might be useful to bear in mind that in the 60s anyone who called him/herself a &quot;hippie&quot; probably wasn't. Good old Donovan Bess helped to give the word currency among the naive. If you were &quot;in the life&quot; in Frisco or other west coast locations, or involved in London underground culture &quot;hippie&quot; was used in ways that ranged from derogatory to satirical and regarded as a straight media label more than anything else. It was adopted more earnestly by late comers to the party, late 60s and 70s and those that employed it in marketing to young people.
And the draft tried to chase you down wherever you went, which is one reason I left behind the delights of the Haight Ashbury and moved to the UK and later on to Canada. [[User:Altcult101|Altcult101]] ([[User talk:Altcult101|talk]]) 09:50, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:::If you were a young adult in 1967, you would know that becoming a draft&amp;ndash;dodging, war&amp;ndash;protesting, drug&amp;ndash;addled, border&amp;ndash;hopping Hippie was a common way to avoid becoming a dead soldier. Of course, the world being what it is, the lifestyle was imitated throughout the world, thanks to the power of the mass media. It continues to be an influential way of life 43 years later. Every time that the U.S. engages in a war, the original reason for being can be seen in the reappearance of Hippie protests. Young people want to live, copulate, and feel pleasure. The Hippie lifestyle expresses their attachment to life and their horror of early death. [[User:Lestrade|Lestrade]] ([[User talk:Lestrade|talk]]) 16:43, 16 April 2010 (UTC)Lestrade

== The &quot;Wal-Mart hippie&quot; ==

Columnist David Brooks has written eloquently about a concept he calls the &quot;Wal-Mart hippie&quot; [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/opinion/05brooks.html]:
::Today, another social movement has arisen. The people we loosely call the Tea Partiers also want to destroy the establishment. They also want to take on The Man, return power to the people, upend the elites and lead a revolution.
::...
::But the Tea Partiers are closer to the New Left. They don’t seek to form a counter-establishment because they don’t believe in establishments or in authority structures. They believe in the spontaneous uprising of participatory democracy. They believe in mass action and the politics of barricades, not in structure and organization.

I'm at a loss as to where to incorporate this into the current article; I don't think old-style hippies and &quot;Wal-Mart hippies&quot; would get along so well.--[[User:NeantHumain|NeantHumain]] ([[User talk:NeantHumain|talk]]) 01:09, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

::I would say it has no relation to Hippies whatsoever and best added to its own category. I don't know how left you can pretend to be especially with Palin as guest speaker at the Tea Party Conv. After all, the KKK and Neo Nazis were anti-establishment too and I certainly wouldn't call them hippies![[User:Mombas|Mombas]] ([[User talk:Mombas|talk]]) 04:04, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

:::It's clear the &quot;Wal-Mart hippies&quot; are hippies of the right, not of the left. Maybe the concept of the hippie needs to be revised to accommodate both the classic-style hippies of the New Left and the right-wing hippies of the Tea Party. Obviously classic-style concepts like free love, free expression, and drug use aren't shared between the two; so what we're left with is a core of rowdy, anti-establishment protesting as Mr. Brooks describes. Perhaps this article should be split into Hippies of the Left and Hippies of the Right.--[[User:NeantHumain|NeantHumain]] ([[User talk:NeantHumain|talk]]) 19:33, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:Brooks is redefining the word out of any meaning, whether in order to attack the Tea Partiers or the hippies or both is unclear to me. He's deliberately stretching the term out of all meaning to make a point. It's certainly irrelevant to this article until and unless the phrase becomes genuinely notable (highly unlikely by now). --[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]]  &amp;#x007C;  [[User talk:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:10, 26 May 2010 (UTC)
== North Beach ==

I am puzzled about the reversion of North Beach as the central neighbourhood identfied with the Pre-hippie Beat Generation in the opening paragraph. There were a few Beat connected people who lived in the Haight in those early days but apart from NB more of them lived near Fillmore, around the lower Mission Street areas and in other low rent places. Outside North Beach you were more likely to find Beat &quot;community&quot; clusters in Sausalito, Big Sur or down in Venice West.

It was only a matter of the timeline. NB was there in the early 60s (say 63) for the early adopters of the mood.

:::::There’s a bit of a misunderstanding. But in spite of that it is incorrect that the term hippie was first applied to evolved Beats who had moved out to the Haight. The much younger, post-Beat people that created the lifestyle and look were mostly State College (and other college) students and their friends. Once the scene was underway and there was more going on in the district than another slow day at The Blue Unicorn a number of BG associated people came out to play. Some of the younger people who had previously been hanging out in North Beach did move to the Haight, but in the early 60s they were part of the speed and weed scene there and were around Beat hangouts like Mike’s Pool hall, The Hot Dog Palace, The Swiss American Hotel and a squatted closed-up shop, The Church of the Last Exit. And they weren’t Beatniks either. Also it’s curious that hippies were able to live in Greenwich Village in the mid-60s. I know there were a few music clubs they gathered in and also Washington Square, but it was a very high rent place by then – so thought the East Village was more likely?

== Goa &amp; european hippiescene ==

One of the biggest aftershocks of the hippie subculture is the international Goascene, wich is still living in many fastivals all around the globe,

like: http://www.rainbowserpent.net/ in australia http://www.boomfestival.org/boom2010/ in portugal http://www.antaris-project.de/ in germany http://www.transylvania-calling.com/ in rumania and many many more. trance&amp; dance, love and freedom are the values of these festivals. boom is highly ecological as well. 
in germany the smaller spiritual healing festival combines goatrance with the roots in yoga and other spiritual hippie roots.

another point is the european hippiescene, for example there is in Germany the biggest hippiefestival of europe, wich is older then the woodstock festival, its name is burgherzberg-festival. look at http://burgherzberg-festival.de/ its growing year by year.

:I somewhat agree.  Criticism is welcomed, but it is best contained within subsections by topic. I myself have tried adding lots of criticism, but it has either been removed or moved to a subpage, so there is a legitimate need for it in the current article. As someone who has approached this topic from every conceivable angle, I think the most important criticism regarding hippies surrounds their relationship with soldiers from the Vietnam War.  If they were truly all about &quot;peace and love&quot;, they would have heaped this upon the returning soldiers, but according to most commentators, this didn't happen.  The second most important criticism concerns the irresponsible use of drugs, which while a valid form of &quot;yoga&quot; and spiritual introspection for some (see Huxley's thoughts on the matter, etc.) was a dead end for most.  The third most pressing criticism, concerns several different things, including the treatment of minorities, women, and homosexuals within their subgroup.  However, this should all be couched in terms of the hippies as a youth movement, since their mistakes were really those of children rebelling against their parents and lacking direction, a neotenous stage for young adults growing up in the 1960s and early 1970s.

== Early use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; ==

In a 1959 article by Lewis Lapham in a San Francisco newspaper publication, the article title: The Poets Cry Out 'Zen Nuts, Hippies, Squares' was about the Mad Monsters Mammoth Poets' Reading for Auerhahn Press!!! that took place on 29 Aug. 1959 in North Beach, San Francisco, CA.  So the term was already being used in the late 50's.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.32.105.91|75.32.105.91]] ([[User talk:75.32.105.91|talk]]) 19:09, 29 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I've done a little more research on this article that appeared in the San Francisco Examiner.  The subtitle that includes the term 'hippie' is a portion of a quote from a poem read that evening in 1959 by Beat poet Philip Lamantia (one of the six poets on the bill at the Six Gallery in 1955, that is said to have brought about the birth of the Beat Movement) describing the people he hung around with.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.32.105.91|75.32.105.91]] ([[User talk:75.32.105.91|talk]]) 17:05, 2 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
The poem is titled &quot;The Immediate Life&quot;:
&quot;I go around with whoever.  ...mads, squares, demi-poets, zen nuts, super-gigolos, hippies, flips, spade-trumpet players and a lot of others too numerous to mention.

As the article makes clear the word &quot;hippie&quot; appeared sporadically during the late 1950's and early 1960's, however our contemporary use of the term gained traction during the mid-1960s. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:21, 2 June 2011 (UTC)

The article says &quot;Although the word hippie made isolated appearances during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the first clearly contemporary use of the term appeared in print on September 5, 1965, in the article, &quot;A New Haven for Beatniks&quot;, by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon.&quot;

The article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_(etymology) gives citations of various articles from the 1960s that precede the Sep. 5, 1965 article.

I really don't understand why the use of the term in that particular article is considered more important than the use of the term in November 27, 1964 in Time Magazine or its use in the December 6, 1964 New York Times.[[User:Kaltenmeyer|Kaltenmeyer]] ([[User talk:Kaltenmeyer|talk]]) 16:01, 29 June 2011 (UTC) 

:I understand your confusion.  So far the consensus has been that previous references were to individuals who were trying to be &quot;hip,&quot; i.e. &quot;hip wannabees; the word &quot;hippie&quot; was used pejoratively to refer to them as individuals, rather than identifying them with the well-defined group that came to be known as &quot;hippies.&quot;  During the summer of 1965, the people who came to be known collectively as &quot;hippies&quot; established a well-defined group identity.  When the article refers to &quot;the first clearly contemporary use of the term,&quot; this is what is meant. A bit arbitrary, I know.

::That might indeed be said, except that the hippie subculture isn't dead or buried, and if it were, most people would not mourn it.  Labels like transcendentalist, beatnik, hippie, freak, and many others, are transient names for the perennial countercultural movement sometimes called [[Bohemian|Bohemianism]].  Those who find Bohemianism threatening pass laws against it, delete it from the history books where possible, and pretend it is extinct where not.  

::Consequently, as Bohemianism goes in an out of fashion, new movements seem to appear and disappear, each with a new name.  When Bohemianism is fashionable, transients join it in large numbers, creating the illusion of an explosive new trend.  When the fashion changes the transients depart.  This gives the impression that the trend has collapsed, and depresses Bohemians who do not understand their historical roots.  

:: Bohemianism is alive and well around the world. It thrives in enclaves associated with educational and cultural centers, in experimental rural settings, and increasingly online.  It provides a source of perspective on mainstream culture, and sometimes pioneers alternatives that the mainstream later adopts; consider the worldwide ecological movement.  That is how &quot;The hippie subculture still exists across the United States [actually the world] and remains relevant today.&quot;  [[User:Ornithikos|Ornithikos]] ([[User talk:Ornithikos|talk]]) 19:12, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
::: Beautifully written and also quite valid of course. 
::: I take issue with a very few of your opinions: my impression (as an old hippie myself) is that the minimal, nay microscopic, real effect of Bohemianism on society is to be mourned by all humanity. 
::: What has the Internet done for us in comparison with the great elevation of human life quality so many of us thought would be quickly accomplished with it, when we all were enabled to communicate and band together so freely? What happened and how could this be? (That's like a constant nagging ''daymare'' to me.)
::: And what is the real - not pretended and showy - effect on politicians and what they have (not really) done for us on such vital matters as &quot;the worldwide ecological movement&quot;. 
::: How many ''movements'' in history have stood in for real improvement about as effectively as subsitute teacher [[Mae West]] did by sheer happenstance before country schoolhouse lads in ''My Little Chickadee'' (one of the most hilariously implausible scenes in movie history)? 
::: It seems we have created many more games and ways of playing them, but aren't we in more trouble today than ever before? 
::: It's nothing like actually hugging a tree in a major European city park to prevent policitally sponsored workmen from getting to it with a chainsaw (which I did in 1971 - I hugged the same tree again a few weeks ago).

== Way overstating the scope of hippiedom ==

Hippie was always a very loosely used term, and I think the entire article is attempting to make something encompassing and whole out of something that was not. Most young people at the time did not identify themselves as hippies. Having the hair, clothing and musical tastes of the times did not make on a hippie, and neither did protesting the war or using drugs or exploring Eastern philosophies.  People participated in some of these and rejected others; it was never a whole-cloth thing. Few serious students, intellectuals, committed political activists, or other goal-oriented people identified as hippies.

The term seems to have acquired significance decades later that it did not have when it was current. Many who are now associated with the so-called hippie movement considered the label a pejorative one and would never have used it for themselves.[[User:Djxb2001|Djxb2001]] ([[User talk:Djxb2001|talk]]) 03:57, 15 November 2011 (UTC)
:I agree.  When I first started working on this article I made that point, and I cited the literature which said that young people identified as many different things, including &quot;freaks&quot;.  As I've stated before, we need to go from the sources and stick to them as closely as possible.  What's going on here is that we have several editors attempting to mythologize the youth movement, and it appears that you've caught on to that.  Can you point to a single source you've found to be reliable and somewhat accurate? [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 04:07, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

:Yablonsky's THE HIPPIE TRIP is probably the best contemporaneous overview of hippie life circa 1967-68.  While the term &quot;hippie&quot; was used as a pejorative by those primarily identified with the Beats, and &quot;straight&quot; people definitely used it pejoratively, those at the center of the hippie phenomenon (Steve Gaskin, Stewart Brand and others whom Yablonsky refers to as the group's &quot;spiritual leaders&quot;) adopted the term early on; for many it became a positive identifier.  Even today, when Gaskin is asked his religion, his answer is most often &quot;hippie.&quot;  BTW, the term &quot;freaks&quot; was most often combined with drugs that tended to be disparaged in hippie settings, e.g. &quot;speed freaks&quot; or &quot;meth freaks.&quot; Most libraries carry Yablonsky's book, and I would suggest you read it Kjxb2001; it's a pretty pure source, as it has not been edited since its initial publication.

::Re: &quot;The term seems to have acquired significance decades later that it did not have when it was current.&quot;
::That is good as a potential premise, but it will remain only a premise until we find sources, sources, sources that discuss this aspect for a conclusion. 
:If you look at the etymology article, it is clear the word hippie was already &quot;current&quot; in some circles in the 1940s and by the early 1960s was gaining currency in Greenwich Village New York and many other places, well before a certain San Francisco editorialist pompously declared that he invented the word.  But because the pompous San Franciscan's claim got picked up in other publications, we have a sterling example here of an editor here who stands on &quot;Verifiability NOT Truth&quot; and as a consequence we teach in the very first paragraph that the movement was unambiguously born in San Francisco, no mention of Greenwich Village at all.
:My hypothesis is that the word did indeed under go some pejorative change in the 1980s, largely as a result of British usage and influence.  Two factors would be the 1) Peace Convoy, whom everyone else in the UK somewhat derisively called &quot;hippies&quot; even though most HATED the word, and 2) The character of Neil Pye on the BBC's &quot;Young Ones&quot; show did much to popularize the conception of hippies at that time, on both sides of the Atlantic, as the show was then picked up by America's MTV.  This is, of course, only a hypothesis, of what you might possibly find if you were to dig up some actual sources that really discuss any changes over the decades in the popular perceptions of the meaning and usage of the label &quot;HIPPIE&quot;.

We were connected in a way that felt physical. It was a stronger bond than the Internet ever will be able to accomplish. It was heart and soul, not words.

== Historical Amnesia ==

Though well-written, the main article lacks analysis which goes beyond the recording of phenomena to assign responsibility for QUALITATIVE CHANGES which the hippies imposed on the stream of American history.  Chief among these errors of omission is the assertion that, save for isolated groups and nostalgia-prone survivors of the original era, hippies no longer exist.  They do, and they are in the majority within policy-making bodies (official and otherwise) in American government and within society in general.  To steal a march from the hippies themselves by calling upon Pogo, &quot;We have met the enemy and they is us!&quot;  HIPPIE is not, and probably never was, a length of hair, style of dress, idiom of speech or any other artifact of self-expression;  it is, and probably always has been, the sum of motivated actions to undermine and overthrow all that had been standard POV, custom and social practice before the Decade of Dissolution (1960s).  This intent is presently expressed and enforced as Political Correctness and countless other forms of mandatoty self-hatred within the United States.

== Adam Curtis ==

I'm thinking about adding the critique of the hippie movement from ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'' (2011), a BBC TV series by [[Adam Curtis]].  I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts about it.  Going from memory, Curtis's criticism starts with several simple observations: the hippies were influenced by system theories popularized by flawed/incomplete computer models of the environment and society, and their experiments with alternative communities failed because the models they used didn't take into account the human tendency to use politics and power to change society.  According to Curtis, the hippies attempt to weaken politics and power struggles within their subculture ironically led to more of it, with bullying by stronger members of the group leading to less individuality and more oppression contrary to its stated aims. Of course, this type of problem has less to do with hippies and more to do with the nature of humanity.  Nevertheless, this is one of the best criticisms of the hippie movement I've run across, so I would be interested in hearing what others have to say. If you respond, please refer to other sources of criticism if you can. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 07:59, 13 March 2012 (UTC)

:As you put it, &quot;The hippies were influenced by system theories popularized by flawed/incomplete computer models of the environment and society&quot;....Can this really be true?  I spent a lot of time with a lot of hippies, and I can say categorically that even the most cerebral among us never went there.  Mostly we were simply naive; we did not understand that political and governmental structures exist to moderate power struggles that are an unavoidable concomitant of the human condition.

:Probably the most aware hippie &quot;guru&quot; (though he would certainly reject the term) was Stephen Gaskin.  I am not sure bullying and oppression occured at The Farm, an intentional community he founded, though certainly the community went through dysfunctional periods.  The Farm still exists, and its forty-year history has been carefully documented.  It would be revealing to compare Curtis'criticisms with the realities of life at The Farm.

Many took to living on the street, panhandling and drug-dealing. There were problems with malnourishment, disease, and drug addiction. Crime and violence skyrocketed. None of these trends reflected what the hippies had envisioned. By the end of 1967, many of the hippies and musicians who initiated the Summer of Love had moved on. Beatle George Harrison had once visited Haight-Ashbury and found it to be just a haven for dropouts, inspiring him to give up LSD.[citation needed] Misgivings about the hippie culture, particularly with regard to drug abuse and lenient morality, fueled the moral panics of the late 1960s.&quot;

::::::::&quot;Starting in the late 1960s, hippies began to come under attack by working-class skinheads. Hippies were also vilified and sometimes attacked by punks, revivalist mods, greasers, football casuals, Teddy boys, rednecks and members of other youth subcultures of the 1970s and 1980s. The countercultural movement was also under covert assault by J. Edgar Hoover's infamous 'Counter Intelligence Program' (COINTELPRO)...&quot;
::::::::&quot;While many hippies made a long-term commitment to the lifestyle, some people argue that hippies 'sold out' during the 1980s and became part of the materialist, consumer culture.&quot;
::::::::&quot;At the same time, many thoughtful hippies distanced themselves from the very idea that the way a person dresses could be a reliable signal of who he was, especially after outright criminals, like Charles Manson, began to adopt superficial hippie characteristics, and also after plainclothes policemen started to 'dress like hippies' in order to divide and conquer legitimate members of the counter-culture. Frank Zappa admonished his audience that 'we all wear a uniform': the San Francisco clown/hippie Wavy Gravy said in 1987 that he could still see fellow-feeling in the eyes of Market Street businessmen who had dressed conventionally to survive.&quot; 
:::::::Clearly the &quot;Legacy&quot; section could use more counterpoints, since the American right always considered hippies degenerates and to this day most conservatives are critical of the hippie legacy.  The culture wars that divide contemporary American can be viewed as an afterburn of the straight/hippie dichotomy that began during the 1960s.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 08:53, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

:::::::Curtis' analysis could provide an effective counterpoint to this:
::::::::&quot;Nevertheless such activism was carried through anti-authoritarian and non-violent means and so 'The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom...Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe.'&quot;
:::::::Still not convinced Curtis' argument has merit, however it can certainly be noted as relevant criticism. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 08:36, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
::::::::Lot of problems with that text.  Let's start with sourcing and attribution.  First of all, you are quoting a self-published book by someone named &quot;Skip Stone&quot;.  It's not appropriate to cite such a source as if were an historical fact.  If we can even use such a source, you will need to be mindful of [[WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV]]. This is one reason this article cannot progress towards Good or Featured status.  This kind of poor writing and even worse sourcing needs to be  fixed immediately.  Also, we don't generally write encyclopedia articles based on point/counterpoint.  Most reliable sources on the hippie movement criticize the prevalence of sexism, the failure of intentional community building, the disastrous drug experimentation, and the failure of the hippies to even begin to attempt to change the system they rebelled against.  What Curtis (and others) criticize is what they see as the flawed model that the hippies were working with in the first place, a model that Curtis claims is more machine oriented than human.  Just to be clear, most critics aren't blaming the hippies for any of these things, but merely noting that these values were inherited from the previous generation.  In other words, according to this criticism, no matter how hard the hippies tried to rebel, they fell into the same traps as the people they were trying to rebel against.  The problem wasn't authoritarian, violent, and repressive hierarchical power structures, but rather the tendency of all societies, whether straight or hippie, to move towards that direction without proper checks and balances to prevent it.

::::::::::To address the quotes you raised above, it is mentioned that hippies were &quot;criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos&quot;.  I would like to see that discussed in depth in their respective sections.  It's also a bit misleading.  Hippies weren't criticized so much for being &quot;pro-drug&quot; as for being ''on drugs'', all the time.  Some of the best criticism about hippie drug use comes from hippies, most of whom decry irresponsible and repetitive drug use.   Nevertheless, history shows that government drug policies were also to blame, as private individuals were raided on their own property again and again.  The dynamic interplay of individual freedom and social responsibility, love for fellow hippies and hatred for the establishment is where the real interesting criticism can be found.

::::::::::Plenty of differing sorts of criticism to go around, much of it worthwhile.  It's a small point, however I think hippies WERE criticized for being &quot;pro-drug,&quot; especially with respect to LSD, which most hippies took only occasionally.  One of the major losses of the era was the cessation of virtually all controlled scientific experimentation with LSD and other psychoactive substances, experimentation that had become quite promising during the 1950s and early 1960s.  Hippies embarked on an enormous, uncontrolled experiment, where millions of young people took these substances, mostly just to see what might happen.  Scary stuff for the society at large. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:36, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::::The fact of the matter is, American society is very pro-drug, so that's not a very specific criticism.  What you are trying to say is that the hippies were pro-psychedelic. Also, taking a substance just to see what might happen isn't very wise.  Granted, humans are inquisitive, but taking LSD over and over again isn't very helpful, and most hippies will agree with that statement.  I think it was Jerry Garcia who famously said that he would take mushrooms once a year just to &quot;clean the pipes out&quot;, and there is something to be said for that kind of limited recreational use.  Putting aside Garcia's serious drug addiction, one could conceivably use psychedelic drugs safely, but I don't think anyone will agree that the hippies used drugs safely or reasonably. That's not to say it is government's role to regulate personal behavior, and I'm certainly not arguing that side.  What I am saying, is that there are different views on the subject from members of the hippie movement.  [[Richard Alpert]] and others wrote and spoke about moving beyond drugs.  I can't remember who said it, but one hippie figure said that once you have had your eyes opened (to become &quot;hip&quot;) there's no need to keep using the drugs again and again.  The point is to understand the experience and incorporate it into your daily life.  Of course, if you compare this with the alcohol and prescription-fueled culture of the establishment, then one can argue that drug use by hippies was of little consequence. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 22:47, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::::I agree that drug use by the hippies was of little consequence, even by the standards of the 1960s where nicotine, caffeine, alcohol and valium were the drugs of choice among establishment folk.  Today the scale of hippie drug use seems almost quaint, especially in comparison with the casual prescribing of SSRIs to more than 30,000,000 Americans (including children) for reasons ranging from minor depression, to anxiety, to weight control, to pain management, to Gulf War Syndrome, to post traumatic stress disorder, to major depression, to psychosis.....the list becomes quite long.  In fact, most contemporary SSRI ingestion is also &quot;just to see what might happen,&quot; since medical trials are grossly inadequate to predict the ultimate consequences when these drugs are taken by humans of varying ages, with varying genetic inheritances, and with varying physical maladies. I know from the experiences of close family members that monitoring of SSRI patients by medical professionals is amost non-existent.  
::::::::::::Among those I knew, Jerry Garcia and Owsley (Bear) Stanley were among those who made a practice of occasionally tuning up their psyches through the ingestion of psychedelics.  There are probably multiple hippie figures who observed &quot;that once you have had your eyes opened there's no need to keep using the drugs (psychedelics) again and again;&quot; Stephen Gaskin was certainly one of those, though he has acknowledged that psychedelic drugs are capable doing permanent harm to some individuals.  Now that medical trials have begun anew, earlier work that showed a single &quot;trip&quot; could be permanently cathartic is being substantiated.  I look forward to the legal availability of these drugs in psychiatric settings (controlled dosages and purity being the big issues) especially for the perspective such drugs can offer terminal patients.

:Back to Adam Curtis.  Just watched the first hour of the three-part series.  Curtis presents an intriguing, original analysis that I will have to ponder for awhile.  So far I see only a faint, oblique relationship between Curtis' observations and the hippie ethos.  During the remaining two hours does Curtis become more direct and tie things back to the hippie ethos? [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:36, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
::Yes.  [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 21:16, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

:Have now watched all three hours of the Curtis series. This is certainly intriguing work, knitting together as it does so many seemingly disparate threads of the self-deceptions that have prevailed during our era.  I suppose every era creates its own self-deceptions, yet one doesn't often get the opportunity to recognize them in real time, even belatedly.  As Curtis says, though some of us may have become aware of our errors, none of us knows how we might rectify them. 
:As to using Curtis' work, and the work of those he chronicles, to improve the &quot;Hippie&quot; article, I think it is quite legitimate to mention that the nearly universal demise of the hippie communes (&quot;The Farm&quot; being one exception, though I am sure others exist) may have been related to the issues Curtis explores.  I can also see some legitimacy to the point of view that the hippie ethos sprang, at least in part, from the flawed idealism of &quot;Balance of Nature&quot; thinking--and from all the other related idealisms of our era.  I don't think I could adequately summarize the massive amount of data, not the mention the storytelling, that Curtis manages to tease us with during three hours of video and commentary.  I will leave that to braver souls, though I might contribute to editing whatever emerges.
:One final point:  I have not arrived at Curtis' position of...what is it, anyway...pessimism, cynicism, or hopefulness?  Perhaps this is only because of my recent exposure to his disease, which I suspect may contain germs of a self-deception that are at least as dangerous as those he chronicles.[[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 02:36, 18 March 2012 (UTC)

I see no &quot;failure&quot;, and saw no &quot;failure&quot; at the time, in refusing to conform to all the commercial, adult, fanatic, militaristic, divide-and-conquer hypocrisy that we shunned and did our best to isolate ourselves from. That was our conscious choice. It's a bigoted and ignorant failure, big one, to call that a failure. Why quote garbage like that? And how many arrogant rednecks or radical-sheek ''authorities'' are we going to quote, in that case? Never saw the slightest trace of bullying either. The only foolishness that could be called a failure was overdoing the drugs, and that was only an idiocy of ours, where some of us didn't see the strong commercial interests and elitist social pollutants behind that part of it too. ''That'' was sad. [[User:SergeWoodzing|SergeWoodzing]] ([[User talk:SergeWoodzing|talk]]) 23:40, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
:Watch the Curtis film.  He argues that the hippies were essentially tricked into giving up their power (dropping out of society, apolitical ethos).  If the hippies hadn't been stoned 24/7 and instead, ran for political office and changed the system from within, how different would the world be today? Curtis argues that the rebellion the hippies engaged in, was pre-programmed by machine-based thinking.  According to Curtis, this systems approach threatens the Enlightenment ideal of individuals controlling their own lives.  Curtis says, &quot;we have been colonised by the machines we have built. Although we don’t realise it, the way we see everything in the world today is through the eyes of computers. My underlying argument is that we have given up a dynamic political model of the world – the dream of changing things for the better – for a static machine ideology that says we are all components in systems.&quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8526584/Adam-Curtis-the-perils-of-binary-thinking-interview.html] I don't know if Curtis is aware of it or not, but famous hippie philosopher [[Alan Watts]] made a similar criticism, except he spoke of it in terms of &quot;prickles&quot; and &quot;goo&quot;.

:I agree that overt &quot;bullying&quot; was never a dominant theme at any of the communes I visited.  The closest thing I saw to bullying was at Morningstar, located just north of San Francisco, where criminal black thugs from S.F.'s Fillmore District briefly terrorized other commune members, raping the women and violently assaulting anyone who came to their defense. Strong personalities did tend to dominate most discussions, which is nearly a universal human truth.
:I would also challenge any notion that most hippies were &quot;stoned 24/7.&quot;  That was true of street culture in the Haight, however it didn't last long since the harmfulness of massive drug ingestion quickly became apparent.  Also, as the article points out, the use of methamphetamine, cocaine, and opiates was disparaged in hippie settings.  Most hippies I knew were recreational drug users for whom drug use caused little difficulty.
:Most people left the communes because, in the final analysis, these places ''were'' just experiments--they didn't so much fail as they outlived their usefulness for those who participated.  Most of us took the lessons we learned from &quot;living in community&quot; and applied those lessons in larger settings; in particular many of us learned invaluable communication skills based on empathy and the desire to create win-win solutions to difficult problems. &quot;Love is all you need&quot; was not just an illusion.

:::::::::Guys, I think its time to dial back the attitude on both sides. I've worked with Viriditas on articles before in this field, and he is FAR from a &quot;hippie-hater&quot; - quite the contrary. On the other hand, whether the phrase &quot;stoned 24/7&quot; was his or Curtis', it was over the top, and contradicted by the very references Viriditas quoted on hippie drug use; and that was, as well pointed out, taken by studying clinic patients at Haight-Ashbury, an EXTREME group rather than a fair cross-section of the movement. 

:::::::::As far as the communes and intentional communities both urban and rural, I agree with Apostle12 and SergeWoodzing, based on my own experiences studying The Farm, New Buffalo, the Lama Foundation, and other examples, and decades of personal discussions with such original members of the movement as Timothy Leary, Paul Krassner, Ralph Metzner, Stephen &amp; Ina May Gaskin, Nicki Scully, Harvey Wasserman and others, and more contemporary members such as Terence McKenna, R.U. Sirius, Jonathan Ott and Ivan Stang, that Curtis' work seems to be skewed towards a negative judgement of the movement and pays a bit too much attention to a handful of famous negative incidents rather than an analysis of the entire movement worldwide. There is something to say for having &quot;been there&quot;, and I doubt Curtis was. I wouldn't throw terms like &quot;live in your own reality tunnel&quot; or &quot;transference&quot; around too easily about people you haven't met based on a handful of paragraphs, or &quot;nasty Hippie-Haters&quot; and &quot;pompous assism&quot; either. I think you guys are all on the same side, really (though I don't know about Curtis).

:::::::::Personally, I think one of two main reasons there were some &quot;failures&quot; in the movement were 1. the naive belief that all you needed was good intentions and a lot of heart; The Farm's biggest challenges were because the members were young city kids with virtually no experience in ANY of the skills and resources to run a farm or a community, and it's greatest strength was that its leader was not only a wise philosopher and natural leader, but an ex-marine with a can-do personality, 2. both the hippie and psychedelic movements (sorry - there is no bright separating line) had many historical precedents, but never in human history had a consciousness-expanding utopian-society movement been a major pop movement with tens of millions of members and significant representation in mainstream society. This was like a magnifying glass on the movement, making it's good and bad features spectacularly evident, and pumped enormous numbers of people into it that were simply not the sort to be a pioneering member of what would normally be a fringe, experimental-lifestyle community thing. Haight-Ashbury is a perfect example; a significant amount of the problems there came from the sheer numbers of runaway and drop-out young people who poured in with no money, preparation, resources, or dedication and little understanding yet of what it all meant, just that &quot;this is where it was at&quot;, with some vague belief that they weren't going to need anything but being a joyous seeker (and in many cases, they just couldn't stand to endure their home scene a minute more). The drug use with no information of use vs abuse, the predators stalking so many naive, let's face it, children, the lack of any plan to feed, clothe, shelter, treat when needed, and provide employment (and many would have been happy to have a job; they weren't all lazy, but there weren't anything LIKE enough jobs or anything else to go around) came substantially from the same place the problems at Woodstock came: no one had a CLUE about the numbers answering the call.[[User:Rosencomet|Rosencomet]] ([[User talk:Rosencomet|talk]]) 03:47, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

::::::::::Good points all.  Thank you for weighing in.

:::::::::::There is some interesting criticism in the [[Emmett Grogan]] article that can be added here, and more can obviously be found in ''Ringolevio'' and other secondary sources.  To get back into this discussion, looking through my notes I see that many hippie figures have accused the movement of failing, so it appears that observations made by Adam Curtis are supported in the literature.  [[Peter Coyote]] makes a distinction between the political failures of the hippies and its cultural successes: &quot;If you look at all the political agendas of the 1960s, they basically failed. We didn't end capitalism. We didn't end imperialism. We didn't end racism. Yeah, the war ended. But if you look at the cultural agendas, they all worked.&quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/20/MNG2NPUD1C1.DTL&amp;ao=all]  Further, Curtis's criticism of communes is drawn from leading scholars of hippie intentional communities, such as [[Timothy Miller]], so I must object to Rosencomet's dismissal of Curtis as somehow unrepresentative of the field.  For example, when you compare Curtis with Miller's ''The Hippies and American Values'' (2011), his criticism appears to be supported.  Regarding my &quot;disturbing attitude&quot; that Apostle12 perceives, nobody can accurately judge or perceive &quot;attitude&quot; on Wikipedia.  It seems like you are bringing your own perceptions to this discussion.  As always, it is best to avoid painting others with your own perceptual bias and to focus solely on addressing content, not contributors.  With that said,  I think this &quot;disturbing attitude&quot; that you are perceiving has some basis in reality, and I believe it is rooted in my long-running objection to what I perceive as uncritical hippie apologetics from yourself and  SergeWoodzing.

:The statement about hippies being stoned 24/7 is an example of hyperbole, and it is my own.  In the same way that comedy is false but often illustrates true stereotypes, I intended this exaggeration to reflect common criticisms of hippies.  Their withdrawal from the world rather than attempting to live in it, their escapism through irresponsible use of altered states and substances, and their penchant for pleasure rather than the hard work required to change the system—these are all common criticisms of the hippie lifestyle.  This actually relates directly to Curtis's criticism of the communes, as it is often observed that communities that seek to remove themselves from society rather than participate in it have little staying power.  One critic resolved to change this by building intentional communities not in rural areas but in the middle of suburban neighborhoods.  The idea was that the integration of the commune into the community as a whole would provide stability and serve as a reflexive public model.  As for drug use, it is a matter of record that the hippie lifestyle encouraged excess, with many hippies finding inspiration from William Blake's ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]''.  Compare, for example, Blake's &quot;the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom&quot;, with lyrics from a popular Grateful Dead song: &quot;Too much of anything is just enough.&quot; And while it is true that we can attribute this to the nexus of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, there's also a bit of left-hand path tantra at work.  Whatever the case, this kind of behavior has always contributed to the critical discourse and is fairly open and well known.

== Lead-in photo ==

How do we know the woman in the lead-in photo is actually a hippie?  She could be an actor, a poseur or a woman in a period costume.  Is this really a good representative photograph?  

A better representative photo would portray a widely known figurehead or member of this movement.  

I don't know anything about an anonymous woman's would views, politics, etc., but a photo of Dylan, Lenny Bruce, or any of the influential figures of the 60s would hit the point home.

== Origins of the words 'hip' and 'hep' ==

I've identified three sources that cite 'hip' originating from 'hep', which itself originated in the very early 1900s (1903-1908), though how or where is uncertain.

Here are the three sources, in case I am reverted again and they are not showing on the main article:

Randomocity999, your insistence on eliminating this seems like edit-warrring to me.  Sheidlower is a noted authority, and if he says the word gained currency in African American culture, I trust his take.

the reference. [[User:Apostle12|Apostle12]] ([[User talk:Apostle12|talk]]) 20:37, 23 February 2013 (UTC)
::The problem is that the first clause references &quot;ultimate derivation&quot;, while the second clause references &quot;clearly inherited&quot;: this is misleading because it can be seen as implying ultimate derivation from African American culture, which is not what the sources state, at least not anywhere near the level of &quot;clearly&quot;; that's my beef. [[User:Randomocity999|Randomocity999]] ([[User talk:Randomocity999|talk]]) 20:42, 23 February 2013 (UTC)

:::For the word &quot;hip&quot; (or &quot;hep&quot;) to be &quot;clearly inherited&quot; from African American culture (based on reliable sources) is not the same thing as saying that the &quot;ultimate derivation&quot; of this word is unknown.  Somehow African Americans started to use the word, and it crept into the language of the Beats and the Hippies, that's all we're saying.   What we are ''not'' saying is that the word itself is derived from a Wolof word or that we can otherwise trace its origins to ancient African culture.  I presume you know that Jesse Sheidlower edits the ''Oxford English Dictionary.'' &lt;ref&gt;To say &quot;I'm hip to the situation&quot; means &quot;I am aware of the situation.

== Breathtaking POV ==

I can't think of a stronger example of POV than the attribution of the long list of social advances to whatever it is this article refers to but I removed the tag from the Legacy &amp;sect; for the usual reason given in the log. It's also amusing to see the typical etymology job on a word you saw come into existence. I doubt any [[hippie (etymology)|etymology]] is valid, it was just there at the right time when the subculture emerged that would receive it as a label. Geo. Carlins hippie-dippy weatherman was apparently first performed in '67 and I'm sure Steve Allen and Louis Nye used the term before that. [[Special:Contributions/72.228.177.92|72.228.177.92]] ([[User talk:72.228.177.92|talk]])

The POV is there, but it is hard to imagine a worthwhile article on hippies being written by someone who didn't feel some sort of affinity for the subject.  So I guess we are stuck with it.

::M-W notes it as a variant only and otherwise avoids it. Wikipedia should, too. &quot;Hippy&quot; is also an adjective that means having large or prominent hips and it is therefore ambiguous, while &quot;hippie&quot; has only one meaning. In all but the most square and clueless contemporary literature, it was usually &quot;hippie&quot;. The -ie suffix is also in keeping with other epithets such as &quot;commie&quot;, &quot;preppie&quot; and &quot;yuppie&quot; -- and make no mistake, &quot;hippie&quot; was very much an epithet, a word initially applied only by disapproving outsiders. One would have been hard-pressed to find anyone strolling around the 1967 Be-In who would self-describe as &quot;a hippie&quot;; that only came later, after kids who read about &quot;hippies&quot; in the mainstream media appeared on the scene and in some cases willingly adopted the label.

==Far too little on the international developments of the hippie movement==

There is far too little in this article on the developments of the hippie movement in Britain, Germany, Scandinavia,  Australasia and elsewhere after its emergence. The current shape of the article takes the undeniable fact that the hippie movement's genesis is heavily bound with the United States, to overload the article in favour of the early US years of the hippie movement, and away from the later years of the hippie movement. Hence I am putting a {globalise} tag on it.

== Bell bottoms and a peace sign do not a hippie make ==

Could we please have some other lead image than the present superficial fashion-centric one? For all we know, the young lady shown was attending law school, wouldn't touch LSD with a ten-foot pole and had not the slightest intention of abandoning the depicted distinctly unhip residence with its wall-to-wall carpeting and dropping out of mainstream society, even if only just for a summer adventure. Unless they were parent-funded wannabes, not too many &quot;hippies&quot; were buying expensive fancy pants from boutiques. Some of the hippest of the hip wore nothing more radical than a white or solid color t-shirt and peg-leg jeans, or second-hand shirts and slacks from the local thrift shop. The more colorful clothing was typically home-brewed, the product of piecing together found fabrics or ornamenting with embroidery. But the point is that the &quot;hippie&quot; subculture was primarily a matter of practical philosophy, not a fashion trend -- if anything, it was ''anti''-fashion, of the passive &quot;just let it grow&quot; (hair) and creative DIY (clothing and decor) varieties.

:::One didn't ''have'' to touch it to be &quot;genuine&quot;, but however offensive anyone may find it and however un-PC it may still be to mention, the reality is that LSD was the nuclear fuel and the nearly universal sacrament of the &quot;hippie&quot; culture in the Haight-Ashbury and other major centers of the phenomenon. It often had a pivotal impact on users' world-views and philosophies of life, usually one antithetical to materialism and the zero-sum game. An extreme ten-foot-pole aversion, except as the result of a bad experience, was very atypical. There were certainly some acid casualties (skiing and mountain-climbing can be hazardous, too) but contrary to contemporary propaganda nobody stared at the sun and went blind or is still languishing in a padded cell convinced that they are an orange. Most veterans survived with only an occasional psychedelic glint in the eye as a tell-tale mark and some have substantially enriched the arts (many musicians, actors and graphic artists who lived through the period), sciences, and even commerce (most famously, Steve Jobs). At a remove of nearly fifty years now, it would be absurd to be coy or dishonest about this aspect of the subject.

::::I assume you are old enough and speak from experience? I was around then too, right smack in the middle of the hippie movement, and you are over-emphasizing LSD. I hope you don't try to get your drug-happy memories into the article, a very gross exaggeration which is offensive to me. LSD users were a definite minority, and the more hard drugs you used, the less respect you got, the less hip you were considered, by the rest of us. Being regularly out of control has always been considered dum-dum in every human culture. Hippies were humans, not animals. --[[User:SergeWoodzing|SergeWoodzing]] ([[User talk:SergeWoodzing|talk]]) 16:10, 4 November 2014 (UTC)
:::::My &quot;drug-happy memories&quot;, huh? Where do you see those recollected? I am well-aware of the very dark side of the Haight drug scene, which apparently brands all of it as evil in your perceptions, but it amazes me that anyone who was there could deny the major and fundamental influence of psychedelics, both indirectly through the founding Beats and their pioneering experiments in the 1950s and directly through the contemporary products of Sandoz and Owsley that were making the rounds. In writing the posting above, I had in mind the halcyon days of 1966-67, which I was in fact too young (or rather, too sensibly cautious, unlike some of my contemporaries) to experience first-hand. Perhaps you are speaking from experiences in the grim burnout years that immediately followed? Unless you count as &quot;LSD users&quot; only those who were &quot;regularly out of control&quot;, i.e. thrill-seeking party animals rather than occasional serious inner-space explorers, your claim that they were a disrespected minority (along with your DEA-like apparent classification of LSD as a &quot;hard drug&quot;, like heroin and speed) is a new one on me and thoroughly at odds with the published, broadcast and online recollections and commentaries of a number of &quot;name&quot; veterans of the Haight, which have been my primary means of fleshing out my understanding of its peak years. Unsurprisingly, different people, different experiences, different perspectives, different conclusions.

::::::Please create a new article [[Haight hippies]] for your pro-drug viewpoints, and stop generalizing about what this one is for. I promise I won't read it, edit it, supply images for it or comment on it. The genuine hippies I knew and still know have never had a ''holier-than-thou'' attitude about themselves and such ''scientifically/psychologically expansive'' (what garbage!) use of mind-blowing drugs to which you refer as some sort of a model for all of us. I do recall 4-5 people who never came back from those ''scientifically/psychologically expansive'' trips which you seem to admire. They were then permanent basket  cases who got locked up. So much for the freedom of hippiehood, for them. Nothing to admire there. And definitiely nothing hip.

:::::::If you bother to actually read them (I find it increasingly hard to believe that you have done so), you will find that this and several related articles are already choc-a-bloc with mentions of LSD and other psychedelics and coverage of the archetypal Haight-Ashbury scene. None of that is my doing, so kindly direct your wrath elsewhere. All I did prior to your first comment here was allude to the stereotype, but it seems that the mere appearance of that three-letter acronym in a new talk page post was enough to ring your alarm bell and start up your boiler.
:::::::FYI, the word &quot;hippie&quot; was unleashed into the general public by the mainstream US media in 1966-67 as a moderately derogatory label for the shaggy, scrounging, pot-smoking, acid-dropping weirdos thronging San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Ground Zero of the shocking (and therefore profitably media-exploitable) new social phenomenon. (Being aware of that baggage, it always startles me to hear someone self-describe as &quot;a hippie&quot; or apply the label to someone they approve of -- it is like hearing a right-winger call himself or a like-minded friend &quot;a reactionary&quot;.) You said you were &quot;right smack in the middle of the hippie movement&quot;, so I thought that was the time and place you were referring to. As the word &quot;hippie&quot; obviously means something very different to you (no Haight, no LSD), the creation of some new, more specialized article, or a new subsection of this one, would seem to be ''your'' task to accomplish; it is certainly not mine. You could title it [[Genuine hippies]], to accord with your most recent rant, but NPOV and COI considerations might end up getting it moved to something more specific and descriptive, like [[Rabidly anti-drug angry and intolerant Swedish monarchist hippies]] -- assuming, perhaps very unfairly, that the folks you speak of are cut from the same abrasive cloth as the self-anointed guardian of the purity of their reputations.

Pulling this back to the left margin and, hopefully, back to the purpose of this page -- improving the article, not general discussion of the subject -- the redeeming feature to be brought forward from the exchange above is that it highlights a need for the lede to start off with a more clear and concise statement of what the article means by that word &quot;hippie&quot;. What was/is a hippie? A stylish collegian who wore bell-bottoms back when they were fashionable and flashed the peace sign for a snapshot? A hairy denizen of the Haight-Ashbury in 1967 whose idea of bliss was taking a dose of LSD and dancing to the Grateful Dead in Golden Gate Park? A drug-eschewing vegan ascetic who prefers to meditate alone in the mountains and devotes all of his free time to a spiritual quest? A woman in a three-family back-to-the-land rural commune who spends most of the day attending to farm chores? A misfit teen in London who linked up with several others to squat a warehouse and who goes dumpster-diving for meals and other needs? Anyone and everyone who is considered significantly unconventional and &quot;bohemian&quot; by other people who are not? Clearly, the word has come to mean different things -- sometimes ''very'' different -- to different people.

::Do you really not see that a statement like &quot;Please create a new article [[Haight hippies]] for your pro-drug viewpoints&quot; is provocative? It was very uncool and un-Wikipedian of me to rise to the bait and indulge in a sarcastic parting shot in my reply, but I stand by the substance within the ill-chosen form: you come across as not merely anti-drug, but rabidly so and intolerant of any less zealous stance, and anger unbecoming a hippie is palpable in some of your words. I am not pro-drug, I am pro-fact, this being an encyclopedia and not a Sunday school. The fact is that a river of acid ran through hippiedom in its early years, and while your circle and many others may be drug-free, some people still regard various substances as sacraments and occasionally &quot;check in&quot;, albeit much more moderately, responsibly and discreetly than in the reckless past. I do not myself indulge in anything other than cannabis and I do not advocate the use of any drug. Drugs (including alcohol) can make people trip and fall and break their necks. However, neither do I believe in distorting history or suppressing facts because they might lead someone to opt for a risky course of action. Now if you can restrain yourself from replying with yet another zinger about my &quot;drug pushing&quot;, we can draw a double line under this and move on to more pleasant pastures. You have set yourself quite a task below, boiling down the poetry of your own experience into some kind of cited encyclopedic prose, and I most sincerely wish you well with it. The addition of a lucid insider perspective on the latter-day hippie world would be a hugely valuable contribution to the article.

Back to the matter of that lede photo. I poked around in one of the archives a bit and find that others have been making similar complaints about it for years, but nothing ever happens. The uploader's description at Wikimedia Commons is &quot;Young girl dressed in hippie fashions of 1969&quot;, which is far more accurate (although I would modify that adjective to &quot;hippie-inspired&quot;) than the &quot;Hippie woman ...&quot; label someone put on it here. It simply shows some store-bought 1969 clothes and a &quot;hey, look, I'm a hippie!&quot; pose that can be found in countless old snapshots. So I am '''Being Bold''' and retiring it and moving 2005 Rainbow Gathering Dude up to take its place. Although not the vintage Be-In or 1967 Haight Street group shot I would have liked to see (no such photo seems to be available at the Commons), it depicts a specimen I believe everyone here could agree is the genuine article, based on both the habitat in which it was found and the visible plumage. No bell bottoms or tie-dye, but a number of far more traditional hippie dude accoutrements are present: long hair, leather headband, medicine bag, beads, bells, a bit of fringe, portable musical instrument of choice. The gawking tourists from Straightsville ought to be satisfied that they've seen a real live hippie and gotten their money's worth.

:::::::::Poor blackballed Rainbow Gathering guy. To me, he seems usefully generic and of no specific time or place, while interestingly being an Israeli at a gathering in Russia and of relatively recent vintage. The only fault I find in him is that his beard is a bit too disciplined and fastidiously tended for a proper hippie. Flower Power Girl is certainly a historic image, but it veers off into political activism and typical hippies were/are notoriously apolitical. The hard reality is that no single image, especially one of a single individual, can possibly provide an at-a-glance visual summary of the spectrum of hippie flavors and lifestyles this article encompasses in its text. As dispensing with a lede image entirely is not a realistic option, it would be nice to see something that conveys a sense of the joyousness of peak hippie experiences, regardless of whether it shows first-generation pioneers at a seminal 1960s event or young neo-hippie &quot;Touchheads&quot; ecstatically boogieing at a late 1980s Grateful Dead show or a qualifying tribe, if there was one, at this year's Burning Man.
:::::::::Meanwhile, in the hope of seeing ''some'' quantum of improvement and forward progress before I die, I am about to be so bold as to change Bell Bottom Girl's caption per the rationale laid out in my last. She should then be better equipped to inform instead of propagating a misunderstanding of what hippie culture was about, although she still needs to eventually move to the fashion department. Because this far more modest edit rectifies a reportorial inaccuracy, it seems just possible that it may dodge this article's guardian editors' &quot;undo&quot; bullets despite not being endlessly debated here in advance.

::::::::::::Okay, here[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Kaliflower_commun_l.jpg] is a photo of a San Francisco urban commune that provides, among other things, an example of what I meant by &quot;sartorially diverse&quot;, and it is available by Creative Commons license. On the downside, it is in black-and-white, which I know is a problem for some people, and it was taken in 1972, when (in the US, at least) the folks this article calls &quot;hippies&quot; were far more likely to self-describe as &quot;freaks&quot;. It would be a valuable addition to the meager hippie-related material on Wikimedia Commons in any case, so perhaps someone familiar with the appropriate licensing template there, which I am not, would take on the task of uploading it? A number of other interesting images are available from the same source. Just for the sake of balance, here[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Digger-cohort-rural-retreat_0364_Chuck-Gould.jpg] is one showing a rural commune. I wonder how many of those &quot;tie-dye diaper babies&quot; rebelled against their parents by moving to the gritty city, spiking their hair, and doing a stretch of years as hippie-hating &quot;punks&quot;?

Where were the itchy &quot;undo&quot; trigger fingers and demands for prior consensus when ''that'' happened? For evidence that &quot;hippie&quot; does indeed mean a style of clothing to some people, one need look no farther than the top of this talk page, where &quot;WikiProject Fashion&quot; appears as one of the project categories, but that is not what 99 percent of the article's text is about and it is not what the lede image should be conveying. The sad truth is that more than a few people turning to WP to figure out what a hippie was/is will be forming their impressions based more on the most prominent image than on the text, so that IMO even with a revised caption the young lady is continuing to do actual harm where she is and needs to be moved out of that spot SOON.

== Article lacks depth of feeling ==
This article is not all that bad but I find almost nothing in it which moves me. Aren't there any reliable sources for a bit of gripping text?

A real ''hippy'', as I remember what was soulful about us, accepted that label as an acknowledgement of being ''hip to the lip''. I commented on that once before like this:

Being hip to the lip was being aware of the talk, i.e. knowing more instinctively than precisely where it was all coming from and understanding how to put up with it, live with it, love life anyway. We were very aware and involved.

The lip we felt we were quite definitely hip to was all the glaring hypocrisy in politics, warfare, organized religion, commercialism, high fashion, racism, in marketing of everything from groceries to health care and medicine, automobiles, toys, careers, in the monetary system, standard education, the peddling of holidays, the treatment of native peoples, the never-ending Pharisaic control and defilement of the name of the real historic Jesus - whom we felt we knew without needing any details - and of many other great humanitarians, and above all: the lack of real generous, kind, friendly, mutually considerate Love. 

LOVE was the word, or still is, and those of us who write it, always use capital letters.

We were also hip to our own lip in describing our feelings, sometimes just in looks at each other, against all that almost insurmountable hypocrisy; singing, running, dressing, undressing, dancing, howling, laughing, sexing against it all, and gazing at the wondrous truth and reality of the moon and the stars, the mountains, trees, oceans, rivers, and little flowers... Drugs were a possibility for some of us, but not at all wanted as a lifestyle by all.

Some faked all this to try to fit in, a few very well, but we were hip to that lip also. They talked a lot, we didn’t.

We were the hippies, not the lippies. We were proud. These were feelings, very strong among us, often unspoken, usually undefined, that made us all sincerely feel like a global family. We knew we were there, and we knew where we were, even if we were spread around the globe and never saw and touched each others faces, as we would have loved to do. We were connected in a way that felt physical. 

It was a stronger bond than the Internet ever will be able to accomplish. It was heart and soul, not words. 

It was fire, water, earth and wind all wound up together in a bright-white-innocent-silvery-jingling magic of our own. --[[User:SergeWoodzing|SergeWoodzing]] ([[User talk:SergeWoodzing|talk]]) 07:52, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

== No Mention of Mock funeral for 'Hippy' &amp; perpetuating defining 'Hippy' is to perpetuate stereotyping ==

I was with someone who grew aggitated and a little angry when I used the word 'Hippy'.  He asked me, 'what is a hippy?' and pointed out that it is undefineable and to attempt to define it or call people 'hippies' is to stereotype.  He said he was at The Funeral for the word 'Hippy', where &quot;we had a coffin that we put joints in and other stuff that people were calling 'hippy' and marched it down the road.... We were trying to stop the mass media stereotyping around the word 'Hippy'&quot;. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Death_of_hippie.jpg   Thus defining 'Hippy' here is to succomb to the very mass media stereotyping that they were against.
