Hi '''Wynstol'''! Thanks for contributing to Wikipedia. Come join other new editors at [[WP:Teahouse|the Teahouse]]! The Teahouse is a space where new editors can get help from '''other new editors'''.  These editors have also just begun editing Wikipedia; they may have had similar experiences as you. Come share your experiences, ask questions, and '''get advice from your peers'''. I hope to see you there! {{noping|Osarius}} ([[w:en:WP:Teahouse/Hosts|I'm a Teahouse host]])

Hallo, While [[WP:WSS|stub-sorting]] I've come across your [[Americium(IV) fluoride]] etc.  Please remember that every article in Wikipedia needs to have references: you can't just add things which you &quot;know&quot;.  Please also note that it's useful to add &quot;redirects&quot; from alternative names: I've just made one from [[Americium quadrifluoride]] but it would be useful if you added the others too.  There's a lot to learn about editing Wikipedia but it's an interesting journey. Happy Editing.
