[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]], and thank you for your attempt to lighten up Wikipedia. However, this is an encyclopedia and the articles are intended to be serious, so please don't make joke edits{{#if:April 12|, as you did to [[:April 12]]}}. Readers looking for serious articles will not find them amusing. If you'd like to experiment with editing, try the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]], where you can write (almost) whatever you want.   {{#if:|{{{2}}}|}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-joke1 --&gt; [[User:Tlesher|Tlesher]] ([[User talk:Tlesher|talk]]) 03:31, 6 March 2008 (UTC)
