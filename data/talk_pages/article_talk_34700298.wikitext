== MCI ending flights ==
I don't appreciate you undoing my edits about the ending F9 MCI ending flights. They are ending and you need to look up your information before undoing edits. If you have any questions feel free to come to my talk page. [[User:Kairportflier|Kairportflier]] ([[User talk:Kairportflier|talk]]) 23:53, 11 February 2012 (UTC)
