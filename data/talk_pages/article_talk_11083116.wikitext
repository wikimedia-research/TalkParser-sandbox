==Update needed==
The ADAC is subject of a massive multi-faceted kickback/manipulation/abuse of member fees scandal, its tax status is being re-evaluated and 1% of its members quit within only 6 weeks or so. This number is expected to rise further as the club may partially lose tax exemptions (as it is de facto a somewhat coercive car insurance corporation - most people join under duress after autobahn accidents, being given the choice of joining or being left stranded by the ADAC first-response team).
