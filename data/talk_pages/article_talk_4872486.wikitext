this article could really use an update. Moe Mantha, Jr. hasn't been coach of the Windsor Spitfires for a few years now and his 2005 suspension isn't really &quot;recent&quot; Also nothing in here about the actually recent hit on Ben Fanelli from the Kitchener Rangers and Branch's decision to suspend Michael Liambas of the Erie Otters for the rest of the season.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Eeelick|Eeelick]] ([[User talk:Eeelick|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eeelick|contribs]]) 16:03, 5 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
