I have added a &quot;{{[[Template:prod|prod]]}}&quot; template to the article [[Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion(Portable)]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dated prod}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion(Portable)|its talk page]]. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached. [[User:Leebo|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D59AB&quot;&gt;Leebo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User_Talk:Leebo|&lt;font color=&quot;#2A8E82&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;T&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Leebo|&lt;font color=&quot;#2A8E82&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:27, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
