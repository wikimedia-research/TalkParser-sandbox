It's free, requires no personal information, and lets you:
* '''[[Help:Starting a new page|Create new pages]]''', and customize the appearance and behavior of the website
* '''[[Wikipedia:How to rename a page|Rename pages]]'''
* Edit '''[[Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy|semi-protected pages]]'''
* '''[[Special:Upload|Upload images]]'''
* Have your own '''[[Wikipedia:Watchlist|watchlist]]''', which shows when articles you are interested in have changed
* Utililize a vast array of '''[[WP:JS|editing tools]]'''

In addition, your [[IP address]] will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikipedian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:User talk:Epeefleche|action=edit&amp;section=new}} my talk page]&lt;/span&gt;.
