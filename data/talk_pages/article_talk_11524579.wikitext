it really doesn't matter who created it. and I don't think there's much RESPECT to myself to go to every user's page, leave a message, watch the page, and in a year maybe possible move the UBXs (after someone else has already moved them). most people don't care, and if they do raise a stink, they need to read [[Wikipedia:Userbox migration]]. I'm telling you, leave a note on Jimbo Wales' talk page if you disagree with this policy, which I am putting to action. [[User:Scepia|Scepia]] 02:48, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

:{{tl|helpme}} doesn't work for unblock requests, because helpme respondents usually aren't admins (I'm not, for instance).

== Matt Fraction edit. ==

I hesitate to make the correction myself because I'm new to Wikipedia and I'm not sure what the proper format is, but the current edit of the Matt Fraction page reads as though Fraction was born in Kansas City; he was not.  Should another pair of parentheses be added?  What do you suggest? [[User:Deconnick|Kelly Sue]] 04:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

== Message from RVDDP2501 ==

Hey Bloodpack, listen, I was wondering if I could ask your opinion on something regarding the Civil War comics page, would it be appropriate to edit the comics listing and make the list cronological as in the order the comics occur, let me know what you think - [[User:RVDDP2501|RVDDP2501]] 21:59, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

== Question/help from RVDDP2501 ==

Hey Bloodpack, I'm sorry to bother you with this but I though you might be be best person to speak to on this concidering you seem to be more experienced with the working of wikipedia as well as comic books, last night, I created a page for an Image comics character from the Savage Dragon series called [[Horridus (comics)]], I have tried to make the page look to wikipedia's standards but my concern is that I obtained the information as well as the picture of the character form this site - http://webpages.marshall.edu/~wise11/botf/pages/characters/imageverse/heroes/horridus.html - I would appreciate your help on this matter, thank you - [[User:RVDDP2501|RVDDP2501]] 12:53, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the welcoming statement. 
As this is one of the hallmarks of wikipedie right? :)
I did at least find out how you sign your name. 
Using the editing functions of wiki will have to be my next project yes? I have been contributing little snippets here and there since Oct last year. At least long enough not to be blocked from editing the Pluto page (have not as of yet as it is very well done) my favorite topic is the history of science and the history of spaceflight. As a member of AIAA and some other organizations and the occasional personal communications with JPL and NASA project scientists who are gracious enough to return emails.AIAA is very legalistic when it comes to there publications I am not sure how to use them as a reference for a wiki post?
I would have to simply write down a publication and month and year. (AIAA astrodynamics conferences)

==Punisher==
Will do. Hey, it's good hearing from you; I've liked seeing how you keep the Punisher entries in good shape and trim the fat.

You mentioned &quot;Archie screenshot.&quot;  I'm seeing the Archie/Punisher ''cover'', which looks fine to me where it is, but I also notice an animated-series ''screenshot,'' which does indeed look awkward where it is. I'll move the screenshot, as I think you meant to suggest. Let me know if I'm misinterpreting. Anyway, good to hear from you, and I'm guessing it's about 11 a.m. in the Philippines! --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] 03:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

{helpme}
as per the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28films%29#Disambiguating films naming convention] i renamed the [[Blood Pack (Blade II)]] to [[Blood Pack (film)]], but it was reverted back and now i tried to rename it again but i accidentally made it to [[Blood Pack (filmI)]], can anyone fix this? thanks!

:Okay I have fixed it. It did require an admin, but it was not much trouble.--[[User:Commander Keane|Commander Keane]] 06:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::Mmm yeah I have moved the article to [[Blood Pack (Blade II)]], that is the correct title (I thought it was a film, so ''Blood Pack (film)'' would have been correct - but I was mistaken).

==Unspecified source for Image:Medical transcriptionist.jpg==

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Medical transcriptionist.jpg]]'''. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{tl|GFDL-self-no-disclaimers}} tag can be used to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Fair use]], use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use]]. See [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user={{PAGENAMEE}}}} this link]. '''Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

==Age category==
Hello! If you are receiving this message, that means that your user page is in a specific year category. Per a recent user-category per deletion, all specific year categories are to be deleted. If you wish to continue using year categories, you have two options:
* Using an age group category, such as [[:Category:Wikipedians in their 30s]]
* Using a decade category, such as [[:Category:Wikipedians born in the 1970s]].
If you wish, you may do both. Hopefully, this change in categorization will be quick and painless. Happy editing! --An automated message from [[User:MessedRobot|MessedRobot]] 12:48, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

Hiya, Bloodpack. Haven't had a lot of time to stop by Wiki lately, but I'd be glad to swing over to the Punisher article after I've taken care of a few things. While I'm here I'd just like to say how much I've admired you work in keeping that article up to high encyclopedic standards. I wish all editors were as knowledgeable of the guidelines and as conscientious as you. --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] 14:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:You are too kind! I notice that [[Spider-Man 2099]] has its own article, and since Punisher 2099 was in that original 1990s flight of titles and lasted for awhile, it'd certainly be consistent to have it be its own as well. I'm not familiar with the manga Punisher, I'm afraid. Thanks again for the nice words. Good editing back at you! --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] 03:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Hiya, Bloody! That actually wasn't my edit -- I'd simply copy-edited the grammar etc. of what was already there.

==Mack Bolan==
Well I have to say I disagree it belongs under the &quot;trivia&quot; section.  The similarities in character have not proven to be litigious between Pendleton and Marvel, but there's a wealth of sources indicating the inspiration, including [[BBC]], [[Starlog]], and the guy who's drawing the current Punisher War Journal run, [[Mike Deodato]] (not to mention a million blogs).  Just because Conway hasn't admitted it (why should he?) does not mean it's pure coincidence that the Punisher is also a Vietnam vet who lost his family to the mafia and decided to put his combat skills to use with a war on the mafia, writing down details of his fight in his &quot;war journal&quot; and tooling around in his weapon-stocked &quot;war van&quot;.
