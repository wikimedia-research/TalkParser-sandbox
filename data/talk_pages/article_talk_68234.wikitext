== &quot;Rabbit&quot; is really the young ==

SLOWER THAN THE ANTELOPE.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.133.166.237|75.133.166.237]] ([[User talk:75.133.166.237|talk]]) 01:51, 4 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
&quot;Rabbit&quot; is really the young of the animal, the correct name for which is &quot;coney&quot; (pronounced &quot;cunny&quot;).  (The alleged &quot;Coney Island&quot; should really be pronounced &quot;Cunny Island.&quot;)RABBITS ROCK!  This is an interesting example of a [[euphmism]] that the article could stand to address. --[[user:Daniel C. Boyer]]

:In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]' there's a faithful recreation of the scene from the book where [[Sam Gamgee]] cooks &quot;a nice brace o' coneys&quot;, but in the film he pronounces them like the island. The correct pronunciation is probably too close to a well-known obscenity to be used much nowadays. [[User:Lee M|Lee M]] 02:11, 31 Oct 2003 (UTC)

::The use of &quot;coney&quot; would then be similar to the use of &quot;pussy&quot; ... a term which has fallen somewhat out of use given its more lascivious slang connotations.  During the seventies in the U.S. the term &quot;beaver&quot; had similar connotations (much to the amusement of the adolescents in the &quot;Beaver State&quot; of [[Oregon]] I might add).

::Interestingly enough, the welsh word for rabbit is &quot;Cwningen&quot;, a word with obvious similarities to cunny, cuniculus and etc [[User:Communisthamster]]

== Section on &quot;bunny&quot; is poorly written ==

The section on &quot;bunny&quot; is poorly written.  For example the term &quot;bunny&quot; doesn't come ''from'' the usage in '''Bugs Bunny''' though one might say that the popular usage from these cartoons has re-inforced the existing usage.

== Bugs Bunny ==

Bugs Bunny is actually a [[Hare]], Bugs first appeared in 1940 in a film called &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;.Bugs unny is probably a hare but usually they use hare for a play on words in the title of the film or episode.

== A bad thing about them ==

Bunny's',Rabbits',they can be very hard to work with and train.Be careful they can scratch you very hard when holding,scolding and/or threatening.Rabbits' and bunny's' have a thing for their prey,if they fail in trying to catch prey,they can start to get viscous for at least 60 seconds,and they would be spoiled enough to be alone.
Bunny's or Rabbits' are very dirty,some owners...even people consider them dirty Flee-furred rascals, after only 1 day of owning them.

== Giving birth ==

Rabbits are unique in a good way and a bad way ,lets talk about the bad way....When a female rabbit  is pregnant to twins and up,she shakes for 5 seconds then gives birth.the baby's will be attached to each other for 1 day.if she is giving birth to just a regular baby it will come out perfectly unless either she or her baby is a mix.Even sometimes a boy rabbit can give birth if he's the right kind....It will be affly painfll to him.

== Wheres the rabbit? ==

 

To catch a rabbit you need to lay down in the long grass and make carrot notices, but to catch a unique rabbit you keen up on him.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;auto signed&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/203.25.141.7|203.25.141.7]] ([[User talk:203.25.141.7|talk]]) 00:59, 1 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Auto signed by Sine Bot--&gt;

Interested contributors, please see [[Talk:Rabbit (Australia)]]. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]

I don't really know if I'm doing this correctly:
I looked up &quot;rabbits&quot; to address some questions arising from a discussion w/my son this morning and was appalled to see the following clause: &quot;A group of rabbits or hares are often called a fluffle....&quot;  Is this site so unedited that there's no one to jump up and complain about the use of a plural verb (&quot;are&quot;) with a singular noun (&quot;group&quot;)?!?!?!?

== Hunting with a shotgun ==

The article mentions hunting with a shotgun.  That doesn't make sense, too much of the meat is destroyed by the large number of pellets.  I would think that most people would use a rifle.  In Britan and parts of the U.S., it was once popular to have a &quot;boring&quot; in a light-gauge side by side shotgun; the &quot;boring&quot; was a barrel for a rifle round which was fired by a second trigger.  Hunters going through the wood for mixed game would use the two shotgun barrels for birds and the boring for rabbits and squirrels.  I'll await comment before changing the article. 

:Clearly written by a person who has never hunted nor eaten wild rabbit.  Shotguns are preferred precisely because the scatter makes it much easier to hit the varmint.  It's common when eating rabbit (or other small game including birds) which are formed by [[shotgun]] to have a small bowl near the diners into which they may discreetly deposit the pellets as they encounter them.[[User:JimD|JimD]] 00:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

The pellets are deposited in a Shot Glass- which is why it is so called.

Also, will be uploading a photo of a wild rabbit shortly. [[User:Kat|Kat]] 20:53, 3 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Pic removed as it is a [[cottontail rabbit]], not a European Rabbit (the subject of this page).

Does anyone have a pic of a wild European Rabbit suitable for the taxobox? - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 23:18, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I know people that have hunted rabbits with shotguns. They us a small size pellet and not very may pellets hit an individual rabbit so the meat is not badly affected.  Also they weren't really hunting so much for meat as for sport. - Rog  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.165.78.38|71.165.78.38]] ([[User talk:71.165.78.38|talk]]) 22:22, 29 September 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Although it's not *quite* wild, I had a pet rabbit which was a cross-breed (wild/tame), coming off more wild, in looks and personality.  I could submit a picture for opinions if anyone is interested?

== Rabbits in the Wild ==

I'm assuming that rabbits do still exist in the wild, yet this page has no information on them. What types of predators do rabbits encounter? What do they eat? What are some of their habits? Is the posted lifespan of a domestic or wild rabbit?

== Rabbit ==

Although this page associates &quot;Rabbit&quot; with &quot;European Rabbit&quot;, some of the content deals with &quot;rabbit&quot; in the more general sense. For example, [[Bugs Bunny]] is definitely a [[cottontail rabbit]]. --[[User:Big iron|Big_Iron]] 00:12, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Can someone explain why Rabbit was associated with European Rabbit on this page.  While European Rabbits are certainly common around the world, since there is clearly now plenty of information about generic rabbits (more then European really).  To me it seems like the European rabbit should have it's own page, and this page stick to information about Rabbit's in general. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]]

:I agree wholeheartedly; this &quot;European Rabbit&quot; should be a separate article, with the general stuff on the disambiguation page, or maybe a &quot;Rabbit (mammal)&quot; as an expanded page similar to a diambiguation page.

Rabbit news

== rabbit phobia ==

I have read that rabbits are traditionally very unlucky onboard ships, where even the word is not to be mentioned; much like Macbeth with actors. I found reference to this whilst working on recent biography of [[Alexander Selkirk]] ([[Selkirk's Island]]), however I have found very little further support for this idea.

The Unlucky nautical references to rabbits originate In Portland UK http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Portland
See under Trivia.

== incisive clarity ==

It's not very clear to me the description of the difference between rabbit incisors and rodent incisors:

&quot;As a lagomorph, they have 4 sharp incisors (2 on top, 2 on bottom) that grow continuously throughout their life, and two peg teeth on the top behind the inscisors, dissimilar to those of rodents (which have only 2 each, top and bottom). &quot;

Doesn't 2 each, top and bottom mean that rodents have 2 incisors on top and 2 on the bottom, and 2 peg teeth on top and 2 on the bottom in the context of this paragraph?  This gives rodents 4 incisors in all which is the same as the rabbit.  Is the intended meaning 2 incisors on top and 2 peg teeth on bottom?

Also inscisors is spelt incorrectly.

:A check on the web reveals a consensus for lagomorphs having 4 incisors on top, 2 on bottom; this is also what the [[Lagomorpha]] article says. I'm changing this one to be consistent. -- [[User:Hongooi|Hongooi]] 12:28, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

The peg teeth are not incisors, they are small and sit behind the upper two incisors. With the mouth closed the lower incisors butt against the peg teeth, I will try and find out if there is a medical name for the peg teeth. Medical term found, in the vet world the peg teeth are called secondary incisors in order to distinguish them from normal incisors, I have been promised a copyright free pic of them by a vet tech that will be eligable for use here :)
Image of the peg teeth behind the upper incisors - http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~sokaisha/rabbit/teeth/pegteeth.JPG

The issue of the peg teeth is important, these teeth are what distinguish Lagomorphs from Rodents !

== Clarification ==

&quot;Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility. It is possibly as a consequence of this that they have been associated with Easter as the Easter Bunny.&quot;

Huh? -- [[User:jiy|jiy]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:jiy|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:06, August 5, 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't write this line but my guess is that it refers to the [[springtime]] (i.e. revival of fertility) and the Easter Bunny's giftgiving. --[[User:Krishva|Krishva]] 07:01, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, the associations of eggs, and the &quot;[[Easter Bunny]]&quot; with spring-time and fertility are all related.[[User:JimD|JimD]] 00:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== Population Dynamics: Breeding like rabbits ==

I'd like there to be information in this article about how quickly rabbits breed. For example, gestation period, litter size, age they can reproduce, etc. Even some math examples would be nice - like how many rabbits would you have on an island in a month's time if you started with two? thanks

:That would depend on whether you started with young rabbits or adults, as well as the number (or lack) of predators, and I would assume to some extent on the individual rabbits and how frequently they decided to breed, or (in the case of young) how quickly they figured out what-goes-where.  I'd say that, beginning with two adults, you could easily have a couple of dozen inside of a year, assuming more-or-less constant weather and a hospitable climate.

:Lagomorphs (rabbits &amp; hares) certainly don't multiply as quickly as most [[rodent]]s do. --[[User:Corvun|Corvun]] 06:52, August 15, 2005 (UTC)

::It would also depend on the species of rabbit.  [[Cottontail rabbit]]s have different litter-rearing habbits than do [[European rabbit]]s (which raise their young in burrows instead of open nests like the cottontail).  I don't know anything about the Japanese [[Amami rabbit]].  I know a domestic European rabbit's gestation is about 30 days, and a large [[domestic rabbit]] can give birth to up to 10-12 young.  Young can breed each other at an age of 3-4 months even though they aren't physically completely mature.  Other rabbit species may have somewhat different gestations and litter sizes. --[[User:Krishva|Krishva]] 04:28, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

== Expiration ==

Is this sentance supposed to mean what it actually says: 
 &quot;It is commonly believed that a rabbit, if injected with a woman's urine, will expire if the woman were   pregnant.&quot;  ??

Expire means &quot;breath out&quot;.  I expect the bunny would do that anyhow. [[User:Johndarrington|jmd]] 12:21, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:I think you are thinking of &quot;[[wikt:exhale|exhale]].&quot;  &quot;[[wikt:expire|Expire]]&quot; is usually used as a euphemism for &quot;die.&quot; --[[User:Krishva|Krishva]] 05:29, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, yes. But is a euphemism appropriate here?  I've only normally heard it applied to people, and the exhale meaning is what I normally think of when applied to animals, especially if it's in a formal context like this one.  It confused the hell out of me until I thought about it for a while. [[User:Johndarrington|jmd]] 06:37, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Well, if it's vague it should probably be edited to something clearer.  If you would like to edit, go ahead and be bold. :) --[[User:Krishva|Krishva]] 07:11, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

::Technically &quot;expire&quot; and &quot;exhale&quot; mean the same thing.  &quot;Inspire&quot; is the causative/transitive form of the transitive/intransitive &quot;inhale&quot;.  To ''inspire'' means to ''breathe into'', aluding to the [[anima]], or the breath of life.  In this case its meaning is a bit more figurative, in that being inspired means having the divine spark (of creation) breathed into you.  To &quot;expire&quot; does mean to breathe out, but may have taken on the euphemistic meaning of &quot;to breathe out one's last breath&quot; or something to that effect.  And if there's any doubt to any of this, just think of words like &quot;respiration&quot; and &quot;respirator&quot;.  I've always found it a bit humorous when foodstuffs have &quot;expiration&quot; dates; you ''know'' your food's gone bad when it starts breathing! --[[User:Corvun|Corvun]] 07:28, August 31, 2005 (UTC)

Depending on the breed of rabbit the weights vary enormously!
Micro weighed 11 ounces when fully grown - http://www.barbibrownsbunnies.com/micro.htm
Equaly, the [[guinness book of records]] no longer records pet weights due to pet abuse issues :(
Some breeds are in the 20 to 30 lb range, but the averaghe bunny is probably going to be in the 3 to 8 lbs range.

I've read Watership Down and the sequel, and I've seen the movie and one episode of the TV series. I'm a big fan, but at the most, Watership Down only needs a link to its own article in here, not any more.

:I don't think the brief mention of Watership Down or Beatrix Potter's stories distracts from the rest of the article; in fact, I think this concise section enhances the article. Also, Richard Adams' rabbits were most certainly anthropomorphized, as the concept of anthropomorphism extends beyond appearance; the rabbits in Watership Down were given human attributes, such as a system of government, and recorded history.

== Putting domestic rabbits to sleep ==

:'''They can also be put to sleep on their backs by making sure the head is lower than the body.'''
Is this a euphemism? Why would you want to make your rabbit sleep on its back?  Anyone that knows what this sentence is supposed to mean should clarify it: if it's a euphemism for euthanasia, then the euphemism should be replaced with what it actually means. If it's something else, there should be at least some mention of its relevance. I've never seen a rabbit actually sleep in the way a human sleeps...

The trouble with [[Rabbit#Rabbits as pets]] runs deeper than just too much overlap with [[Domestic rabbit]]: The problem is that Domestic rabbit isn't really a main article for &quot;Rabbits as pets&quot;, since Domestic rabbit has more non-pet coverage than pet coverage. I think the scope of Domestic rabbit is probably right, since humans have been domesticating rabbits in a non-pet fashion for a long time (and will probably continue to do so). There is a newly created article, [[House rabbit]] that can help. It covers a large subset of Rabbits as pets, and should probably serve as a main article referenced by Domestic rabbit and possibly Rabbit. --[[User:Ed Brey|Ed Brey]] 02:24, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Nothing about the behaviour of wild rabbits ==

[[User:Romeanna|Romeanna]] 07:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)I looked up rabbits because I’m just reading Watership Down, which made me curious to understand how real rabbits behave, as opposed to the fictional variety. There’s nothing on Wikipedia about the behaviour of wild rabbits – the page is almost entirely devoted to domestic rabbits, as are most of the other sites which I can find on the Internet. Surely wild rabbits are far more common than domestic ones, and yet there’s very little information about them. In the book, the rabbits have a very hierarchical society, the males appear to be fairly aggressive towards each other (or is this just a fictional device?), and the younger male rabbits live on the outskirts of the warren, possibly going off to join a new warren. If this is true, it would make biological sense, as it would reduce inbreeding. But that’s the point – is this really how rabbit society functions, or is it all just an invention of the author? Isn’t there anyone out there who can give us a chapter about the habits and social structure of wild rabbits?

[[User:Arikk|Arikk]] 19:24, 12 July 2007 (UTC) Sorted.  Well, kind of.  I've added a brief section on wild rabbit behaviour, and I'll add to it when I can

:When I read Watership Down, I was also interested in these things. As a result, I got a copy of ''The Private Life of the Rabbit'' by R. M. Lockley, which informed much of the rabbit behaviour in Watership Down. I highly recommend it. Basically, most of the rabbit behaviour in Watership Down is pretty accurate (apart from creating 'shapes', etc!). [[User:Skittle|Skittle]] 20:46, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

== Vocalization ==

Most animal entries have a vocalization section describing the sounds that animal produces.  As a rabbit owner myself I can tell you that rabbits are not entirely mute.  Between reading on rabbit care and my own experience Rabbits produce the following sounds


Growl:  Signifying aggression or in males can be a mating call.  It can be a low continuous sound, or a sudden short bark or grunt.
Generally the low continuous growl shows aggression.  

Squeal:  A high whimpering sound that normally shows fear or discomfort.  My rabbit once used this to tell me she didn't like the
way she was being held.

Purring:  Actually it's not a sound that comes from a rabbit's vocal chords but is produced by chattering the teeth.  Normally this signifies that the rabbit is comfortable and content.

== Conflicting info with Hare page and Cottontail page ==

The Rabbit article says:  &quot;All rabbits (except the cottontail rabbit) live underground in burrows or warrens, while hares live in simple nests above the ground (as does the cottontail rabbit)....&quot;

The Cottontail article says:  &quot;Most (though not all) species live in burrows....&quot;

The Hare article says:  &quot;All rabbits (except the cottontail rabbits) live underground in burrows or warrens, while hares (and cottontail rabbits) live in simple nests above the ground....&quot;

So, where do cottontails live?  Also, are there 13 (per Rabbit) or 16 (per Cottontail) species of cottontail?

I came to these pages because I am trying to identify an all-black loppy-eared rabbit/hare that has recently ventured from a brushy/wooded area into my backyard.  I am getting peeved with too many things out of wack on Wikipedia.  I used to recommend it; not anymore.

== Tone tag ==

The pet rabbit section sounds like it has been heavily edited by children who own rabbits with various knowledge of dubious truth.

'Rabbits are known to run around and yell &quot;BUNNY BUNNY BUNNY&quot;. It's very funny, but very dangerous. Anyone who hears said bunny call will be turned to dust and jizzed on my a monk named Drew.'

== Let's sort out this mess ==

I think everyone agrees that all the rabbit pages need some rationalisation.  Who wants to help me with this?  Otherwise I'll just be bold and do it...

I suggest the following:

1. There needs to be changes to the following pages:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rabbit]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[European rabbit]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[Domestic rabbit]]&lt;br /&gt;
The other related pages, [[Cottontail rabbit]], [[Amami rabbit]] and other species are fine.

2. As has been pointed out, [[Rabbit]] needs a proper introduction.

3. [[Rabbit]] should contain minimal information specific to issues dealt with on the other two pages.  Particularly, the entire section on Rabbits as pets should be reduced to a single paragraph, with a link to [[Domestic rabbit]].  Also, the section on Rabbit behaviour in the wild (which I added...) really belongs in [[European rabbit]].

What that leaves in [[Rabbit]] is mostly zoological and taxonomical information, and cultural and literary references.  That's a bit of a shame, since this article is going on CD.  The alternatives are to bring all the information from European and Domestic onto this page (too long), or to put those pages on the school CD too!

What do people think?  If no one objects, I'll just go ahead and make the changes.

:I think that [[House rabbit]] should be added to the mix. It is a special case of domestic rabbit, albeit a common one.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and therefore personal opinions are completely irrelevant. There is no more '''''scientific''''' debate over evolution then for any other well accepted theory, such as atomic theory, theory of gravity, heliocentric theory, etc etc etc. They are all overwhelming accepted by the scientific community and have all been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt.

== Etymology ==

I fail to see the relevance of the history of the word &quot;coney&quot; in this article. This is an article about the animal, not the trivial aspects of historical names. That's what dictionaries are for. 

Realizing that Wikipedia is not censored, this irrelevancy reduces the accessibility of this article, without any benefit. --[[User talk:Elliskev|Elliskev]] 16:10, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

:hey, sorry I didn't see this until just now. I'm confused as to why you think this isn't relevant. The history of the name in English is just as relevent as any other aspect of the animal - if you look around Wikipedia you can find etymologies in a number of other articles. The article also contains a number of other notes, also completely relevent, that talk about other aspects of rabbits as they pertain to human culture (of which language is a part). Clearly it is not just biological facts but also human cultural ideas about rabbits that are relevent to this article. And, seeing as you see no problem with the note that points out that the name *has* changed in the past, giving the actual *reason* for this change is not only a good idea it's practically demanded. Leaving a potential reader hanging by mentioning that the name changed but giving no reason is something that really would reduce the accessibility of the article. --[[User:Krsont|Krsont]] ([[User talk:Krsont|talk]]) 15:32, 24 September 2008 (UTC)

The history of a word that is no longer in use is far too trivial to include in an article, if it detracts from the article. Maybe this is a cultural difference. The word &quot;cunt&quot; is generally considered ''very'' vulgar in the US. It is jarring to come across it in an article as basic as this.

I have nothing against the inclusion of etymologies, ''if'' they add to the understanding of the subject. How does this add to the understanding of Rabbits? --[[User talk:Elliskev|Elliskev]] 00:16, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

:I agree that archaic slang doesn't add much understanding. The recent edit is better, but could even be shorter.

::It already has '''four''' references for this very fact. RedPenofDoom makes a good point regarding the specific terminology however, so I've rewritten it to be more accurate.

:As for etymologies, as I note above, you clearly had no problem with keeping in the article the fact that the word referring to the animal has changed in English because you didn't remove the mention of it in your original edit. Therefore I fail to see how taking the logical next step and explaining why this happened, with multiple reliable sources to back it up, is a problem. 

:Regarding the &quot;jarring&quot; nature of the word... look, I can sympathise. I understand it's an offensive word.

:Thank you for the name calling, I think we can already see where you're coming from in this discussion. As you are no doubt well aware, Wikipedia is not censored. The only criteria here is whether or not the inclusion of the word aids in the understanding of the reader, in knowing the history of the word for the animal. We have already established that you clearly have no problem with having etymological information in the article, because if you had your edit would have consisted of removing the section &quot;naming&quot; altogether. So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here. If so, we have to look at how we can make this section as clear and informative as possible.

Apologies, Krsont.  My intent was cleverness, which I clearly fell short of.  As to your points, I agree that wikipedia is not censored, but maintain that this article seems at best a very unusual place for that uncensored nature to be a problem.  Also, I did give consideration to simply eliminating the section, but was not so bold as to eliminate a section someone though important enough to put together.  Here is my suggested solution which 1) I believe to truly preserve the interests of all, studious etymologists and inquisitive third-graders alike; and 2) requires your help.  (See, I'm really not a name-caller by nature!)  The solution:  create a new article.  The paragraph, lock, stock and citation-filled barrel can then be relocated, but remain readily available to any with an interest in rabbit etymology.  It can have a link in this article, so those souls who really want to know the trivial-to-most origins of the term bunny rabbit can learn them in all the four-letter blue detail they'd like, but the rest of the world -- including the thousands of elementary students looking up information on this favorite furry animal -- can read the non-trivial content without what many Americans consider to be the most offensive term in the English language being highlighted in blue so it jumps off the page at them.  Win-Win if you're willing to budge just a little (and willing to help set up a new page with a link back, which I haven't yet the skill to do.)  Thanks for your consideration, Krsont.

:However, if I am completely honest, I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the [[WP:NAD]] policy it may well be the case that the naming section does '''not''' really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content.

:I do not know of a separate name for the meat: perhaps rabbit-meat was too common to merit a Norman word, like Boeuf etc. You sometimes see &quot;rabbit pie&quot; (and jugged hare) on trendy English country pub menus. 
:It was &quot;popular&quot; when I was a student, in the special sense that it was the very cheapest meat at Sainsbury's, which accordingly sold shiploads of frozen boned slabs labelled &quot;Chinese Rabbit&quot;.

== artefact ==

I bought an artefact of a rabbit (size: 3&quot; size long) with a man(looks like a prince or Goddess) riding on it. Its made of metal and looks bronze. So far I have been searching for the significance of this artefact and no result. Maybe there is someone who has some or any idea of this artefact? Or perhaps it is just a piece of art with no meaning? Can someone helps me?

Thank you, looking forward to any reply!

== Plagiarism ==

The entire section of &quot;Location and habitat&quot; is taken verbatim from the Encyclopædia Britannica.  It is cited as a source as such, but nothing is in quotes.  The entire paragraph is plagiarism.  This section needs to be re-edited. Maybe someone would like to paraphrase or rewrite the information?  This actually occurs in other sections as well, such as Behavior. I haven't made a thorough survey of the article, but I would not be surprised if there are other long sections also taken verbatim from the Encyclopædia Britannica 2009 Student and Home Edition.

:actually no, you seem to be a little confused. The word cunny is a modern re-spelling of the older word &quot;coney&quot;. It originates from the word for rabbit. If you read further in the section, it explains that the pronunciation of the word meaning rabbit changed, it was originally pronounced to rhyme with &quot;honey&quot;, which is the source of the word &quot;cunny&quot;. I reverted your changes, if you look at the given sources you'll find they agree with the original version. --[[User:Krsont|Krsont]] ([[User talk:Krsont|talk]]) 07:59, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

== Rabbit Behavior ==

Rabbit behavior on the article is wrong. When spooked, a rabbit can be very timid and scared however rabbits can also be very aggressive, hyper, affectionate, and protective of their territory and young. I'm very surprised that this article only has a blurb of the stereotypical behavior of a rabbit. It should definitely be more in depth and informative. Would have added something myself but I do not have an established account on Wiki and apparently the article is semi-protected.  Reproduction is another one that would be easy to explain. There's a lot of information and resources on the internet about these things. Surely someone has the capability to edit in some more factual information.

There are separate pages for both of them.  Remember!  Not all genera of rabbits burrow! [[User:Arikk|Arikk]] ([[User talk:Arikk|talk]]) 12:59, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

== User:RepublicanJacobite ==

You have removed what I have written. I am at a loss to understand your attitude. I do not think my edit was vandalism. The Wikipedia Vandalism page says, &quot;Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. [...] Common types of vandalism are the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, and the insertion of nonsense into articles. Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism.&quot; My edit should not be removed as it is about rabbit behavior in general. Therefore, I have reincluded my contribution and added another one. It should be discussed which parts of these findings may be included in this article or the other articles about European or domestic rabbits.
:I never said it was vandalism - God forbid.  It's clear the effort was in good faith.  However, the general consensus on these talk pages is that the [[Rabbit]]-[[European rabbit]]-[[House rabbit]] pages need to be reorganised and rationalised.  Perhaps you could expand on your entry on behaviour, keeping it general for [[Rabbit]], while taking into account the extensive behaviour sections already written in [[European rabbit]] and [[House rabbit]].

== Drinking behavior ==

Some new findings on the drinking behavior of rabbits may be added to the behavior section: 
To investigate the drinking behavior of rabbits as well as to prove the suitability of different drinker systems under animal suitable conditions 32 rabbits aged four to eight weeks have been held to test in free choice four drinker types usually applied in practice. The rabbits could choose between swimmer-, low pressure-bowl-, nipple- and automatic minidrinkers. In two passages, four animals in each of the four boxes have been held for four weeks and watched by video once a week during 24 hours to register the frequency of the animals’ drinking at the four alternative drinkers. The choice experiments show that the low pressure bowl-drinker has been preferred in frequency, followed by the nipple drinker. The swimmer-bowl-drinker was less frequented, the automatic minidrinker was avoided in tendency. All in all it has been shown that by offering bowl- and/or nipple-drinkers a natural adequate drinking has been presented to the rabbits.

:''Drescher B, Hanisch A. (1995) Testing of various drinking troughs in consideration of the physiological drinking behavior of rabbits (in German). Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr. 1995 Sep;102(9):365-9.''
:Both of these articles are almost 15 years old, so could hardly be considered &quot;new findings&quot;.  However, if you feel that a preference to drinking bowl type is important, it should go in [[Domestic rabbit]], not [[Rabbit]].

== Acquisition of a conditioned reflex in rabbits ==

In studies of learning using rabbits, there has been standardization of behavioral procedures. Less attention has been paid to variation that may arise from genetic differences and differences in rearing conditions. Experiments revealed that acquisition of a conditioned reflex can be affected dramatically by such differences. Specifically, the acquisition of a conditioned reflex in rabbits from 3 different suppliers was compared. All rabbits received behavioral training in which a tone or a light signalled an electrotactile stimulation of the [[trigeminal nerve]] near the rabbits' right eye. This tactile stimulus reliably elicited an eyeblink. Repeated presentations of the auditory and visual signals followed by the tactile stimulus yielded the acquisition of a conditioned response, namely closure of the eyelids during the warning period provided by the signal stimuli. Two of the groups showed steady conditioned response acquisition at a rate that matched previous results by others. However, the third group of rabbits showed very slow acquisition, and some rabbits failed to show any conditioned response acquisition. These interesting findings may also be included in the article.

Therefore it might be a good idea to add some additional facts of this kind to that section. [[User:BertLustcony|BertLustcony]] ([[User talk:BertLustcony|talk]]) 02:11, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
Here is some further information. Observations on domestic rabbits have shown that there are only few differences in their behavior compared with their wild counterparts. See R. Mykytowycz and E.R. Hesterman (1975), “An experimental study of aggression in captive European rabbits”, ''Behaviour'' 52:104-117; D.J. Bell (1984), “The behaviour of rabbits: Implications for their laboratory management”, ''Standards in Laboratory Animal Management'', 2. So the potential for the full range of behavior of wild rabbits is still present genetically, despite some selection for physical, physiological and behavioral traits. This interesting information may be included in the article. [[User:BertLustcony|BertLustcony]] ([[User talk:BertLustcony|talk]]) 12:30, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

:: I was actually about to make a similar change, but saw you already had.

Also, the description of a specific age at which they become mature enough to care for a rabbit seems dubious. Other sources, such as [http://www.petsworld.co.uk/rabbits.htm Petsworld], seem to leave the upper bound of what defines a &quot;younger&quot; child suitably vague. (Note, I have not yet fully assessed the relative quality or reliability of that source - I did have another source, but it was blocked by the spam filter, so I guess that wasn't so good!).

== Inclusion of RabbitOnGrass.JPG image ==

The original photographer of [[:File:RabbitOnGrass.JPG|this image]] has readded it to the page, ignoring my revert.
* First, I'd like to apologise to Darth Stabro for calling your photo rubbish. I realised a moment after doing so that it could be inflammatory. 
However:
* Wikipedia, and this article specifically, already has plenty of photos of bunnies sitting on the grass.
* This photo is low resolution, only 640 × 480 pixels in size.
* The image of the bunny itself in the photo is too small - it's not possible to make out any distinguishing characteristics of the Lagomorpha Leporidae from this image.
* This image has no benefit to the article and does not improve it. This article already features no less than **five** other similar photos of bunnies sitting on the grass. What does this one add?

The PETCO phrasing is clearer; the '''em dash''' is necessary to separate the actions of ''eating'' and ''getting out of trouble''.  '''Trouble''' also is more general than '''struggle''', as it could indicate a situation such as being caught in a trap or snare, where the rabbit could chew it's way free.

So a well-cited [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabbit&amp;curid=26573&amp;diff=387408082&amp;oldid=386661197 edit made in the last couple of days] has added that the lifespan of a bunny is 9-12 years. I am extremely uncomfortable with this statement, because we all know this is a full life under optimal conditions, the bunny kept as a house rabbit with an owner attentive to any medical problems. It's my understanding that a bunny of  9-12 years will be  slow-moving or likely arthritic, so  due to predation this seems an unrealistic lifespan figure for undomesticated rabbits. This is not to mention how well we could cite uterine tumours in female bunnies over 3 years of age.

I thought there was a good reason for ''not'' giving the lifespan here - otherwise I'm surprised at its previous absence. Or perhaps that was a different article my edits got reverted on. --[[User:Strolls|Stroller]] ([[User talk:Strolls|talk]]) 04:32, 30 September 2010 (UTC)

Hi folks.

== Folklore and Mythology ==

There is no mention of Spain (España) and its possible etymology. I remember from one of my linguistics courses many years ago that supposedly the Phoenicians and Carthaginians found the country overrun with rabbits, naming the place accordingly. In fact, some linguists believe España comes from the Punic word tsepan (rabbit). Corroborating this idea is a coin of Galba, which has Spain represented with a rabbit. (Strabo the Greek historian also called Spain &quot;the land of rabbits&quot;.)

The following statement is problematic for the enumerated reasons, below. 
&quot;the House Rabbit Society advise that rabbits do not make good pets for small children because children generally do not know how to stay quiet, calm, and gentle around rabbits.&quot;

1. The cited article at the end of the paragraph makes no such conclusion or contains such wording;  children &quot;do not know how to stay quiet, calm, and gentle around rabbits.&quot;

2. The cited article, in fact, states something quite different, that rabbits for children may or may not be a good choice. 

3. No where does it make the harsh conclusory statement as above. It appears to be the editor's opinion. 

4. The cited article's author in fact writes a compelling account of how her child at 2 years old (at the time the article was written) grew up with a pet rabbit and as an adult (19 years later) is better for the experience. The article also lists many enrichment activities for children who have a rabbit in the home, including infants!

5. I propose the following rewrite of the line based on information contained in the cited reference:

&quot;Rabbits can make excellent pets for children provided proper precautions and adult supervision and commitment are in place when young children are involved. &quot;

a correction is needed.  It is extremely rare for rabbits to get rabies.  Pet rabbits do not get rabies shots, and cases of rabies found in wild rabbits 

For example, per the CDC:

The first entry (apparently from the first edition of the ''M-W'' unabridged, c. 1913) says &quot;a young kitten; a whelp&quot;. Unfortunately, that site doesn't appear to link to that dictionary's entry for &quot;kitten&quot;, so we can't be sure whether it's talking about exclusively about baby cats—but I'll bet it is. (A whelp, of course, is not a rabbit. It's not a cat either, afaik, but it conceivably could be. Oxford Dictionaries Online notes that it can mean &quot;cub&quot;, which can, in turn, refer to the young of any carnivorous mammal. But that's thrice removed from &quot;kitling&quot;, a bit of a stretch.) The other entry (''-Ologies and -Isms'') notes that it's British dialectal, &quot;the young of an animal, especially a kitten or young cat&quot;. My guess is that it's not only dialectal but quite rare, since Oxford Dictionaries Online doesn't have an entry for it. According to my copy of the ''Chambers Dictionary'', the word is used in Scotland, but it's not clear that it's ever used for rabbits, let alone used frequently enough to rate a mention here. Bottom line: with the possible exception of Scotland, the word seems to be obsolete or nearly so.

== Requested Change to Rabbits &quot;As Pets&quot; Section 4Dec2013   ==
{{edit semi-protected |https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit|ans=yes}}
On the page about domesticated rabbits titled &quot;'''As Pets'''&quot;, there are some major issues not noted...
1) Domestic rabbits can NOT be kept outdoors if climates are extreme...keeping a rabbit outdoor is HIGHLY climate-dependent. This should be noted.
2) Leaving any rabbit outside in an open 'pen' requires supervision at ALL times. In addition to being vulnerable to dogs, cats, snakes, and wild canines, they are even more vulnerable to birds of prey. Raptors will absolutely attack them any time of day if vulnerable. They should not ever be left alone when the pen is not fully enclosed.
3) Given many house rabbits can jump well over 4-5 feet in the air, any open pen needs to be taller than what would be used for other animals.
4) The &quot;A pet rabbit's diet&quot; sentence does not make grammatical sense.
5) While rabbits can bond with virtually all animals including dogs that weigh 20x as much, there are certain animals in which bacterial infections easily spread. Rabbits and guinea pigs can easily spread a respiratory infection that can be fatal in under 24 hours (usually the guinea pig is far more at risk than the rabbit, and the rabbit is often the asymptomatic carrier).
6) Guinea pigs and chinchillas are fragile creatures. A rabbit has the potential ability to bite hard and its hind legs can easily deliver a fatal blow to these and other small animals...even during normal play/interaction. A choice to bond these animals is one that should not be done without careful consideration as there are risks.
7) Rabbits can easily bond with large dogs and cats...but the article needs to note that there is a &quot;formal bonding process&quot; that the owner needs to initiate and control to ensure they get along.
8) Many house rabbits are generally not all that timid...depending on the rabbit, they can be the polar opposite of timid, shy, and easily startled. My rabbit runs full-force into the dog and starts honking to signal she is ready to play. If the dog refuses to get up, she starts stomping her feet and growling until the dog finally gives in and wakes up and starts to play. She runs towards people and animals rather than away from...and that isn't uncommon with rabbits whom interact a ton with other animals.
9) Grunting and growling on a house rabbit doesn’t necessarily mean aggression…in some cases, it is an adapted behavior or a modified behavior intended to produce a response. For example, my rabbit growls and grunts to wake the dog up so they can play…and she runs and bumps into people to get their attention to be petted. In the wild, these behaviors have a set meaning related to aggression…but in the house, that isn’t always the case. Their behaviors and sounds are very, very contextual relative to what is happening.
10) a rabbit can deliver a powerful and very painful bite…the part about the bite not breaking the skin is completely untrue. Their teeth are razor sharp and their jaws are quite powerful given what they eat requires serious saw/grinding power. While they often will only ‘nip’ as a warning which generally does not cause much trauma, a full force bite on a finger is enough to go through tendon/muscle and down to bone. But I do agree bites usually have warning signs before they occur and are easy to stop with behavior modification. Nonetheless, an ignorant owner can easily get them to a point of biting and they have the ability to deliver a serious bite and it is a major reason they are poorly suited to young (and especially irresponsible) children.

Article could use a better European rabbit photo. The existing one with a ... spherical red thing ... doesn't illustrate size well, and looks like it's been poorly Photoshopped.

== Rabbits on their back to paralyze them ==
There is a rumor that may or may not be true.
If you put a rabbit on its back it is paralyzed can will not move.
I feel like this should be either a section in the article or a section in the urban legends portion of this article.
Sadly i dont know enough to write that portion though.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/188.195.171.202|188.195.171.202]] ([[User talk:188.195.171.202|talk]]) 21:08, 22 April 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Rabbits in Pre-Columbian America ==

I always found it intriguing the fact that there are ancient paintings and myths about rabbits in ancient America, specially in the Mayan Myths (The Moon Rabbit), as seen here: [[Maya_moon_goddess|Maya Moon Goddess]] . There's even a rabbit painted in one of the murals. Then, probably the information about their arrival with the Columbian Exchange is inaccurate. It's also mentioned in the folklore section of this article as part of an Aztec myth. But I can't find a good source of information aside from this one. If anyone has this information, please add it and edit the wiki accordingly ~~TaikunJ~~

You do know that there are rabbits species native to north America right? Ever heard of a Cottontail rabbit much less the native hares?

== Suggested change for the &quot;as pets&quot; section ==

As the last paragraph in this section mentions that rabbits can be kept as companions with guinea pigs, I would like to suggest this change:

Rabbits are social animals and should be kept with at least one of their own kind, they live in large groups in the wild. To keep a pair or group they must all be spayed and neutered and bonded together carefully. It was once believed that rabbits could find companionship with guinea pigs, however, it is now known that rabbits and guinea pigs have very different social and nutritional needs and should be kept separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/rabbits/company/rabbitsandguineapigs RSPCA] advice on keeping rabbits and guinea pigs&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits can learn to accept dogs, cats and other animals, however, great care is to be taken around predators such as cats and dogs, who may see the rabbit as prey.

&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
please delete &quot;* In [[Jewish folklore]], rabbits (shfanim שפנים) are associated with cowardice, a usage still current in contemporary [[Israel]]i spoken [[Hebrew]] (similar to English colloquial use of &quot;chicken&quot; to denote cowardice).&quot; 

rationale:
Shfanim are not rabbits but hyraxes, as is attested by the hebrew wikipedia page http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D (so the information should perhaps be moved to the hyrax entry)

It is true that in many contemporary Hebrew sources the two are often confused, but I don't know where to get a reliable source to back this up.

== Images needing articles ==

== Morphology section needs reworking ==

My original edit summary (till I realized it wasn't describing my edits but what needed to be done) was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(→‎Morphology: This section needs to be re-researched and -written to detail the common morphology of all or most rabbits, then the differences between wild and domesticated breeds, possibly with a sub-section on unusual traits. )
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I realized that when requesting clarification of:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wild rabbits do not differ[clarification needed (Compared to each other or compared to domesticated breeds?)] much in their body proportions or stance, with full, egg-shaped bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

There also needs to be a discussion of the lack of pads in the paw of the rabbit compared to other domesticated quadrupeds. &lt;small&gt;(I can't believe I spelled that right on the first try!)&lt;/small&gt; I'm going to start that with a citation needed tag, as researching it is [[User:Geekdiva|beyond me this month at minimum]], but I know that it's an issue because when rabbits are kept in cages with wire flooring, they have no pads to protect them from it. This lack (but not the consequence, &lt;small&gt;which I know of from taking care of one of my rescued rabbits who was active till she died 13 years old, which shows that I did a good job!)(her 2 younger buddies are still alive&lt;/small&gt;) is also mentioned in [[Paw]]. 

Sorry all I can do is ramble to point this out! &lt;small&gt;(...which is why I go back &amp; use small tags plus keep this quote on my page: &quot;I have made this letter longer than usual, because I lack the time to make it short.&quot; —Blaise Pascal.)&lt;/small&gt; Thanks in advance. --[[User:Geekdiva|Geekdiva]] ([[User talk:Geekdiva|talk]]) 10:37, 21 March 2015 (UTC)

== Rabbit starvation? ==

Need we go into such detail about [[rabbit starvation]] here? It's not the rabbits' fault, and this issue is adequately covered in its own article. Certainly this doesn't provide helpful information regarding rabbit meat: &quot;In comparison, pemmican is a meat-based food that is nutritionally complete but is composed of dry meat fibers and fat in a 1:1 ratio by weight.&quot;
