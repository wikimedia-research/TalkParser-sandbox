This article is in desperate need of cleaning up.  I've just finished reading about Braid (Post by Eric Grubbs) and will attempt to clean up the article.  However, I would appreciate any help that anyone can offer. It will probably take me several edits, so please keep that in mind before deciding to put it up for deletion.[[User:Natt the Hatt|Natt the Hatt]] ([[User talk:Natt the Hatt|talk]]) 19:01, 14 August 2010 (UTC)

Okay, I've finished the clean up of this article.  I still need to get my sources in, but that may take some time.  Please add any you may come across to make this article better. [[User:Natt the Hatt|Natt the Hatt]] ([[User talk:Natt the Hatt|talk]]) 20:10, 2 October 2010 (UTC)
