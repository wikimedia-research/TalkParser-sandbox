[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]], and thank you for your attempt to lighten up Wikipedia. However, this is an encyclopedia and the articles are intended to be serious, so please don't make joke edits{{#if:Derby County F.C|, as you did to [[:Derby County F.C]]}}. Readers looking for serious articles will not find them amusing. If you'd like to experiment with editing, try the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]], where you can write (almost) whatever you want.   {{#if:|{{{2}}}|}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-joke1 --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt; '''[[User:TheProf07|TheProf]]''' &lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt; '''[[User_talk:TheProf07|Talk]]''' &lt;/span&gt; 16:17, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
