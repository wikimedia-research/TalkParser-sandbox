Manual review:
* Images: 
** [[:Image:Knossos bull.jpg]]and [[:Image:Knossos frise pieuvre edit.jpg]] tag is possibly wrong, is the photo's life of the author plus 70 years?
** There are 2 labrys of gold, one is redundant. [[:Image:Labrys.jpg]] tag is possibly wrong, is the photo's life of the author plus 70 years? The source link is dead, no source verification
** The galleries can be avoided. 
* References:
** In certain places parenthesis is used for ref, elsewhere &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Use one throughout.
** Though there is a list of references, there are very just inline references considering the size of the text. Add them, inline references are necessary for GA status. Fails &quot;at minimum, it provides in-line citations from reliable sources for statistics, published opinion,&quot; like years, quoting Homer etc.
** Page numbers are missing for some ref
** {{fact}} tags added upto &quot;Religion&quot;, {{fact}} tags are not added for years, though they need refs too.
* Broad in its coverage, Stable: Yes.
* The lead does not cover all areas of the article, there is [[WP:UNDUE]] to what Minoans were called and palaces.
* Every other word should be linked, e.g. mountain, island need not be linked. Only those related to the topic or jargon, must be linked.--[[User:Redtigerxyz|Redtigerxyz]] ([[User talk:Redtigerxyz|talk]]) 12:39, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

'''GA FAIL'''--[[User:Redtigerxyz|Redtigerxyz]] ([[User talk:Redtigerxyz|talk]]) 12:43, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

Automated peer review:
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{name}}}|Minoan civilization|[[User:Redtigerxyz|Redtigerxyz]] ([[User talk:Redtigerxyz|talk]]) 12:46, 11 October 2008 (UTC)}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;The following suggestions were generated by a semi-automatic [[User:AndyZ/peerreviewer|javascript program]], and might not be applicable for the article in question.
*If there is not a [[WP:IT|free use]] image in the top right corner of the article, please try to find and include one.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#leadimg|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Avoid including [[WP:IG|galleries]] in articles, as per [[Wikipedia:Galleries#Policy|Wikipedia:Galleries]]. Common solutions to this problem include moving the gallery to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page wikicommons] or integrating images with the text.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#ig|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*You may wish to consider adding an appropriate [[WP:INFOBOX|infobox]] for this article, if one exists relating to the topic of the article. &lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#infobox|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt; (Note that there might not be an applicable infobox; remember that these suggestions are not generated manually)
*Per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Units of measurement|Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers)]], there should be a non-breaking space - &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of ''100 metres'', use ''100&amp;nbsp;metres'', which when you are editing the page, should look like: &lt;tt&gt;100&amp;amp;nbsp;metres&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#nbsp|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Per [[WP:WIAFA]], this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per [[Wikipedia:Summary style]].&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#toc|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*This article may need to undergo [[WP:SS|summary style]], where a series of appropriate subpages are used. For example, if the article is [[United States]], then an appropriate subpage would be [[History of the United States]], such that a summary of the subpage exists on the mother article, while the subpage goes into more detail.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#SS|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Please make the spelling of English words consistent with either [[American and British English spelling differences|American or British spelling]], depending upon the subject of the article. Examples include: ''honour'' (B) (American: ''honor''), ''harbor'' (A) (British: ''harbour''), ''meter'' (A) (British: ''metre''), ''metre'' (B) (American: ''meter''), ''recognize'' (A) (British: ''recognise''), ''criticise'' (B) (American: ''criticize''), ''isation'' (B) (American: ''ization''), ''skillful'' (A) (British: ''skilful''), ''jewelry'' (A) (British: ''jewellery'').
*Watch for [[User:Tony1/How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a#Redundancy|redundancies]] that make the article too wordy instead of being crisp and concise. (You may wish to try Tony1's [[User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a: redundancy exercises|redundancy exercises]].)
**Vague terms of size often are unnecessary and redundant -  “some”, “a variety/number/majority of”, “several”, “a few”, “many”, “any”, and “all”. For example, “&lt;font color='red'&gt;&lt;s&gt;All&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/font&gt; pigs are pink, so we thought of &lt;font color='red'&gt;&lt;s&gt;a number of&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ways to turn them green.”
*As done in [[WP:FOOTNOTE]], footnotes usually are located right after a punctuation mark (as recommended by the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|CMS]], but not mandatory), such that there is no space in between. For example, ''the sun is larger than the moon [2].'' is usually written as ''the sun is larger than the moon.[2]''&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#footspace|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Please provide citations for all of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#fact|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*Please ensure that the article has gone through a thorough copyediting so that it exemplifies some of [[WP:WIAFA|Wikipedia's best work]]. See also [[User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a]].&lt;sup&gt;[[User:AndyZ/G#copyedit|[?]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
