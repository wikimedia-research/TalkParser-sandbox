==Untitled==
I just thought I should say that I created this article and wasn't aware of the [[WP:MUSIC]] guidelines. I am (one of many) fans of the band and, to my knowledge, they don't know about this article's existence. I am sorry about this and now realize that I should not have started this article, but it is not the band's fault and there is no self promotion on their part.

Sorry again. I am a great fan of Wikipedia and would not intentionally do anything to undermine its policies.
