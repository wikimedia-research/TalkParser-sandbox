[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Welcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, please note that there is a [[Wikipedia:MOS|Manual of Style]] that should be followed to maintain a consistent, encyclopedic appearance. Deviating from this style, as you did in [[:Ek Hazaaron Mein Meri Behna Hai]], disturbs uniformity among articles and may cause readability or accessibility problems. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-mos1 --&gt; [[User:Jeffrd10|Jeffrd10]] ([[User talk:Jeffrd10|talk]]) 14:49, 11 September 2013 (UTC)
