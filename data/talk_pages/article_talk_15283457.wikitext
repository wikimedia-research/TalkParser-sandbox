== Copyright problem ==
This article has been revised as part of the large-scale clean-up project of a massive copyright infringement on Wikipedia. Earlier text must not be restored, ''unless'' it can be verified to be free of infringement. For legal reasons, Wikipedia cannot accept [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyrighted]] text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material; such additions must be deleted. Contributors may use sources as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences'' or ''phrases''. Accordingly, the material ''may'' be [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2009-04-13/Dispatches|rewritten]], but only if it does not infringe on the copyright of the original ''or'' [[plagiarize]] from that source. Please see our [[Wikipedia:NFC#Text|guideline on non-free text]] for how to properly implement limited quotations of copyrighted text. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously.

For more information on this situation, which involved a single contributor liberally copying material from print and internet sources into several thousand articles, please see the two administrators' noticeboard discussions of the matter,  [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive521#A_very_large_and_widespread_CopyVio_problem|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Archive187#Huge_copyright_mess.2C_redux|here]], as well as the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Subpage for organizing CopyVio Cleanup|the cleanup task force subpage]].
