== Organising CAD Comparisons ==
I (--[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 23:20, 10 December 2008 (UTC)) got this direct message which I'll put here to start a discussion:
You changed the article Comparison of CAD software, redirecting it to Comparison of CAD editors for AEC and creating Comparison of CAD editors for CAM. I see threemajor problemes to this move:

first, under the Comparison of CAD editors for AEC article are listed mainly software which are not AEC.
second, the Comparison of CAD editors for CAM article is actually a list of ECAD sofwtares.
last, the Comparison of CAD software is now empty.

Could you please explain your motives and the scope at which the evolution will be complete. I would agree that the different types of CAD software would have to be segragated by type, each major type having a specific article, but a central CAD article must survive, and software must not be listen under incorrect titles. --Dwarfpower (talk) 12:54, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

:I don't know what else to do. When I first started the comparison I was because there is a real need for a vendor neutral comparison of CAD products for AEC. Rather foolishly I didn't realise there would be so much extra stuff added to a less specific comparison. My attempt to improve this is just to be more specific and create some alternatives for other types of CAD software. I don't agree that there should be a central CAD comparison, that would just duplicate and add effort. But that was just my original thinking, and it's not my article, just something I started. I'm glad to see it's found some interest. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 23:20, 10 December 2008 (UTC)

How close are we to being ready for a [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment]]? Now I'd say 70%. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 12:41, 9 July 2008 (UTC)
How close are we to being ready for a [[Wikipedia:Peer_review]]?

===Langugage codes===
I propose that for space-saving measures, there should be two-letter [[ISO-639-1]] [[language code]]s instead of three-letter language codes in general, with three-letter language codes where there is no two-letter alternative or for disambiguation.

Such that a large number of languages would not extend the table further downwards, even if it's just marginal:

= Rollback explanation =
reminder: Are elligible to be present in this list '''software application for creating technical drawings'''. 

Artisitc modelling software are not to be listed here. FEM software and packages are n,ot to be listed here either, and neither do EDA. This is simply not the place. CAD as used in this list has the very restricted meaning remindeed

Most entry added after  ''''''12:10, 25 September 2008''''' not elligible to this page, ( not CAD tools in the sense of this page ) or are il lformated ( broekn links, links to pages that are not the software intended. reformat, verify links and elligibility. --[[User:Dwarfpower|Dwarfpower]] ([[User talk:Dwarfpower|talk]]) 12:37, 27 September 2008 (UTC)

* Lot of application (Viewlogic, TinyCAD, OrCAD, Mentor Graphics, KiCad, Eagle) present in the list before my add are EDA software and not mechanical CAD software. Probably I should conclude that the page was not well manteined, or you are against opensource software. But I'm started to prepare a complete list of mechanical CAD programs, electronic CAD programs, and artistic CAD programs, with the aim to create 3 wikipedia pages. To mee seems that 90% of the functionality of the three types are in common, and all respect and completely fall in the definition of &quot;Computer Aided Design&quot;. I spent a lot of time searching for lists, sorting lists, adding to the old lists, picking from discussion lists, hoping other users complete my work, filling the missing link, correct the wrong link and add other contribute. Surely not a simple two seconds destructive revert. Next time, first of all try to use the discussion instead.--[[User:Efa2|Efa2]] ([[User talk:Efa2|talk]]) 15:44, 28 September 2008 (UTC)

: as I stated here and in your discussion page, I am willing to cooperate in creating the appropriate list to have CAD, EDA artistic cad lists, or to make this list evolve to include all, but in that case the type of software would have to be mentionned in the array. I am not against open source at all, i think I mentionned that also in your discussion page. You neaarly doubled the list with 80% of the software either not in there place, or with wrong links. as I stated I kept the historic of the modifications so that your editions are not lost, but only not present in current version.
: As for your comment that eda, cad  and artistic 3D design are 80% the same I very strongly disagree. 
: My first intention was to correct your edits and add an entry in the discussion but as I stated, as most was either out of scope or ill formed, I chaned my policy. that know this is rude, and that's why i also commented in your discussion page . sorry if i have hurt you . --[[User:Dwarfpower|Dwarfpower]] ([[User talk:Dwarfpower|talk]]) 18:29, 28 September 2008 (UTC)

== Time for a cleanup ==
I've linked to the non existent comparisons: [[Comparison of CAD editors for CAM]] and [[Comparison of CAD editors for CAE]]. Hope fully we can use them to move some software away which is not AEC related. I'm sorry I didn't make the original title more specific to start with. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 22:30, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

= Archived discussion =
Put old discussion down here so we can see the new stuff. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 22:30, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

= Candidates for removal =
I think we should remove Advanced Concrete and Advanced Steel. From my quick reading they are both extensions to AutoCAD, so they are not actually CAD packages on their own. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 21:08, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
:done --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 23:45, 27 December 2008 (UTC)

Hi, here is a list of clearly non-AEC software (they are rather mechanical or engineering oriented) I would recommend for removal :
- BRL-CAD
- CATIA
- Digital Project (based on CATIA)
- Both FreeCAD
- Autodesk Inventor
- NX
- Pro/Engineer
- Shark FX
- Solid Edge
- Solidworks
- Varicad
- ViaCAD

Generally speaking it is two different worlds. One easy way to make the difference is to look at the file formats : software looking for STEP, IGES, CATIA, Solidworks or ProE compatibility are not AEC software.

In the remaining list we should further think to make the difference between BIM applications (AllPlan, ArchiCAD, Revit) using intelligent objects and focused on AEC and CAD software drawing lines, circles... and 3D shapes but not specific for AEC  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:LogicielCAO|LogicielCAO]] ([[User talk:LogicielCAO|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/LogicielCAO|contribs]]) 09:56, 26 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Open source vs. proprietary==
The items in the &quot;Open source?&quot; column in this article's table are colored differently depending on whether the software is open source or not. I have two complaints about this:

1. Green represents open source, and magenta represents proprietary. Usually on Wikipedia, green represents &quot;true&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;good&quot;, and anything towards red is &quot;false&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;bad&quot;. This leads me to believe that this article is not neutral enough. Removing the coloring would make it neutral.
2. The column itself is titled &quot;Open source?&quot; rather than &quot;License&quot;, further affecting the neutrality.

:someone has dealt with this, I agree with the issue, but miss the colour coding. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] ([[User talk:DuLithgow|talk]]) 13:54, 29 October 2009 (UTC)
