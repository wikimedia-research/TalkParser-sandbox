Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, introducing inappropriate pages, such as [[:Eduard is a gypsy]], is not in accordance with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]]. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. Under [[WP:CSD#G3|section G3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], the page has been nominated for deletion. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Eduard is a gypsy|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-vandalism-notice --&gt; [[User:Kolbasz|Kolbasz]] ([[User talk:Kolbasz|talk]]) 16:48, 17 June 2015 (UTC)
