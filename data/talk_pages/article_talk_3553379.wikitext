In Spider-Woman I#15, the Shroud conjectures that his 
darkness powers (which he did not display or know that 
he had in Super-Villain Team-Up#5-12, his only 
previous appearances before he appeared in 
Spider-Woman stories written by Mark Gruenwald) were 
bestowed upon him by the Kiss of Kali during his 
training in Nepal but that his teachers never got 
around to telling him about them (because the Shroud 
ran into the snow to douse a bad scalding that 
resulted when, during his graduation ceremony, the 
brand of Kali was placed on his face; this lack of stoic reserve 
was seen as flinching). That would suggest that Shaya did indeed give Gruenwald the idea 
to give the Shrould darkness powers.

Are her powers related in any way? --[[Special:Contributions/186.220.133.223|186.220.133.223]] ([[User talk:186.220.133.223|talk]]) 20:25, 16 May 2011 (UTC)

== No citations, no inclusion. No exception ==

I've removed the crufty listing of characters who someone thinks uses Darkforce. None of them are cited as such and, until we have references from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] ''explicitly'' noting that the character uses darkforce, they cannot return to the article. Wikipedia is not a repository of cruft or original thought. - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]]) 02:27, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
:I see that I noted this months and months ago, and yet it seems like no one reads the talk page. Unless a secondary source '''explicitly''' notes the character's use of darkforce, we cannot even mention it. - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]]) 19:11, 13 June 2014 (UTC)

::Your recent [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=612400141&amp;oldid=612397530 removal] removed some with sources and some without sources, so that wasn't helpful. Furthermore, you did not wait the normal amount of time for other editors to make changes. WAIT. [[User:Spidey104|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''Spidey'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Spidey104#top|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''104''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:12, 13 June 2014 (UTC)
:::First of all, I waited ''three months'', Spidey; I would offer that if someone didn't have the time to add references once tagged, neither the references nor interested contributors could be found. If you are going to cite the material that ''explicitly'' notes the characters as using darkforce (''and not our observation that they ''appear'' to be using such''), then I can wait. 
:::This would exclude most sourcing to comic and issue, unless - and this is important - they explicitly note the darkforce power. If it doesn't do that, we cannot use the issue as reference for the claim. I certainly hope you aren't sourcing these darkforce claims to other wikia that offer up claims of darkforce. 
:::As I've said before, there is no hurry, but the point is that uncited information should not be in the article, no matter what kind of article it is. [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]]) 00:55, 14 June 2014 (UTC)

::::How does [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=607844865&amp;oldid=607735311 May] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=607844865 10th] to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=612400141&amp;oldid=612397530 June 10th] constitute three months? (You even admitted in that edit summary that you ''&quot;gave you guys a month&quot;''.)
::::Did you look at the revisions I did a few days ago? I didn't reference other Wikia and I am offended that you are not assuming good faith on my part. I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=612800745&amp;oldid=612800385 added references from other Wikipedia articles], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=612800385&amp;oldid=612800201 removed the unverifiable characters], or [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=612802574&amp;oldid=612802467 left it for future work].

:::::Sorry, I should have listed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=602050017&amp;oldid=602049899 the DIFF], dated March 30, 2014. Then I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkforce&amp;diff=607866796&amp;oldid=607846156 posted again in May] asking that citations note explicitly that the named characters use darkforce. It's now mid-June, and you've stepped up a bit with references from comic books, which is good (and also why I've been waiting instead of reverting), so I am not really getting your being offended at my AGF. You got it, because the refs you've added remain in. I am not even inclined to check the actual comics, though I am sure someone else will, eventually (would you believe that some contributors cheat and use the Marvel wikia instead of actually checking the source?). 
:::::Frankly, ''I'm'' a bit offended that you didn't check the edit history before assuming I couldn't calculate the passage of time. Tell, you what let's both set aside our bruised egos and move on with life. :) - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]]) 03:59, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
