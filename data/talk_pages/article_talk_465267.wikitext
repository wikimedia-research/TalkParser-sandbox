I have descriptions of how the eight casualties died, which use generic English ranks -- &quot;enlisted man,&quot; &quot;chief,&quot; &amp;c., without giving names.  I also have a list of names:
* ''Capitán de Fragata'' Daniel Nieva Rodríguez
* ''Teniente Segundo'' Luis Roca Sara
* ''Técnico 2do.'' Orlando Valdez Pacheco
* ''Técnico 3ro.'' Carlos Orosco León
* ''Técnico 3ro.'' Rigoberto Gonzales Pisfil
* ''Técnico 3ro.'' Walter García Morales
* ''Oficial de Mar 1ro.'' Juan Oré Rojas
* ''Oficial de Mar 2do.'' Carlos Grande Rengifo
I can map Nieva's, Sara's, and Grande's names to their death scenes.  The remaining five, however -- the three who died of exposure and the two who drowned or were asphyxiated -- are kicking my butt, in part because none of my sources translate the ''técnico'' ranks properly.  Can anyone help? --[[User:The Epopt|the Epopt]] 22:21, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)
