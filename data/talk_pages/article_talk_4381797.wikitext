== Merge into [[Agile Gracile Opossum]] ==

This article is about the animal know as ''Gracilinanus agilis'', the [[Agile Gracile Opossum]]. WP should not have 2 articles on the same species that are only differentiated by a different taxonomic source. MSW3 (2005) does not recognize this taxonomy from 2004. There is no need to have a duplicate article. --[[User:Tombstone|Tombstone]] ([[User talk:Tombstone|talk]]) 06:06, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:They are decidedly distinct species (and genera). MSW 3 was out of date when it was published. I will revert your change. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 06:45, 22 September 2008 (UTC)
:Also note that MSW 3 does recognise this as a species distinct from ''G. agilis'' (the &quot;Pygmy Opossum&quot;, ''Gracilinanus formosus''). The 2004 paper describing a new genus simply came too late to be included by Gardner. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 06:48, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

::Please do not remove the merge proposal before an actual discussion can occur; I re-added the template for the time being. Question: Is [http://research.amnh.org/mammalogy/personnel/voss/VossGardner&amp;Jansa2004.pdf this] the source you were using, it was the only hit Yahoo! returned. Rgrds. --[[User:Tombstone|Tombstone]] ([[User talk:Tombstone|talk]]) 07:35, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:::Yes. And I do not see why a discussion should occur when the proposal is clearly wrong, as in this case. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 15:46, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

::::Well, they only had one specimen to study and it was 83 years old. On page 7, under the heading &quot;Phylogenetic Relationships&quot;, they admit &quot;our very limited material is a significant problem&quot;. The proposal uses &quot;application[s] of missing-entry replacement&quot; that &quot;can sometimes yield spurious results that are not supported by any observable data&quot; &lt;nowiki&gt;[page 15]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. As far as I can tell, there has been no additional studies done on this to corroborate the claim. That is why I am thinking WP should not call this a species as of yet.

It is no longer known only from the holotype. Furthermore, MSW 3 already recognized it as a separate species, as I noted before, and we do not have to judge if a particular taxonomic change was correct: there are taxonomists who do that.

We should be following MSW3, unless there is a preponderance of post-MSW3 evidence. The merge should be dropped. - [[User:UtherSRG|UtherSRG]] [[User_talk:UtherSRG|(talk)]] 14:07, 24 September 2008 (UTC)
