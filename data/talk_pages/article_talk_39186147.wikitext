;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
* [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]] – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] – this is one of Wikipedia's core policies.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|living person]] to any Wikipedia page and follow [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons policy]]. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Help:Introduction to referencing/1|referenced]] with multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].

* If you are testing, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]] to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so]&lt;/span&gt;.
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], [[WP:ARTSPAM|advertising]] or [[WP:NOTADVERTISING|promotional messages]], and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]; doing so will result in your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].
* Do not use talk pages as discussion or forum pages as Wikipedia is [[WP:NOT#FORUM|not a forum]].

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on [[User talk:Theroadislong|my talk page]]. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date).
