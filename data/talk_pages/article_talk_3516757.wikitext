== Re: Image: Pastor Troy.jpg ==

Thanks for contacting me, I'm now aware of the mistake of the Pastor Troy article and the next time I will use the '''fairuse''' tag on my next uploads. [[user:LILVOKA|LILVOKA]] 14:33, 2005 November 29 (UTC)
That's alright, I am not too worried about it, [[user:B Touch| B Touch]] will get a better qaulity picture for it. We're cool, thanks, I appreciate it, go ahead and delete it. [[user:LILVOKA|LILVOKA]] 15:34, 2005 December 1 (UTC)

I've put the PD tag at the image + credits. You can now remove the 'no source' template. As to my previous message to User talk:Superm401, I don't know what happened to it. Just as you, I can't find it back in his archives. Well it doesn't matter anymore.  [[User:JoJan|JoJan]] 14:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)


==RE: Image Tagging [[:Image:Plarry.jpg]]==

There are no terms. The image came from a defunct South American magazine from the 1980's, so I guess deletion would be in order.

== Re: Image Tagging [[:Image:Pleasantville.JPG|Image:Pleasantville.JPG]] ==

Hi, I would like to be able to comply with your request, but I don't know how.  I had noted that it was a copy of a portion of a city map (St. John's).  I don't know how to otherwise explain how I got it. I would suggest that it get removed if copyright is compromised. [[User:HJKeats|HJKeats]] 12:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

It's cool... you can delete that one. I uploaded when I first started with the project. - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 13:13, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[B._R._Ambedkar]] ==

Hello, the image you removed from subject article was uploaded by an anon ip in May 2005.  Since the photo is of someone who lived from 1891-1956, I'd request you replace the photo in the article using [[Image_copyright_tags#Fair_use_images_of_unknown_copyright_status| Fairold]] TIA. --[[User:FRS|FRS]] 15:05, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Firstly, a quick factual correction: the B. R. Ambedkar image wasn't uploaded by an anonymous IP: it was uploaded by Praneeth11, as the page history clearly shows.

:Onto the more substantive issue: the copyright on a photo belongs to the photographer, and will (in general) expire 70 years after the death of the photographer (in the US and the EU, anyway). Hence I think it's more than possible that it is still covered by copyright and as such can't be used on Wikipedia. Without some form of definitive evidence that the image is no longer covered by copyright, I think the best thing to do is to delete the image.

:There's also now a technical issue: the image has now been deleted from Wikipedia, and (unlike articles) backups of images aren't kept in the database, so the only way to restore the image now would be from a backup of the database. --Pak21 15:26, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::Well, I attributed the pic to an anon because of this diff [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B._R._Ambedkar&amp;oldid=13930605] which is a few minutes before [[Praneethill]]'s edit.  
::I understand the duration of copyrights, but a reasonable [[Fair_use]] analysis, should be applied as well, especially when we're talking about a 50+ year old photograph of an historic figure. --[[User:FRS|FRS]] 16:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

==Image Tagging [[:Image:Pobednik-kalis.jpg]]==
Hi. This picture you can find on [http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201351 Belgrade official site], and it is public domain. I take it from there. Please put relevant template on picture. Thank you. Best regards. --[[User:Pokrajac|M. Pokrajac]] 16:49, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
:We on Serbian Wikipedia have letter form webamster of this web site. Wikipedia can use anything from this site. --[[User:Pokrajac|M. Pokrajac]] 11:12, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
::Yes, ofcourse!:) --[[User:Pokrajac|M. Pokrajac]] 12:00, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

==Image Tagging [[:Image:Pm nehru.jpg]]==

All I did with this image was scale/compress it a bit. The original may have been a .png or something; I don't recall. At any rate, I know nothing about its copyright status, and have no particular attachment to it. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 22:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Re: Image Tagging [[:Image:Perlin noise.jpg]] ==

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  I created the image and have modified the image text to reflect this. [[User:Reedbeta|Reedbeta]] 01:43, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

== pikachu images ==

I redid the images, and i added the source of where I found the images. Thank you. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jsmith|Jsmith]] ([[User talk:Jsmith|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsmith|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

==Pontiac Solstice Image==
Thank you for notifying me about the image. I am currently trying to look for sources. If I do find that it's copyrighted to only the Pontiac website, I'll let it be removed on Wikipedia. Next time I put in a picture, I'll cite my sources. I'll probably get a press release photo of the Solstice to replace it. If you have anything regarding the picture, please leave a message in my discussion page. Thanks again.           --[[User:The Helper S|The Helper S]]

==Ogg files deleted==

I don't upload files unless I have created them myself or have permission. Nonetheless, some ogg files I apparently uploaded have been deleted, and now I can't even find the article they link to. It seems to me to be utterly irresponsible to delete these files and then not even give the information I need to fix the problem. In the future an emailed heads up would be nice. 

WHERE, please, are Permean.ogg, Pereq.ogg and Perwolf.ogg? [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 19:01, 1 April 2006 (UTC)


You said &quot;As for what can be done about it now, the unfortunate answer is &quot;not very much&quot;. The images were deleted by an administrator on 28 December; unlike articles, no backup copy is kept on the Wikipedia servers, so unless you (or possibly another user) has a copy, they cannot be restored.&quot; They could be restored in the sense of offering a replacement if I knew the article they linked to. Why wasn't I at least told that? [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 19:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
