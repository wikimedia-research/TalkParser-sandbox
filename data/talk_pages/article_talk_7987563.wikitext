See my note at the Together 4 ever page. Wikipedia is not a chat service. See that page for various non-Wikipedia alternatives you may wish to consider. [[User:JoshuaZ|JoshuaZ]] 17:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

: Also, if you don't change your password (since you put it in the open) I will block this account indefinitely. For security and accountability reasons Wikipedia cannot have open accounts. I will check again tonight (EST) and if the password is still identical I will block this account indefinitely. I have left this account unblocked for now so that either of you can leave questions on my talk page if you wish to know more about Wikipedia policy or require any other form of assistance.
