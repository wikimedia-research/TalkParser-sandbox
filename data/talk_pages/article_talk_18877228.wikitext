== First Western act to tour behind the Iron Curtain ==

This is an often claimed 'first' by many acts. Here's an Australian act (Christie) claiming it for 1970, 5 years before the Dooleys' claim for 1975: http://www.yellowriver.0catch.com/facts.html
I've removed the claim in this article seeing as it is unsourced and contested. [[User:Vauxhall1964|Vauxhall1964]] ([[User talk:Vauxhall1964|talk]]) 10:48, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

== The inclusion of Bernie Bentall ==

Hey Dooley fans worldwide. Just opening a discussion on whether Bernie Bentall should be included. On the one hand he wasn't a Dooley and famously refused to change his name to Dooley. But then again, he did teach Steve &quot;The Fingers&quot; Dooley his favourite chord, triangle.
