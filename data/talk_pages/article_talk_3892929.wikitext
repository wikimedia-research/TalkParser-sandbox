==Speedy deletion of [[:Image:Fox34.jpg]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Image:Fox34.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#I9|section I9 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the image appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted images or text borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Image:Fox34.jpg|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:Image:Fox34.jpg|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-dbimgcopyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Kanonkas|&lt;b&gt;'''Kanonkas'''&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Kanonkas|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#accC10;background:#0000fa;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 10:44, 6 August 2008 (UTC)
