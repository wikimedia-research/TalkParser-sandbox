A tag has been placed on [[:Abnormality (band)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a band or musician, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Abnormality (band)|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Karl 334|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:Blue&quot;&gt;'''Karl 334'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Karl 334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''Talk-''&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Karl_334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''-Contribs''&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:24, 10 April 2012 (UTC)
==Removing Speedy at [[Abnormality (band)]]==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia, thank you for taking the time to create a page here. It might not have been your intention, but you recently removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from a page you created yourself. Because Wikipedia policy [[WP:CSD|does not allow]] the creator of the page to remove deletion tags, an [[WP:BOT|automated program]] has replaced the deletion tag you removed from [[:Abnormality (band)]]. Please do not continue to remove the deletion tag, instead, if you disagree with the deletion, you can follow these steps:
#Go to the page by clicking [[:Abnormality (band)|this link]]. Once there, select the button that says &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:Abnormality (band)}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}} &lt;b style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.
#This will take you to the talk page, where you can make your case by explaining why the page does not meet Wikipedia's [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]].
Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do. For further help about the deletion, you could contact the user who first placed the tag or a [[Wikipedia:Highly Active Users|highly active user]] who is willing to help with deletion. This message was left by a bot, so please do not contact the bot about the deletion. Thank you, - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 21:26, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not remove [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] notices from pages you have created yourself, as you did with [[:Abnormality (band)]]. If you believe the page should not be deleted, you may contest the deletion by clicking on the button that says: '''Click here to contest this speedy deletion''', which appears inside the speedy deletion notice. This will allow you to make your case '''''on the article's [[Talk:Abnormality (band)|talk page]]'''''. Administrators will consider your reasoning before deciding what to do with the article. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy2 --&gt; - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 21:27, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:The Collective Calm in Mortal Oblivion]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A9|section A9 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a musical recording which does not indicate why its subject is important or significant, and where the artist's article has never existed, has been deleted or is eligible for deletion itself. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (music)|notability guideline for music]].&lt;!-- Template:Db-a9-notice --&gt; 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:The Collective Calm in Mortal Oblivion|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Karl 334|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:Blue&quot;&gt;'''Karl 334'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Karl 334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''Talk-''&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Karl_334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''-Contribs''&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 19:58, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is your '''last warning'''. The next time you create an inappropriate page, as you did at [[:The Collective Calm in Mortal Oblivion]], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]] without further notice'''. {{Z46}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-create4 --&gt; [[User:Karl 334|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:Blue&quot;&gt;'''Karl 334'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Karl 334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''Talk-''&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Karl_334|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''-Contribs''&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 19:59, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot; style=&quot;min-height: 40px&quot;&gt; [[Image:Stop x nuvola.svg|40px|left|alt=|link=]] You have been '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]]''' '''indefinitely''' from editing, because you have made it clear that you intend to continue to use Wikipedia only for promotional purposes, and to attempt to evade deletion and creation-protection of an article by re-creating the same content under a different title. If you think that there are good reasons why you should be unblocked, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|2=reason=''Your reason here &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''}}, but you should read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first.

{{unblock reviewed | = I won't make any more pages for that band, I'll just edit other pages.  If someone does make the page for that band, I'll edit it if necessary, and remove anything that could be considered just advertising.  Please uplift my ban!}}

{{unblock reviewed | 1=Please uplift my ban because I'm really tired of waiting. I just want to be able to edit articles, and I won't make that article again. Just uplift the ban!! [[User:Superawezome|Superawezome]] ([[User talk:Superawezome#top|talk]]) 23:59, 12 April 2012 (UTC) | decline=I am declining your unblock request because it does not address the reason for your block, or because it is inadequate for other reasons. To be unblocked, you must convince the reviewing administrator(s) that 
*the block is not necessary to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia, &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt;
*the block is no longer necessary because you
*#understand what you have been blocked for,
*#will not continue to cause damage or disruption, and
*#will make useful contributions instead.

Whoa there, you can't just say that to get yourself unblocked. Maybe if you pledged to not make inappropriate pages (i.e. Almost all the pages you have created) you might get unblocked. We won't unblock you because you are tired of waiting. We also need you to read a few key policies:
1. [[WP:NOTABILITY|Notability]]- Subjects need to have sufficient notability ( judged by how many items ''reliable'' sources write about them) to be allowed here.
2. [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]]- Wikipedia is not here for you to create an article to get attention for your band/company/whatever.
3. [[WP:COI|Conflict of interest]]- Be very careful about editing articles in which you are close to/are the subject, as you may have a potentially biased point of view (no offense).
If you are able to understand those three policies, and make a convincing unblock request that also shows that you can work constructively, you might get unblocked. Good luck.

{{unblock reviewed | 1=Okay, I won't make any more inappropriate pages. I ''am'' tired of waiting, but I'm also not going to whine about it anymore. I won't create any pages for that band (although they are not '''my''' band, as '''Thekillerpenguin''' said before). I won't create huge paragraphs in articles I edit, as I was never going to do this. [[User:Superawezome|Superawezome]] ([[User talk:Superawezome#top|talk]]) 17:29, 16 April 2012 (UTC) | decline=One open request at a time, please. — [[User:Daniel Case|Daniel Case]] ([[User talk:Daniel Case|talk]]) 19:09, 17 April 2012 (UTC)}}

Patience is a virtue, and it is your ''own'' fault that you got blocked (ignoring warnings), so therefore it's ''your'' fault you have to wait.  So far, there's 1 edit to your name that may or may not be positive overall.  This is not a good ratio.  However, I believe everyone has something to add to this project.  Could you give us a sample of the types of articles you wish to edit and the types of additions you're thinking of making.  Make sure you show us the [[WP:RS|sources]] you're getting the info from. ([[User talk:Bwilkins|&lt;font style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;talk→&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Bwilkins|BWilkins]]&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/span&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Bwilkins|&lt;font style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;←track&lt;/font&gt;]]) 10:34, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

{{unblock reviewed | 1=I understand. My changes won't be very large, what I mostly plan to do is find low-resolution pictures (mostly album covers), and swap them out for higher-res pictures. Also, for the cover of ''Sorry for Party Rocking'' by LMFAO, the cover shown is the deluxe version, not the standard. I'll definitely change that. | accept=Alright. Unblocked for sheer persistence. I think by now you know what not to do, but here's another: don't go around sticking in high-quality scans of album covers--it does not jive with the fair use policy for non-free content. Be mindful of the comments and suggestions above: you're probably on a tight least; good luck. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 01:48, 19 April 2012 (UTC)}}
