== Phebe McPherson == 
Phebe McPherson was the first woman ordained in the Episcopal Church in Maryland in 1977, McPherson has developed and serves as head minister of a multiracial congregation in the Balt/Wash metropolitan area. She has raised millions of dollars to build a children’s center, restore the only WWI chapel &amp; museum in the United States, and produces a jazz &amp; R&amp;B coffeehouse with Jim Ballard, nephew of John Coltrane. She serves as a member of the Legacy of Slavery in Maryland Commission appointed by the Governor.

After almost 40 years of writing and producing, Phebe McPherson has set her sights on the development of a first-class musical combining a tragic love story that exposes the devastating consequences of racial injustice with stunning compositions performed by the late jazz trumpeter, Donald Byrd. The plot and themes of the true story about a white repair shop foreman and a young black seamstress are shaped by William Shakespeare’s “The Winter’s Tale.”
Passion for Racial Justice has been the centerpiece of her work. 

 Her doctoral work on racial reconciliation and church membership development is scheduled to be published this year. It was inspired, like this musical, by the writings of Dr. Howard Thurman, spiritual mentor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Credits McPherson’s credits include a short film on slavery reparations, “Time to Love,” featured at Lambeth Conference (England, 2008), an original musical, “The Galilean Accent” (Baltimore, 1983), and an ongoing series of one-acts about public figures including Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Dave Brubeck, and Nelson Mandela.
Personal She is married to The Rev. Bruce McPherson. Her son, Samuel Coe, is Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan.
