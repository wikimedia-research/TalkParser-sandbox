Exetasi: I submitted this article when class was ending and I did not have time to completely finish the article, and did not want to lose the minor amount of work I contributed to it. I plan on adding more in a few hours after I get back from work, and until then, I see no reason for it to be deleted.

Isn't it a little ridiculous to call Devo Keenan a &quot;member&quot; of this &quot;band&quot; simply because he supposedly played on one song?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.179.172.226|68.179.172.226]] ([[User talk:68.179.172.226|talk]]) 15:53, 29 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

^ I agree, we might as well add Paz, Johnette, and Matt to the lineup. [[User:Lovetoadmire|Lovetoadmire]] ([[User talk:Lovetoadmire|talk]]) 06:40, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
