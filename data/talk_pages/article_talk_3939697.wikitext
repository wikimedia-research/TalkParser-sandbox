You uploaded this image and tagged it with {{tl|PD-release}} - which indicates you have the copyright holder's permission to release it. If this is the case you need to provide supporting evidence for this. If you took the photo you can change the license to {{tl|PD-self}} and state that it is your own work in the image summary. If this is the case for other images you've uploaded you may want to consider changing their tags as well. Best wishes.  [[User:Madmedea|Madmedea]] 10:25, 18 May 2007 (UTC)
==[[Oligodon woodmasoni]]==
On the article it is mentioned that the holotype was lost and that a new one has been &quot;lodged&quot; at the ZSI. Could it be clarified if that was a neotype designation. Thanks [[User:Shyamal|Shyamal]] ([[User talk:Shyamal|talk]]) 09:08, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
