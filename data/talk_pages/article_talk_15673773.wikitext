==Assessment review==
Article seems to have good detail about many parts, and is generally well referenced. 

* The population statistics section is confusing - please create a graph or something rather than using a row of ||||s
* Transport, Education and Sports sections need to be expanded.
* Many sections have too many subsections for the content, for instance the history and attractions sections.

Generally good though, I was surprised by how much information is on this page. -''[[User:Mattbuck|mattbuck]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattbuck|Talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 9 February 2008 (UTC)
