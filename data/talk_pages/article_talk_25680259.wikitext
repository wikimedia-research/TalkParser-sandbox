I suppose you can cite it as &quot;mjponso on Wikipedia.&quot;  Which image are you referring to, the one I posted of Lake Mead / Hoover Dam?  And what publication, may I ask, will this be included in?  (Sorry for getting back to you so late...I haven't logged in on Wikipedia in a little while.)

My email address is mjponso AT gmail.com.  I'd be curious to see whether this is a serious academic / intellectual publication. --[[User:Mjponso|Mjponso]] ([[User talk:Mjponso|talk]]) 19:26, 14 January 2010 (UTC)
