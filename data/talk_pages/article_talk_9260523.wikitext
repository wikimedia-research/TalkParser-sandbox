==What's going on?==
Hey, how's it going? I'm actually only barely acquainted with Bobby, although I knew J.D. in highschool.

Yes, times have been crazy lately. Tell me about yourself! I gather (from my mom, who talks to your mom) that you're J.D. and Bobby's older brother, and (from your user page) that you're stationed in Japan? How's that treating you? What is your job in the navy? Us Kenneths ought to stick together :)

Tell me, do we have any common wikipedia interests? Maybe we should work together on an article!
