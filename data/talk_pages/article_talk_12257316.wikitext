Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Promo nash.jpg]]'''. However, there is a concern that the rationale you have provided for using this image under &quot;fair use&quot; may be invalid. Please read the instructions at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] carefully, then go to [[:Image:Promo nash.jpg|the image description page]] and clarify why you think the image qualifies for fair use. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use, it will be deleted after  seven days according to our [[WP:CSD#Images/media|Criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:No fair --&gt;[[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 14:50, 19 July 2007 (UTC)
==Orphaned non-free image (Image:Promo nash.jpg)==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Promo nash.jpg]]'''. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, the image is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free images not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Orphaned --&gt; [[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 10:57, 20 July 2007 (UTC)
