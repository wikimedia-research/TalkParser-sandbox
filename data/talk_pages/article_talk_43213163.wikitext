Hi there, I'm [[User:HasteurBot|HasteurBot]]. I just wanted to let you know that [[Draft:Omniscient (hacktivist)]], a page you created, has not been edited in 6 months.  The Articles for Creation space is not an indefinite storage location for content that is not appropriate for articlespace.

==Your draft article, [[Draft:Omniscient (hacktivist)]]==

Hello Habiler. It has been over six months since you last edited your [[WP:AFC]] draft article submission, entitled &quot;[[Draft:Omniscient (hacktivist)|Omniscient]]&quot;. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|Draft:Omniscient (hacktivist)|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note that Articles for Creation is not for indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia [[WP:mainspace|mainspace]].

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, you can request its undeletion by one of two methods (don't do both): 1) follow the instructions at [[WP:REFUND/G13]], ''or'' 2) copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Draft:Omniscient (hacktivist)&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, and click &quot;Save page&quot;. An administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:JMHamo|JMHamo]] ([[User talk:JMHamo|talk]]) 21:50, 27 January 2015 (UTC)
