[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Torreslfchero|Torreslfchero]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/67.0.232.97|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Education_Association?diff=542668589 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:National Education Association]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Torreslfchero|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Torreslfchero|Torreslfchero]] ([[User talk:Torreslfchero|talk]]) 21:00, 7 March 2013 (UTC)
