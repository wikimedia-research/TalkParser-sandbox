[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|alt=|link=]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|alt=|link=]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;The page [[:Mofara]] has been speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page appeared to be blatant advertising which only promotes something, and which is unlikely to be suitable for an article (or at best would need a fundamental rewrite). Wikipedia is not a medium for promotion of anything, whether a company, product, group, service, person, religious or political belief, or anything else. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item G11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. &lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn-deletion --&gt; [[User:NawlinWiki|NawlinWiki]] ([[User talk:NawlinWiki|talk]]) 22:52, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Mofara]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A3|section A3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an article with no content whatsoever, or whose contents consist only of external links, a &quot;See also&quot; section, book references, category tags, template tags, interwiki links, a rephrasing of the title, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content.

Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Mofara|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontent-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Andyjsmith|andy]] ([[User talk:Andyjsmith|talk]]) 23:04, 5 December 2011 (UTC)
