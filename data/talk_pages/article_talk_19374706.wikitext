== Fair use rationale for Image:Pyat rublei 1997.jpg ==

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Pyat rublei 1997.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Pyat rublei 1997.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

== Soviet Goods &amp; Impact Sections ==

The &quot;Soviet Goods&quot; section is wrong. That's for the 1940 agreement. It came from a letter that used to be cited on this page that was moved to the appropriate article (1940 agreement). This section should probably be deleted.

The &quot;Impact&quot; section is unsourced and contains some not exactly accurate very broad claims.  It probably should be deleted, as well.[[User:Mosedschurte|Mosedschurte]] ([[User talk:Mosedschurte|talk]]) 11:54, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

{{DYK talk|9 February|2009|entry=... that in the aftermath of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed three economic agreements: '''[[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|in 1939]], [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|in 1940]]''' and '''[[German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement|in 1941]]'''?|views=701}}

== Comment ==

The sentence &quot;The Soviet Union also agreed to act as an intermediary in order to procure war material Germany needed but that the Soviets could not indigenously produce.&quot; needs to be supported by evidence. In fact, i consider it highly desireable to have the original text of the agreement, whether translated into English or not, linked to from this page.

== Food fats ==

I am probably stupid, but what's &quot;food fat&quot;? I understand &quot;importing oil,&quot; but &quot;food fat&quot;? It's just weird... [[User:Renata3|Renata]] ([[User talk:Renata3|talk]]) 07:27, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

:A broad category of [[fat]] materials used in food.  Germany had to import a larger percentage of food fats and food oils.  The category would include [[Vegetable fats and oils]] and [[animal fat]]. [[User:Mosedschurte|Mosedschurte]] ([[User talk:Mosedschurte|talk]]) 07:45, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
==Clarification needed==
Wording in lead mislead:) Text actually belonged to [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)]] which conclued after September 28 1939 endorsment of the 19 agreemant, after long lasted negotiations and discource between both party ended February 5 1940 after Ribbentrope letter. Need to be clarified and all irrelevant text shortened or removed. Thanks [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 16:02, 10 January 2010 (UTC)
==Renaming/ clarifiaction needed==
Per official name - Credit Agreement of August 19, 1939 used many times here Documents On German Foreign Policy 1918 1945 [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 09:53, 13 January 2010 (UTC)

: Most English sources use the other name [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/ns059.asp]. I suggest you revert yourself and open a discussion on a possible renaming.

==Sources misused==
Again and in same way as in [[Basis Nord]], [[German cruiser Lützow (Hipper class)]], [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–1941)]] (just one first catched instance-[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jo0doe#German.E2.80.93Soviet_Credit_Agreement_.281939.29]).
*Picture Gallery - which all of that pictures are depict here? Again [[Ju-90]] 18 build -  [[Me-109]]G-8 of 1943 (really lack of DDR 1956 workers:)) - if sign picture as here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Latvian_Non-Aggression_Pact]  not available - no picture needed at all. Even guess why [[Anastas Mikoyan]] not here?  [[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 10:10, 31 January 2010 (UTC)
* At Wegner, p. 99 [4] 
The Credit Agreement between the German Reich and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics gave the Soviet Union an acceptance credit of 200 million RM over 7 years with an affective interest rate of 4.5 percent. The credit line was to be used during the next two years for purchase of capital goods in Germany and was to be paid off by means of Soviet material shipment from 1946 onwards.
:so what given in article?
Wegner, p. 101 

''Immediately before the outbreak of the war in 1939 the Military Economic Staff in the Wehrmacht (Wehrwirtschaftstab) High Command although thought that Germany could only be really from a blockade on the basis of close economic cooperation with the Soviet Union.''
in article

''The Wehrmacht High Command issued a report that Germany could only be safe from a blockade on the basis of close economic cooperation with the Soviet Union''.[[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 20:28, 31 January 2010 (UTC)
*in article 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On July 25, the Soviet Union and Germany were very close to finalizing the terms of a proposed economic deal
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
at source given
''the first few encounters relatively minor. 25 July.. they were still a half percent apart on interest rate'' (remember - a Credit agreement)[[User:Jo0doe|Jo0doe]] ([[User talk:Jo0doe|talk]]) 20:44, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

==Article need to be completely rewritten ==
in stile of [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] - and add &quot;Modern assessment controversy&quot; section  – per Ericson data for existing of such three assessment approach-
* add text for &quot;Dispositionsfähigkeit des Geldes&quot; Nazi policy . Briefly mention [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] to Germany
a bunch of really nice sources available even not copyrighted - like
[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/nsa619.asp]- borrowed from    Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918-1945. Series D (1937-1945) Washington, D.C.: U.S. Gov. Printing Office, 1949-64
