===Your edits to [[July 11]]===
Dear [[User:63.224.248.247|63.224.248.247]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px]]
Some of your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=July_11&amp;diff=223626073&amp;oldid=223615589 edits] on the page 
[[July 11]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: The person you added doesn't seem to have a Wikipedia page.
If the page exists, check that you've spelled and capitalized the name the same way as the article, and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you [[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-PseudoBot1 --&gt; [[User:PseudoBot|PseudoBot]] ([[User talk:PseudoBot|talk]]) 23:23, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
