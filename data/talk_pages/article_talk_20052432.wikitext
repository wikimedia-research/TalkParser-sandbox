== Heinlein's use in colloquial slang in fiction ==

Title say it all really. I don't have all the Heinlein novels I used to but I'll thumb through the ones I have for confirmation, but this is one of those things he used like &quot;grok&quot; or &quot;there ain't no such thing as a free lunch&quot;. Tell me someone knows what I'm talking about. The only reason I had any idea what stet meant was by Heinlein's usage, and I wonder if it is notable.[[User:Lazarus Plus|Lazarus Plus]] ([[User talk:Lazarus Plus|talk]]) 09:36, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
