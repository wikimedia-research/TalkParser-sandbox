[[Image:Nuvola apps personal.png|25px]] You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved{{#if:|, as you did at [[:{{{1}}}]]}}. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. 

Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|article about yourself]] is ''strongly'' discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on [[wikipedia:articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not ''start'' articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to [[Wikipedia:No original research]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. 

If you are not [[WP:notability|&quot;notable&quot;]] under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_social_networking.2C_or_memorial_site|Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider]] and would thus qualify for [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#a7|speedy deletion]].  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. (See [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles]].)  {{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Marasmusine|Marasmusine]] ([[User talk:Marasmusine|talk]]) 09:42, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
