== foreign volunteers in 1948 ==

Here is what Morris has to say about foreign volunteers in 1948:
:&quot;Of the Arab states, only the Jordanians, who increased their roster of Britons during the war, managed to recruit and deploy foreign military experts to any real effect. The handful of ex-Nazi Germans or Bosnian Muslims recruited by Syria, Egypt, and the Palestinian Arabs proved of little significance.&quot; (Page 403)
If reputable secondary sources do not consider this contribution to be significant, it really doesn't belong in the info box. [[User:GabrielF|GabrielF]] ([[User talk:GabrielF|talk]]) 16:14, 13 January 2012 (UTC)
:I would not object to the phrase &quot;foreign volunteers&quot; - particularly since there were volunteers from Arab countries not mentioned. I would object to the use of flags or to listing countries of origin in the info box.  [[User:GabrielF|GabrielF]] ([[User talk:GabrielF|talk]]) 17:17, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

The block was based on both behavioral evidence, and checkuser results that are not inconsistent with the conclusion of socking. As to the question why N. send these emails to me, your guess is as good as mine, although I suspect that it has something to do with the relatively small intersection between the set of regular AE admins and the set of SPI clerks.

==What is up my [insert some slur meant in good humor here]==
You know how it is with all of the shit. And I feel that it has gotten to the point where I know better than most admins (since I do) even if I express it poorly. I'm still around but debating if I am going to keep with the clean start or do the frowned upon clean v bad hand accounts. Regardless, the amount of time on has been reduced substantially since I only started poking around on Wikipedia when work was slow. Maybe I will get laid off again and come back with a vengeance! Keep in mind that the I-P area is bogus. I would have been a different editor if I had never gotten involved. I know that you have to care about it but I don't have to. And it all does not matter since we know how it is going to turn out on the ground. All the crying from the hippies won't make a lick of difference. Thanks for the good words. Keep your head up and learn to say &quot;screw it&quot; when they are pushing for something that is ridiculous.

Hi!

My name is Victor and I'm a storyteller with the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that supports Wikipedia. I'm chronicling the inspiring stories of the Wikipedia community around the world, including those from readers, editors, and donors. Stories are absolutely essential for any non-profit to persuade people to support the cause, and we know the vast network of people who make and use Wikipedia have so much to share. I found your username from the Highbeam application list.

I'd very much like the opportunity to interview you to tell your story, with the possibility of using it in our materials, on our community websites, or as part of this year’s fundraiser to encourage others to support Wikipedia. '''Please let me know if you're inclined to take part in the Wikipedia Stories Project, or if you know anyone with whom I should speak.'''

== May 2012 ==

Hi, I see from your edit history that you've sent [[User:Timotheus Canens]] an email. I'm guessing I know what it's about. If you recall, a while back on your Talk page I suggested approaching ARBCOM in the matter of Timotheus Canens' inconsistent enforcement actions and proposals relating to the I/P topic area. Shortly after my message to you, he voluntarily stepped down as Admin without explaining why, hence I didn't pursue the matter further. He then, however, reappeared and demanded his tools back, in the process arguing that he had gone on vacation and making nasty remarks to at least one non-pro-Palestinian editor who sought clarification in his regard. Now with this latest business of Nishidani on top of about a dozen other questionable enforcement actions and proposals he's made since having his Admin tools reinstated, I'm of the opinion there's again an urgent necessity to have ARBCOM examine whether Timotheus Canens needs to be considered a biased Admin in the context of I/P. Please let me know what you think.—[[User:Biosketch|Biosketch]] ([[User talk:Biosketch|talk]]) 17:39, 4 May 2012 (UTC)
:Your comment addresses only a small portion of the demonstrated problematic behavior, which on the face of it, appears blatant. However, I'll reserve further comment until I hear directly from Tim. I'm hoping that there's an innocent explanation and that the pattern merely reflects an unfortunate set of extraordinary coincidences.--[[User:Jiujitsuguy|Jiujitsuguy]] ([[User talk:Jiujitsuguy#top|talk]]) 19:17, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

::Below is compilation of statements regarding the recent Nishidani's 1rr breach:

* '''Sean Hoyland:''' (Supported Nishidani at AE) &quot;... from my perspective your ''(Luke 19 Verse 27's)'' actions caused this (although I'm sure triggering a 1RR violation was not your intent)&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490587225]   
* '''Ed Johnston:''' &quot;Nishidani, unless you see a BLP violation against a named person or an obvious falsification of sources it seems like you should revert your own edit pending discussion.&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EdJohnston&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490321706]

* '''Jiujitsuguy:''' &quot;There was a brightline violation of 1R. The subject editor acknowledged the violation&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490681110]
* '''Floquenbeam:''' &quot;Definitely a 1RR violation...Being right is not a defense for 1RR... I propose a one month I/P topic ban&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490691098]
* '''Stephen Schulz:''' &quot;Mostly agree with T. Canens. This may be a minor infraction&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490685259]
* '''T.Canens:''' If we are sanctioning this 1RR violation, then to me an 24 hour block is the only reasonable sanction. The suggestion of indefinite topic ban is beyond ludicrous...since the topic ban was lifted almost a year ago, Nishidani has not been sanctioned under ARBPIA as far as I can tell. Moreover, '''after looking at the edit...it is not clear to me that a sanction is appropriate at all.'''&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490613808] T.Canens later stated, &quot;Looks like I missed the August and December episodes&quot; after Floquenbeam subsequently [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=490691098 identified] that Nashidini &quot;did something similar in August 2011 and December 2011&quot;.
 
I am of the view that T.Canens grossly unrepresentative assertions served to [[Poisoning the well|poison the well]], were unsound, and indicative of a wider problem concerning his I-P arbitration.&lt;br /&gt;Best Wishes &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:AnkhMorpork|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;Ankh&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]'''.'''[[User talk:AnkhMorpork|&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;Morpork&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 22:49, 5 May 2012 (UTC).

:So AnkhMorpork, since you think that Nishidani ''has'' been sanctioned under ARBPIA since his topic ban was lifted, you should be able to point out exactly when that was, shouldn't you? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ARBPIA#Log_of_blocks_and_bans Here's] the list of ARBPIA log of blocks and bans to help you out. If you can't point out when a sanction was put in place, it won't say very much about your ability to discern the truth will it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but when I asked you in relation to Zero whether it was a matter of concern that a Wikipedia editor was libelled in a Wikipedia article, you said no. Taken together, it maybe indicates you have a bit of a problem in regard to the truth and other editors ... and that's not very promising when you're also making claims about admins being biased, is it?
:At AE, I did not intervene to support Nishidani (as he had specifically asked editors not to do that). I intervened to ask Jiujitsguy to substantiate his claim that other editors have been indeffed for far less.

:I shall amend the above description of your comments, and I shall amend what I wrote regarding subsequent blocks for added clarification.

Apparently in that case he felt that if an editor doesn't self-revert a 1RR violation, administrator action is required regardless of past violations (the editor who was reported didn't even get the ARBPIA warning prior to that report). One has to wonder how he would have &quot;intervene[d] to support Nishidani&quot; if he was not asked not to.

How is he still getting away with this? It is obvious that he is lenient with one &quot;side&quot;. He has made enough comments at AE that we could have a good old fashioned... (well I will stop before engaging in that). Basic point: The balance of comments made for cases involving all too similar scenarios is disconcerting.

You made a unilateral move without consensus. I will AGF and think you overlooked at least three editors who object to removing the bit about UNESCO. Are you going to self-RV? -[[User:Asad112|asad]] ([[User talk:Asad112|talk]]) 03:55, 12 May 2012 (UTC)

:::Your tone is uncalled for. Most of the editors who commented at Talk were supportive of some form of change regarding the weight given to UNESCO's views, whether in the Lead or the infobox. Moreover, my edit was well in line with [[WP:BRD]]. I made an edit by moving content from one section to another and thoroughly discussed it at talk. If you disagreed, you were free to revert or further discuss at Talk or any of a number of forums to discuss the subject edit. Instead, you think the right course of action is to jump to AE, which represents Battleground behavior in the extreme.--[[User:Jiujitsuguy|Jiujitsuguy]] ([[User talk:Jiujitsuguy#top|talk]]) 19:13, 14 May 2012 (UTC)
::::[[WP:BRD]] is not a policy, [[WP:CONSENSUS]] is. Furthermore, there was no &quot;Bold&quot; edit. A discussion on a proposal was opened and taking place. I made the last point on the issue, no one, including yourself, responded to it. Instead, you took it upon yourself to make the edit. If I thought the right course of action was A/E, then this talk would be happening over there, wouldn't it? In all honestly, you don't need to care about anything I say here. If you want to keep editing in a way that has historically led to very long topic-bans, you are free to do it. I don't really care. -[[User:Asad112|asad]] ([[User talk:Asad112|talk]]) 20:19, 14 May 2012 (UTC)

== Jenin ==

Hey, yeah, my bad. That source only intimated it was mostly civilians, so I thought I'd check it to get something definite. Just as well, since I found [http://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/02/israeloccupied-territories-jenin-war-crimes-investigation-needed another HRW source] that says &quot;Human Rights Watch identified fifty-two Palestinians who were killed during the operation, of whom twenty-two were civilians.&quot; I'll change the article now to reflect it. ~&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iloveandrea|Iloveandrea]] ([[User talk:Iloveandrea|talk]]) 21:53, 18 May 2012 (UTC)

== A question ==

Hi,  I've asked this a couple of times in the current discussion on the legality of settlements question but it has not received an answer.  Could you clarify what the current proposal is?  Some people are taking it as a proposal to revisit the question of consensus whilst other people are taking it as a proposal to overturn the consensus.  Unless there is some clarity on this point it is going to make it very hard to assess how to weigh comments on the topic as the two questions require different arguments to support them.

::How about you answer my question rather than throwing out veiled sock-puppet accusations?
