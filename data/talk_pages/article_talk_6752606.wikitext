==Untitled==
There is no mention of an actual date of when the structure was finished. I would assume mid to late 4th century, but the exact date (or accepted estimation) should be found. [[User:70.181.84.243|70.181.84.243]] 04:46, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

== Constantine reigned after his death? ==

''Construction began during the reign of Emperor Constantine I around 350 AD.''

According to the Wikipedia article on Constantine I, he died 337. [[Special:Contributions/69.42.3.105|69.42.3.105]] ([[User talk:69.42.3.105|talk]]) 00:52, 12 March 2011 (UTC)


==Architecture== 
There are two points made here, 1. that it is a domed structure with an ambulatory  2. that the centre part is light and the ambulatory dark Each of these two things is said at least three times. 

I ant to rewrite this section. [[User:Amandajm|Amandajm]] ([[User talk:Amandajm|talk]]) 09:18, 6 December 2013 (UTC)
