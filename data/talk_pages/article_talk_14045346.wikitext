Your continued violations of Wikipedia image copyright and fair-use policies are placing the Wikipedia in legal jeopardy.  These actions are taken ''very seriously''.  You have been blocked for 24 hours.  You are welcome to resume editing once the block expires but you must refrain from uploading any more images until you have fixed the substantial problems with every single image you have uploaded.

==Unspecified source for Image:Steph mcmahon.jpg==

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Steph mcmahon.jpg]]'''. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{tl|GFDL-self-no-disclaimers}} tag can be used to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Fair use]], use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use]]. See [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user={{PAGENAMEE}}}} this link]. '''Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If the image is copyrighted under a [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|non-free license]] (per [[Wikipedia:Fair use]]) then '''the image will be deleted [[WP:CSD#I7|48 hours]] after 17:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)'''.

You said: &quot;Hey, again, I e-mailed Jen, the owner of the imahe of Steph_mcmahon, she said it's fine to use the image. As long as its used fairly. So, does that count?&quot;

:So long as it is fine to use outside of the Wikipedia, so long as it may be used commercially, and so long as people are free to modify the image.  [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]] covers this in detail and explains how to forward your permission email to the appropriate people.  If you are doing so, please make a note on the image page because it can take the permissions list a while to respond.  --[[User:Yamla|Yamla]] 23:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== John Cena question ==
You asked: &quot;Hey, I have a question. Since your an administrator and stuff. I've met John Cena and have asked him what's his favorite baseball team and he responded by saying &quot;The Boston Red Sox&quot;. Now, I put that on his personal info. page and it got deleted, because some said I needed a &quot;reliable resource&quot;. So, I find his bio. on another website and stated there that his favorite baseball team is in fact the Boston Red Sox. Then I checked and it was gone because some said that wasn't reliable. So, where does that stand at?&quot;

:Hi.  Good question.  The policies in play here are [[WP:V]], [[WP:RS]], and [[WP:CITE]].  The key points are that the information must be verifiable and reliable.  So, when you ask Cena a question, that's not verifiable.  There's no way for me to double-check this.  I suppose I could ask him myself but he may have changed his mind, at which point there's no way for me to tell if you were lying or if Cena changed his mind.  So, what about a bio on another website?  Depends on whether or not this is reliable.  If they cite this information and state that Cena said this in a specific interview in a specific magazine, say, then this would probably be reliable.  If they just make the claim without saying where they got the information, though, then it's not reliable.  Many biographies (and, interestingly, very many bios on imdb) contain false information.  Check the policies I pointed you at above and let me know if you have any questions.  --[[User:Yamla|Yamla]] 23:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

You said: &quot;Hey, what about a fan site? Cause their reliable. Right?&quot;

:No, fansites are rarely reliable.  --[[User:Yamla|Yamla]] 23:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== Randy Orton ==
You asked: &quot;Hey, another question. I read an article, someone was interviewing Randy Orton and they asked him a lot of questions. And they asked him who was his best-friend in the WWE and he stated that it was John Cena. And again, I put that in his personal info. that Orton was in fact best-friends with Cena. And I put the internet source and again got DELETED. Another suggestion?&quot;

:Well, it could be that the person considered it not particularly notable.  Hard to say for sure in this case, though.  I personally looked at that edit initially, checked the reference, and thought it was reasonable to stay.  Now, if only everyone on the Wikipedia believed I was the ultimate authority on everything, we'd have none of these sorts of problems.  ;-)  --[[User:Yamla|Yamla]] 02:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

=== Adopted ===

{{Adoptee|Bloddyfriday}}

Tell me all you want to learn at my talk page and I will do the best I can.


===What I know===

First off I noticed you've been in trouble a lot, but not intentionatly.
If you haven't already apologized in the best way you can think of, you should.
You could tell the people that your sorry and prove it by joining some memberships on Wikipedia,
making good edits, Articles and stuff like that that will help the site. 
I would hate to see you banned. Sorry that it sounded like some boring lecture you would recieve at school. Now you have asked me to teach what I know, No matter if someone starts a fight on you or not don't fight back, try and solve it the best way you can and if it continues then go report them. Also if you don't agree with someone elses edit and the put it baack after you change it ask them why they think that edit belongs in the article and then tell them why you don't think it belongs in an article. Finally if there is a problem you can't solve and none of your friends or I can solve then seek help from an Admin. I'm sure you know all that, but I tried my best. If you can think of a more specific area that you need help with I might be able to be of more help. I'd like to apologize for sounding like a know it all above (or a complete idiot), that is just the best I could word it, hope I helped you some how.

===Creating new articles===

No, You don't have to be a pro to create new articles.
Though the one I've spent some time on ended up deleted, but hey if
it got deleted it deserved to be deleted. The way I see making new articles is 
it had better be a very spectacular article for it to not be deleted. [[User:Bloddyfriday|Bloddyfriday]] 00:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Simple permission to use the image on Wikipedia is not good enough.  Wikipedia is a [[free content]] encyclopedia, so any image needs to either be under a free-content license, or meet Wikipedia's [[WP:FU|rules for fair use]].  Also, make sure the person you're asking permission from is authorized to give that permission: generally only the copyright holder is able to release an image under a free license. --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 00:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

Hey, welcome to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films|Films WikiProject]]!  We're a group of editors working to improve Wikipedia's coverage of films and film characters.  If you haven't already, please add {{tl|User WikiProject Films}} to your user page.

A few features that you might find helpful:
* Most of our important discussions about the project itself and its related articles take place on the project's [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Films|main discussion page]]; it is highly recommended that you [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Films|action=watch}} watchlist it].

* The project has a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Outreach#Newsletter|monthly newsletter]].  The newsletter for January has been [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Outreach/January 2007 Newsletter|published]].  February's issue is ''currently in production''; it will be delivered as a link, but [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Outreach#Delivery options|several other formats]] are available.

There is a variety of interesting things to do within the project; you're free to participate however much—or little—you like:

* Want to jump right into editing?  The [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Style|style guidelines]] show things you should include.
* Want to assist in some current backlogs within the project? Visit the [[Template:WikiProject Films tasks|Film Tasks template]] to see how you can help.
* Want to know how good our articles are?  Our [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Assessment|assessment department]] has rated the quality of ''every'' film article in Wikipedia.  Check it out!
* Want to collaborate on articles?  The [[Wikipedia:Cinema Collaboration of the Week|Cinema Collaboration of the Week]] picks an article every week to work on together.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask [[:Category:WikiProject Films participants|another fellow member]], and we'll be happy to help you.  Again, welcome!  We look forward to seeing you around! [[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] 04:11, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

==About Page Archiving==

You do not need to be an admin to archive pages. [[WP:ARCHIVE]] describes some of the methods that can be used for you. In your case, I archived your talk page the same way I archive my page by moving the page to [[User talk:Zerorules677/Archive 1]], added the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{talkpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to the top and bottom, and then going back to your main talk page and editing that to remove the redirect and replace it with the archive box (which you can see as the first line on this page). I hope that helps out, and I'll be happy to answer any more questions you may have... just write to me on my talk page again. --[[User:Autocracy|&lt;span style=&quot;background:darkblue; color:white&quot;&gt;'''Auto'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Autocracy|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#B0C4DE; color:black&quot;&gt;''talk''&lt;/span&gt;]] / [[Special:Contributions/Autocracy|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#B0C4DE; color:black&quot;&gt;''contribs''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 01:42, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

The images only purpose is to display the SCM and the rest of the crowd around the kick itself is clutter.

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Ericson-alexander-molano.png]]'''. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, the image is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box.

== Image:Ericson-Molano.jpg ==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Ericson-Molano.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Fair use criteria|first fair use criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:Image:Ericson-Molano.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, '''without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:Ericson-Molano.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

But let's concentrate on the positives, hmmm? :) My friends got me a great cake, a lot like this one, and since you've been so kind, I saved you a piece. Hope you enjoy it, and the rest of your day :) [[User:Riana|Riana]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Riana|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 10:37, 21 June 2007 (UTC)
