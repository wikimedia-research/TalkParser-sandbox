==Sagebrush lizard v Southern sagebrush lizard==
This article is titled Southern sagebrush lizard, but is really an article about the three distinct varieties of sagebrush lizard (i.e. it also discusses the Northern and Western sagebrush lizard). Should this page therefore be moved to '''Sagebrush Lizard''', or should the irrelevant info be split into different pages. In other words, are the 3 different sagebrush lizards different enough to justify having distinct pages that will also be separate from the main sagebrush lizard page?  Anyone have an opinion, before I just have the info moved back to the Sagebrush lizard page???

== Amniota in the taxobox ==

Amniota is placed in the series taxon in the taxobox.

This is consistent with the Wikipedia article on [[tetrapoda]] and [[amniota]].  There are issues however:
# According to Wikipedia, the series taxon is a botanical subdivision of genus. I could not find any reference beyond the Wikipedia articles on tetrapoda and amniota for its use as a zoological taxon. [[Series_(botany)]]
# The Wikipedia taxobox places the series taxon at where the botanical series taxon is placed.  So placing the amniota taxon in the series taxon in the taxobox results in amniota being incorrectly located in the taxobox.
# Outside of Wikipedia I couldn't find precedent for the zoological taxon rank of series.  Is it possible that the Wikipedia articles on tetrapoda and amniota are just wrong on this point?
# As of the time that I am writing this the Wikipedia taxobox does not have a division between superclassis and classis. So it does not seem possible to correctly use amniota as a taxon name in a taxobox at the current time. [[Wikipedia:Taxobox_usage#All parameters]]

The amniota taxon appears to be a grouping of all the tetrapods excluding the amphibians.

My suggestion with regard to this is that amniota be removed from the sagebrush lizard taxobox, until and if the Wikipedia taxobox is modified to allow the proper use of amniota.[[User:Davefoc|Davefoc]] ([[User talk:Davefoc|talk]]) 19:59, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
