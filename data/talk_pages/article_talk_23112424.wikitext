I have it on good authority that the start/finish line is on the wrong straight - it should be on the one opposite towhere it is now. [[User:Prisonermonkeys|Prisonermonkeys]] ([[User talk:Prisonermonkeys|talk]]) 11:20, 16 November 2009 (UTC)


Buddh International Circuit in Noida in Noida has now been declared the second quickest track in the world after Monza (Italy)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/115.117.179.238|115.117.179.238]] ([[User talk:115.117.179.238|talk]]) 15:28, 22 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The word Budh can be rendered in English as Intelligence/Awareness/Enlightenement. Gautama the Holy Man of the Sankyas was given this title of &quot;Enlightened one&quot;. 
Peace and Tranquility would be rendered as Shanti.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.141.17.234|88.141.17.234]] ([[User talk:88.141.17.234|talk]]) 16:38, 1 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
