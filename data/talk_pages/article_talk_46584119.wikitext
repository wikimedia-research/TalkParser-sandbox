== Welcome! ==
Hello, SamanthaBlueButterfly, and '''[[Project:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]'''!&amp;#32;Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/SamanthaBlueButterfly|your contributions]].

I noticed that one of the first articles you edited was [[:Demongelic]], which appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a [[Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with close associations|conflict of interest]]. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a [[Wikipedia:Tutorial/Keep in mind#Neutral point of view|neutral]] and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article.&amp;#32;Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason.

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or another editor to proofread it. See [[Help:Userspace draft|our help page on userspace drafts]] for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators willing to provide copies of deleted articles|anyone from this list]] and they will [[Wikipedia:Userfication|copy it to your user page]].

One rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Sharing accounts|be blocked from editing]]. Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Promotional names|usernames which imply that the account belongs to a company or corporation]]. If you have a username like this, you should [[Wikipedia:Changing username|request a change of username]] or create a new account. (A name that identifies the user as an individual within a given organization may be OK.)

Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign]] your messages on [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]]s using four [[tilde]]s (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically insert your username and the date.  If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:C.Fred|my talk page]], or ask your question on this page and then place '''{{Tlc|Help me}}''' before the question. Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:Welcome-COI --&gt; â€”'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 23:35, 1 May 2015 (UTC)
