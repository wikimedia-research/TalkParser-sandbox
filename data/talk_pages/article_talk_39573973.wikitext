[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:My76Strat|My76Strat]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/62.242.40.71|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen?diff=558251180 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Hans Christian Andersen]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:My76Strat|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;--[[User:My76Strat|My76Strat]] ([[User talk:My76Strat|talk]]) 07:31, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
