:''If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''

We don't ban shared IP addresses. Your assertion that warnings have &quot;zero effect&quot; is simply that an assertion with no evidence to back it up. Wikipedia's policy is to warn vandals. Please stop your campaign of disruption and incivility. Thanks, [[User:Gwernol|Gwernol]] 12:07, 7 June 2008 (UTC)
