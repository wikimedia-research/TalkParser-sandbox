[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Hz.tiang|Hz.tiang]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/101.163.27.204|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Marian art in the Catholic Church]] because it didn't appear constructive. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Hz.tiang|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;  [[User:Hz.tiang|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;Hz.&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Hz.tiang|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;tiang&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:32, 9 March 2013 (UTC)
