{{Etymology section|class=missing}}

There was a vogue in the 1960s for advertisers to describe things as &quot;the thinking man's X,&quot; in an attempt to appeal to consumers who considered themselves high-brow (another 1960s term). I cannot think of any examples, sadly, but they would on the lines of &quot;Volvo: the Thinking Man's Car&quot; or &quot;Newsweek: The Thinking Man's newsmagazine.&quot; ~~RKH

The article cites an article that says that the term 'crumpet' in this context dates from the 1930s.  The Penguin Dictionary of Historical Slang pushes it back to around 1880.  However, that source adds that 'crumpet' was also used as a term of endearment from the same time.  The phrase 'thinking man's crumpet' is furthermore almost certainly also a play on the meaning crumpet = head.[[User:Athulin|Athulin]] ([[User talk:Athulin|talk]]) 10:13, 30 July 2011 (UTC)

Additionally, I suspect that there is somewhat of a 'rhyming slang' connection with the Victorian 'strumpet'....suitably Bowlderized for 'polite' company. Of the ladies identified in the article, Nigella Lawson has been identified in the past with 'food porn' in particular.
