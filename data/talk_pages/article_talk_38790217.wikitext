==Dates==
Please do not link individual years, per [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Date_formatting]] and [[WP:CONTEXT]]. The exception is if the year is from a different decade than the previous article, for example referencing something which happened in the previous or next decade. Then, the year should be piped to the appropriate article:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Guiding Light (1950-1959)|1952]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
