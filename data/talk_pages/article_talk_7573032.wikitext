== Removal of long list of cofounders and personal weblink ==

I've removed some additions by [[User:Daniel Eggink]] which were added with the edit summary &quot;cofounders whom I knew and workedf with.&quot;  I certainly don't want to discourage somebody with first-hand knowledge of the Oracle from contributing here, and I have no doubt that the names listed were really the folks who created the paper, but the fact that it's true isn't sufficient to add it to Wikipedia.  Personal knowledge is what Wikipedia calls &quot;original research,&quot; and it isn't permitted in the articles: for better or worse, the Wikipedia policy is to only include information that can be verified as having already been published in a &quot;reliable source.&quot;  See the policies [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:RS]].  Alas, Wikipedia does not share the wide-open ethos of the underground press.  [[User:BTfromLA|BTfromLA]] 02:13, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

: Throughout history, first-hand knowledge has been the source of much biographical material (e.g. Schiller on Beethoven) -- particularly in the cases of important personages unlauded by mainstream culture. Until such time as &quot;official biography&quot; is written, it is often the only source of personal history.&lt;br&gt;The Oracle was an important part of mid-20th century culture: its coming and going is underdocumented. This removal should have first been the subject of a discussion: I'm doubtful that first-hand reporting of hard-to-find details is part of the &quot;original research&quot; WP sought to ban. At least: thanks, Mr. Eggink, for leaving some clues. [[User:Twang|Twang]] 18:16, 10 October 2007 (UTC)
