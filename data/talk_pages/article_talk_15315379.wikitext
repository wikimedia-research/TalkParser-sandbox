=={{{header-text|Notability of [[:Tamarack (band)]]}}}==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt; A tag has been placed on [[:Tamarack (band)]] requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the [[WP:Your first article|guide to writing your first article]].

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Tamarack (band)|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  Blanchardb-&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User:Blanchardb|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808040&quot;&gt;Me&lt;/span&gt;]]•[[User Talk:Blanchardb|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#408080&quot;&gt;MyEars&lt;/span&gt;]]•[[Special:Contributions/Blanchardb|&lt;span style=&quot;color:804080&quot;&gt;MyMouth&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;-timed 19:31, 19 January 2008 (UTC)
