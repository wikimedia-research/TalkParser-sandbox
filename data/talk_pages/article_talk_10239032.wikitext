==&quot;Zabaykalsky&quot; vs. &quot;Trans(-)baikal(ia)&quot;==
Please do not move this article to a name that's a variation of &quot;Trans-baikal&quot;.  As the federal subject is very new, there is no established English name for it in English.  Per [[WP:RUS#Place names]], romanization must be used when a conventional English name does not exist.  Additionally, the krai is not the same as [[Transbaikal]] (which is a historic/geographic region), so the names are not interchangeable.—[[User:Ezhiki|Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ezhiki|yo?]]); 23:37, 2 March 2008 (UTC)
