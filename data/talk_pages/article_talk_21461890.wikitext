== Moved without the full stop ==

I moved St. James's Park to St James's park (without the full stop) because according to the official website, it doesn't have a full stop. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Parable1991|Parable1991]] ([[User talk:Parable1991|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Parable1991|contribs]]) 01:21, 31 March 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

: I'm afraid that I've moved this back.
: There was a discussion about this a while ago (2004?), and the &quot;full stop&quot; is indeed part of the name. I've got a few 'photos of the park's signage to prove it if you really want. :-)
: A web-site is a very poor guide for what is &quot;correct&quot;, as they're normally done by web designers rather than people familiar with the topic.
: For comparison, St. James's Park tube station is also with the dot.

==I f'd up==
I didn't mean to undo the move, sorry. It should be at [[St James's Park]], I was looking at the incoming redirects from a different page. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 11:40, 9 February 2009 (UTC)
