Its not a university,It's a house of knowledge and It's a holy place too

== dont mis use the privilege and mis guide people on the internet... ==

there are more ways to rant about your feelings than spoiling the reputation of the entire University on the World Wide Web just because you can get away with it by being anonymous... 

the previous edit was one such kind... 

grow up man... whoever did that...

regards...

== &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; ==
Don't get me wrong here. Articles about a business are supposed to be written by people who know about the business, not by people who run the business. And there's something called the [[WP:COPY]] policy which says that content in a copyrighted website cannot be copied into Wikipedia. So there's no right reason for all the stuff that's on the article right now to be there. So someone please write something sensible or revert it to previous versions.

And is there any need for all those &quot;External links to that crappy site??????--[[User:Karunyan|Karunyan]] ([[User talk:Karunyan|talk]]) 09:31, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

=='''GUESS U DO NOT ANYTHING BOUT KARUNYA UNIVERSITY'''==
dis is in reply to whoever wrote bout dis university bein hopeless and stuff...
let me tel u...i've been a student of dis great university nd i've spent four years there...its like my second home nd i've been part of everythin that happened there...i hav been personally benefitted a lot from dis university...it has '''changed my life '''greatly...

nd bout the founder...'''how dare u ''' compare him with bin laden?!?!?!...wonder how u can find any similarity between these two!!!...bin laden's been killing thousands nd destroyin people's lives...whereas our founder has saved thousands of lives by givin them the '''message of hope'''...he has dedicated his entire life to help millions of people like you, who do not know where they r heading, to find the true meaning of life...

whoever wrote dat seems hopeless...but thrs hope for u if only u '''repent''' of it nd ask forgiveness to God...instead of spreading false stuff like dis nd misleading people, live a life with '''purpose nd meaning'''...
