==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Cas Anvar]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Cas Anvar]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Cas Anvar|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Cas Anvar|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Zachlipton|Zachlipton]] ([[User talk:Zachlipton|talk]]) 07:25, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

== January 2011 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved, instead of writing it yourself, as you did at [[:Cas Anvar]]. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. 

Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|article about yourself]] is ''strongly'' discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on [[wikipedia:articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not ''start'' articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to [[Wikipedia:No original research]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. 

If you are not [[WP:notability|&quot;notable&quot;]] under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_social_networking.2C_or_memorial_site|Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider]] and would thus qualify for [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#a7|speedy deletion]].  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. (See [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles]].)  Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Zachlipton|Zachlipton]] ([[User talk:Zachlipton|talk]]) 07:25, 8 January 2011 (UTC)
