&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''[[WP:Block|blocked]] indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended for publicity and/or promotional purposes. If you intend to edit constructively in other topic areas, you ''may'' be granted the right to continue under a change of username. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; margin-top:15px&quot;&gt;
;Why can't I edit Wikipedia?
[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or [[Special:MyPage|username]] indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, website or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[WP:LINKSPAM|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:Spam|posting advertisements]] and [[WP:PROMOTION|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on [[:Category:Companies|companies]], groups, and [[:Category:Organizations|organizations]], but such groups are generally discouraged from using Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[WP:ORGNAME|username policy]].
&lt;/div&gt;

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not, although if you can demonstrate a pattern of future editing in strict accordance with our [[Wikipedia:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy, you ''may'' be granted this right.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organizations|Wikipedia's FAQ for Organizations]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, organization, or clients. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit Wikipedia again.

;What can I do now?

If you have no interest in writing about some other topic than your organization, group, company, or product, you may consider using [[WP:Alternative outlets|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead. 
 
If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions here about some other topic, you must convince a [[WP:ADMIN|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include &quot;tlx or the first | character&quot;. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[WP:U|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
**Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
**Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|Your reason here}} below, but you should read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first. &lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z17}}&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt;  [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 02:31, 29 September 2013 (UTC)
