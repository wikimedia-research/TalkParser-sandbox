[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''Welcome to Wikipedia.''' Everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia. However, the [[WP:ORGNAME|username]] you have chosen ''(Victorian (cigarette))'' seems to imply that you are editing on behalf of a group, company or website.

&lt;u&gt;There are two issues with this&lt;/u&gt;:
# '''It is possible that you have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]].''' In keeping with Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy, you must exercise great caution when editing on topics related to your organization.
# '''Your account [[WP:NOSHARE|cannot represent a group of people]].''' You may wish to [[Special:Userlogin/signup|create a new account]] with a username that represents only you. Alternatively, you may consider [[WP:CHU|changing your username]] to avoid giving the impression that your personal account is being used for [[WP:Spam|promotional purposes]].

Regardless of whether you change your name or create a new account, '''''you are not exempted''''' from the guideline to avoid editing where you have a conflict of interest. For information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].&lt;!-- Template:uw-coi-username --&gt; Thank you.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:User:Victorian (cigarette)]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:User:Victorian (cigarette)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:User:Victorian (cigarette)|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[User talk:Victorian (cigarette)|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; ''[[User:Bonadea|bonadea]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Bonadea|contributions]] [[User talk:Bonadea|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:51, 28 November 2010 (UTC)

{{unblock reviewed|1=I humbly apologize for the many breach of wikipedia guideline, due to inexperience and this is my 1st time using wikipedia, I was operating on a trial and error basis.

I see no damage in creating this article as I see there are topic such as [[Dunhill (cigarette)]],[[Electronic cigarette]] that is deem relevant to wikipedia.

Here are a few key questions:
* Do you understand that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY|not a business directory]]?
* Do you understand [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]?
* Do you understand that to be considered for an encylopedia article, the subject must be [[WP:GNG|considered to be notable]]?

You are currently blocked because your username appears directly related to a company, group or product that you have been [[WP:NOTADVERTISING|promoting]], contrary to [[WP:ORGNAME|the username policy]]. Changing the username will not allow you to violate the 3 important principles above.&lt;!-- Template:coiq --&gt; '''[[User:Ronhjones|&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;color:black; padding:1px;background:yellow&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ron&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;h&lt;/font&gt;jones&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]'''&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ronhjones|&amp;nbsp;(Talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:27, 5 December 2010 (UTC)
