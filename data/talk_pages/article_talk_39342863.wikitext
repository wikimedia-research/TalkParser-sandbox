The Sagenista illustration is wrong, it shows a Chrysophyte coloutless algae of the genus Paraphysomonas. They are scales and not reproductive bodies. The 'nucleus' is actually the cell body. This picture should be removed.
Also, putting (Photosynthetic) below Ochrophyta (int he table) is misleading since Photosynthesis has been lost in several groups - having a photosynthetic ancestor doesn't necessarily make something a photosynthetic organism.--[[User:Paraphyso|Paraphyso]] ([[User talk:Paraphyso|talk]]) 08:59, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
