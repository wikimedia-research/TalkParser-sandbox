== Article move ==

This article was just moved from the Long Beach Press-Telegram to Press-Telegram (Long Beach) with no discussion.  The parent company, the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, refers to the newspaper as the Long Beach Press-Telegram [http://www.langnews.com/About/newspapers.shtml# here], as does the [http://www.presstelegram.com/copyright legal section of the web site].  Is there another reference to indicate that it does not go by the Long Beach Press-Telegram anymore? [[User:Alanraywiki|Alanraywiki]] ([[User talk:Alanraywiki|talk]]) 04:17, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

The PT's flag is the ''Press-Telegram'', not the ''Long Beach Press-Telegram''. The LANG website uses this method to refer to papers that don't have a city name in the flag (example: the Torrance ''Daily Breeze'').
