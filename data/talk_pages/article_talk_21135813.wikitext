== African-American ==

Is Carter African-American? I do not know. I read the article in the sources about his being made a coach at Purdue and it had nothing to say about Carter's ethnicity. All I know is that until somewhere in the text says that Carter is African-American, we should not categorize him as such.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 01:37, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
*This was five second verifiable, [http://caafootball.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/celebrating-black-history-towsons-rubin-carter/ photo and text]. Removing easily verifiable information does not make this article better. It takes less time to verify in sources than to complain of the lack of citation. __[[User:Elaqueate|Elaqueate]] ([[User talk:Elaqueate|talk]]) 07:43, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
