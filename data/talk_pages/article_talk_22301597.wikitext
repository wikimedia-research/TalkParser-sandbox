==Speedy deletion of [[:Richard is cooler than amy]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] Thank you for experimenting with Wikipedia. As the [[Wikipedia:Namespace#Main|article namespace]] is for encyclopedic content and not tests, the page you made will soon be deleted. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Richard is cooler than amy|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Richard is cooler than amy|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-test-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:DFS454|DFS454]] ([[User talk:DFS454|talk]]) 09:52, 6 April 2009 (UTC)
