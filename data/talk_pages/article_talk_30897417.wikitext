==Request move==
&lt;del&gt;
[[NRL All Stars Squad]] → {{no redirect|1=NRL All Stars}} — Article is not about the squad but the whole team. Move will bring it into line with other articles. [[User:Mattlore|Mattlore]] ([[User talk:Mattlore|talk]]) 06:28, 16 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/del&gt;
*'''Withdrawn''' as I have moved the page to NRL All Stars rugby league team which I feel to be an even better, if longer, name. [[User:Mattlore|Mattlore]] ([[User talk:Mattlore|talk]]) 22:31, 16 February 2011 (UTC)
