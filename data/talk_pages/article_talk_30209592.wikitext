== Introduction ==

Article states that the introduction is a &quot;close 4 part harmony&quot;. I have all 24 of the master tracks from this song, and whilst the intro does start off with 4 harmony voices, its later branches off to at least 5. It's difficult to hear, so I may be mistaken.
What I guess I'm trying to say is where is the source for the &quot;4 part harmony&quot; information? [[Special:Contributions/114.77.25.218|114.77.25.218]] ([[User talk:114.77.25.218|talk]]) 07:55, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Wessex ==

According to http://www.queenconcerts.com/london.html#wessex
Wessex Studios was never used to record Bohemian Rhapsody.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/142.1.161.121|142.1.161.121]] ([[User talk:142.1.161.121|talk]]) 16:34, 10 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:This raises a problem with reliable sources. ''Sound On Sound'' is considered a reliable publication. How does the website to which you link a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]? Who is the author? What are their credentials (affiliation with the group or professional journalist)? What is the source of their assertion that the studio was not used for ''BR''? Going by the standard of the website, its author may very well be correct, and it is far from unreasonable to think that a professional journalist in a professional magazine can be inaccurate. However, Wikipedia must consider the reliability of sources.

== Objective: FA ==

I'd like to try and get this article to FA standard, and have been doing a lot of work on it in the past few days, following a request for a peer review I put in about a week ago. The comments we received I have pasted below, and as I complete tasks I will strike through the relevant sections. Anyone wishing to help out should do the same.

*The lead should include &lt;s&gt;mention of the songs prominence in &quot;Wayne's World&quot; as well as&lt;/s&gt; discussion of live performances of the song. These are subjects in the article not explored in the lead. An article of this length could easily have a three paragraph lead.
*The lead also has a lot of phrases like, &quot;it is considered...&quot;  Take care when using terms like this, they can be construed as [[WP:Weasel|weasel wording]].  I know it's in the lead and there are licenses you can take in the lead, but I still would watch the use of terms like that.
*You should probably look for a couple more images, it may be difficult to find free use images for a song but if it's possible it would be good to add a couple more. &lt;s&gt;Also be sure to add [[WP:ALT|ALT text]] to the images that you have and that you add.&lt;/s&gt;
*You have several short paragraphs. Consider combining or expanding these to make the reading easier.  
*You need consistency in your referencing format.  See [[WP:CITE]] for various formats.  All website refs should have title of the article, url, publisher and accessdate as a minimum. You can use the {{tl|cite web}} template as a guide.
*Make sure your references are credible and that you are ready to defend refs that the FAC reviewers question. Some of the refs I would question are: &lt;s&gt;ChC media&lt;/s&gt;, Sound on Sound, Record Collector, expressandstar.com.  These are sources I'm not familiar with (that's not to say they aren't credible I just don't recognize them).
*You're going to need to get more references, especially book references (6 books in the &quot;General&quot; section)  Are all those books actually referenced in the article with in-line cites?  If not you should otherwise the books should go under a &quot;Further Reading&quot; section.  A song of this magnitude with the level of exposure and impact it has had on the music industry should have been written about in several books.  Check google books for a start.  Book references are more credible and looked on more favorably at [[WP:FAC|FAC]] than website refs. &lt;s&gt;I see you have a section entitled &quot;General&quot; in the references section, I'm assuming that is for the books, and then &quot;Specific is for websites and page numbers of the books used.  I've never seen this format before.  Be sure it follows one of the [[MOS]]-accepted referencing formats.&lt;/s&gt;

'''Other Notes:'''
*When working on an article for FA I like to look at current FAs on the same subject to compare my article to.  For this article I've chosen [[4 Minutes (Madonna song)]] as an example for no particular reason other than that it is a popular song FA.  Try to include all the subjects found in this article if possible.  Note the Track listings and formats section as well as chart, sales and procession section.  This would be good content to add to your article.  The article also has 63 references, double what Bohemian Rhapsody has.  Note there are no book references so you can have an FA with no book references but keep in mind that this article is about a fairly recent song (2 years old), with no where near the fame of Bohemian Rhapsody.  Bohemian Rhapsody has been around for over 30 years.  To see an FA for an older song look at [[Hey Jude]].  It's shorter than the Madonna song without some of the chart and track sections.  It also has about 15 books referenced.  I don't necessarily like the way the auther splits the Notes and References section like that but you'll find there are a plethora of ways to cite references in wikipedia.  The important thing is to pick a format and be consistent.

== Any way vs. Anyway ==

The article states the grammatically correct &quot;Any way the wind blows&quot; however the sleeve of ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' denotes it as &quot;Anyway&quot; instead. Which one should be used for the article and why? [[User:TheStig118|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#F23838&quot;&gt;'''''TheStig'''''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;'''''[[User_talk:TheStig118|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#2E308C&quot;&gt;t&lt;/font&gt;]]·[[Special:Contributions/TheStig118|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#2E308C&quot;&gt;c&lt;/font&gt;]]'''''&lt;/sub&gt; 09:33, 25 April 2010 (UTC)
:Both versions of the song in my collection of sheet music (ISBN 0571527248 and ISBN 073999436365) use the &quot;Any way the wind blows&quot;. (I have another three as PDFs, without ISBN, so can't be used for verifiability.) The subtitle to the Queen + Paul Rogers DVD ''Live in the Ukraine'' also uses this version. Perhaps a footnote could be used to indicate the discrepancy should anyone care? [[User:The JPS|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;The &lt;b&gt;JP&lt;/b&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:The JPS|'''&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt; to me&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:46, 25 April 2010 (UTC)
:First of all, we can probably all agree that this is a teeny, tiny topic to worry about. I feel a bit silly discussing it (or, Jimbo help me, ''arguing'' about it), and I won't revert it again no matter which way it gets changed (unless, of course, we get avid discussion here and we reach a strong consensus for one way, and some IP later changes it to the other).
:Also, it's probably certain that Mercury ''meant'' &quot;any way the wind blows&quot;, and only that sense; I don't seriously argue that he meant &quot;anyway, the wind blows&quot; (in the rough sense of &quot;anyway, life sucks&quot;, or &quot;so what, the world keeps turning&quot;), although I do accept that as a possiblity.
:Unless he was going for deliberate amiguity, I thing the line as printed in the original LP sleeve is just erroneous; it's missing either the space inside &quot;anyway&quot; or the comma which should follow it. If subsequent editions from the record label or music publishers have it as &quot;any way&quot;, then I'd say we can proceed using that, without even requiring a footnote or mention. Does anyone (or any one of you) have a CD or newer release of ''A Night at the Opera'' where &quot;any way&quot; is used? The JPS, is that DVD you mentioned from Elektra/Warner?
:I think my main point is only: just because some transcriber at a sheet music or karaoke or DVD company (or Peraino, apparently) made a change based on his/her educated knowledge of English, we shouldn't repeat the act here ([[WP:OR]], [[WP:V]], and all that, even on a teeny weeny scale).
:Maybe instead of a footnote we could use ''sic'', as in
::The final line, &quot;Anyway [''sic!''] the wind blows&quot;, is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.
:or ''maybe'' better, using the {{tl|sic}} template,
::The final line, &quot;{{sic|Anyway}} the wind blows&quot;, is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.
:I believe I'd most prefer that last option, because we'd use the (at least originally) correct (although gramatically incorrect) text from the Real Source, while noting the (universally?) recognized intention of the writer/singer. The {{tl|sic}} template is supposed to discourage well-intentioned edits &quot;correcting&quot; what is obviously incorrect. We can then concentrate on more important areas.
:I'm watching this discussion but I believe I'm done arguing. Carry on, carry on... &lt;i&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:JohnFromPinckney|JohnFromPinckney]] ([[User talk:JohnFromPinckney|talk]])&lt;/i&gt; 11:53, 25 April 2010 (UTC)
::Ah, we're ''discussing'', not arguing :) The DVD is [[Live in Ukraine]]. I'm unsure about the sic, as that might be considered OR by asserting what Mercury's intention may have been. Just because we agree on what is most likely, we're still breaching [[WP:NOR]]. I'll defend the ''We Will Rock You'' score because of May's intense involvement in the production and its score. I'm, reluctantly, happy with the one-word version because of its use on the original album sleeve, but perhaps with a footnote addressing why we are using this option, whilst highlighting various other reliable sources use &quot;any way&quot;. This seems to be more objective?

:::Due to the modified lyrics and vastly modified tone of voice, as well as the exclusion of a large bulk of content in the song (most of the ballad section was cut out for the Muppets version), I regard it as more of a parody rather than an actual cover version.

Not just that, but I would not support a merge of an article that is so poorly written and structured in to this Good Article, one that is quickly approaching FA status.

== Cover Versions ==

I know the muppets is mentioned, but Glee is covering this in the season 1 finale, which airs Tuesday, it's already been released for online listening, as well as on itunes. Should this be mentioned somewhere in the article?

:: 'Mentioned' And 'Covered' are two entirely different things. They recorded a studio quality version of said song. You cannot really source a TV Show episode, however, gleethemusic has it on there, and it will also be released on Glee the Music: Journey to Regionals. If things are this strict with Bohemian Rhapsody, then there should be crackdown on every other song on Wikipedia. I understand Queen fans are 'protective' of this song, however, a very popular TV show is covering this song, releasing it as a single, airing it on TV, and releasing it in an album. That alone should be plenty mentionable. All can be sourced via the same sources on [[Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals]], and more sources can be found on the [[Journey (Glee)]] page. Everything else is like the entire muppets thing. It's something video, and cannot be sourced.

:::Re: &quot;If things are this strict with Bohemian Rhapsody, then there should be crackdown on every other song on Wikipedia.&quot; ...

I disagree strongly with moving the Muppets articles as the starting point for this list; inclusion via seealso linkage, yes, but not complete inclusion.  In part, I spent time yesterday establishing the notability of the song by itself, so the issues in the above section were addressed. Another part: the Muppets thing ''happened'' to become a single cover, but only started as the viral video, so it really doesn't fit there in its entirity.  Secondly, which i hadn't gotten around to, I beilieve that it is likely better to expand the Muppets version to includion nearly all of the other Muppets online endevours instead of just the BR video, as each of them gain notability on their own.  Because the section is about the video more than the actual single, that would be a better place for expansion. --[[User:Masem|M&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;ASEM&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 13:49, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

At the begining, the version of the Muppets was not more then a cover. Later it was released as a (download) single of Queen + The Muppets (for example on amazon and itunes). This gave it later legally a sort of collaboration and not just a cover version. And this is now my own oppinion: if the by Queen fans less liked collaboration of Queen with Five is mentioned in the [[We_Will_Rock_You#Five_.2B_Queen_Version|WWRY]] article, I think the collaboration of Queen with The Muppets can also be mentioned in the BR article. But I also think, that this article should be based on the original 1975 release and therefore further information about the collaboration should be posted on the cover topic. What do you think?
Conclusion: mention muppet version as a collaboration, further information should be left in the topic about BR covers. mo merge of the articles!!! --[[User:Schmeed|Schmeed]] ([[User talk:Schmeed|talk]]) 11:49, 16 November 2010 (UTC)


== Meaning of song's lyrics ==

I was curious about this explanation:

&quot;It has been said in time that the song was Freddie's way of subliminally telling his fans about his AIDS. If you listen to the lyrics, it makes sense that it would be about his AIDS and how he's ruined his life and doesn't want to die...&quot;

How could a song written in 1975 be about AIDS?  This was well before HIV disease was clinically identified, and over a decade before Mercury was diagnosed as being HIV positive.  Do you mean this was his was of telling fans he was *gay*?  The two things are quite different.

published sources. But I'm afraid to have to say, although I've never published anything, this author's quote, presuming it 

was not transcribed incorrectly, is incorrect, despite having been published -- Books in general do have editors, but I doubt 

many books about music have properly trained ''musical editors.''

If someone has access to the book &quot;Queering the Popular Pitch&quot; and can flip to page 252 to verify if the quote is 

mistranscribed, that would be great.

For reference, the citation for the quote specifies page 252 of Whiteley, Sheila (2006). Queering the Popular Pitch. 

Routledge. ISBN 0-415-97805-X.


---THE PART OF THIS POST THAT ADDRESSES THE POINT---

Below is the original segment from the quote that I (as a learned musician) disagree with.:

-----
heightened by the harmonic change from B♭ (6) to C7 in bars 1 and 2;
-----

This makes little musical sense as I can see (save for 'C7' if she's referring to the chord and not the (unsung) note C7 

(3 octaves above middle C, yikes).

Although the first (topmost) sung note IS a B♭, the actual first chord is 4-note (D4 F4 G4 B♭4) Gm7 2nd inversion, followed by a correctly quoted C7. (Not to mention, if she was referring to B♭ as the first note OR chord, either way, the 6 makes no sense, as the note is in the 4th octave, and is not a B♭6(3) (1st inversion) nor a B♭6(4) (2nd inv.) chord, but rather in actuality is that latter (2nd) inversion of Gm7. This is also not to mention that switching from referring initially to a note sung in the 'harmony' to a chord without any notice is vague and potentially misleading.)

So as you can see, this makes very little to no sense. I had been carefully studying the song during the half-hour or so before I brought up the Wikipedia page and noticed the error.

Since it's a quote from a book (that is if it's not a transcription typo), I don't at all imagine we can nor should change her words, 

I don't know what Wikipedia generally does in a situation like this, but I thought I'd let you guys know.

Perhaps the quote could be truncated of that specific part, or the quote replaced with a better one, or taken out altogether.

I'll leave that decision up to the Wikipedia community.

HERE DOWN = SKIPPABLE / EXTRANEOUS

(unless you feel kind enough to skip to the P.S. in the name of helping out a Wikipedia newb with a signature leaving problem...)

The only way I can imagine this quote making any semblance of sense, out of context, if in the context it was understood that the &quot;(6)&quot; referred to the amount of notes sung, and 'harmonic' was somehow established to refer initially to a note, and then a chord without any specific mention. This concept is hard to swallow, and is regardless misleading at the very least, and I don't necessarily imagine it is the sense in which the author meant it; I think either she was just wrong, mistyped, or the quote was mistranscribed.

I.E. &quot;heightened by the [topmost vocal] harmonic change from B♭ [with] (6) [of them sung] to [the chord] C7 in bars 1 and 2;&quot;

===Unrelated: Help with signature===

P.S. - Can someone tell me why it's kind of signing my post when I use the four tildes, but not as a link, and then minutes later adds &quot;previously unsigned comment added by&quot; my nickname and talk links in the proper linked format? It's confusing the heck out of me; Sorry, I'm a bit of a newb. I did read through the help though. And here I go, signing with four tilde's below:

EDIT: Well, it's still adding the preceding comment thing (after a while) it seems.
At the time I'm typing this, 'Tehmikuji' and 'talk' do not appear as links (not the initial ones before the &quot;Preceding unsigned comment added by&quot; thing. The help page [[Wikipedia:How_to_fix_your_signature]] did not help me.

In my preferences, I currently have (without the quotation marks) &quot;Tehmikuji (talk)&quot; typed into the field, and the &quot;Treat the above as Wiki Markup&quot; box checked.
I realize this isn't the place to ask about this, but.. I hope you'll have a little patience with a newbie, and at the very least simply ignore this without letting the FAIL of it get to you.

:Hi, Tehmikuji. I believe that SineBot expects links in your signature and, as you've noticed, yours doesn't have any links. SineBot can't know that you've signed, then, so it does it for you. The reason you've got no links is that you've (1) overridden the default signature in your Preferences and (2) specified that no link should appear (just your name and the word (talk)).

:The easiest thing to do, considering the form of signature you want, is to clear the Signature field and clear the checkbox, &quot;Treat the above as wiki markup.&quot; Click Save, and you should have the same sig you showed above. If you want anything fancier, you can read on...

:If you look at what SineBot creates (use the edit window), you might see the (heh) missing link. It's in the square brackets. The link target is what comes before the &quot;pipe&quot; symbol inside the brackets.

:Try this: In your Preferences, set the sig to be: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Tehmikuji|Tehmikuji]] ([[User talk:Tehmikuji|talk]])&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:That should give you a link to your User page first, followed, in parentheses, by a link to your Talk page. (This is actually the default form, so the simpler way I mentioned earlier is...simpler.) When you use &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; this bit will be inserted followed by the date and time. Good luck. For more help, use [[User talk:Tehmikuji|your Talk]] page (or mine). 

:I can't help with the musical bit above, as I (1) have no idea about, you know, ''notes'' and stuff; and (2) can't make out what your words have to do with the article.

== About the SOS '95 Article ==

I read last year's discussion comparing the SOS article and QueenConcerts in terms of authenticity. Now, I won't talk about QueenConcerts at the moment, just focus on SOS. I'm not denying that:

* It's a respectable publication.
* Roy Baker, unlike most (or all) of us, was there.
* The article is serious, detailed and mostly accurate.

However, keep in mind that:

* Even the best publications can make mistakes.
* A person's memory is not perfect. Roy Baker may have easily misremembered after two decades.
* There ''are'' other sources, which contradict some of the info.

Wessex Studios were, indeed, NOT used for this album. They were used for 'Sheer Heart Attack' (1974), also co-produced by Roy Baker, which is probably why he may have misremembered; another bit of trivia: both Wessex (up until summer '74, that is) and Lansdowne (which ''were'' used for 'A Night at the Opera' and, according to the current owner of the flat where they were located, used for parts of 'Bohemian Rhapsody') were both owned by George Martin, adding to the possibility that memory can easily mix-up the two of them (you can read the Wikipedia article on memory).

This is NOT having SOS vs Queen Concerts, but having a 20-year old recollection against:

* The album's liner notes (which were written mere ''days'', not ''decades'', after the recording sessions), which list the studios used for the album (i.e. Roundhouse, Scorpio, Lansdowne, Olympic, Rockfield and Sarm, ''not'' Wessex).

* The album's corrected liner notes on the 30th anniversary edition (which add Trident because of the National Anthem being recorded there on 27th October 1974, but again does ''not'' include Wessex).

* The fact Wessex Studios were, at that time, undergoing refurbishing, as they'd changed ownership and management. New recording rooms were built, a new piano was bought, maintenance engineers were hired (source: an interview with Timothy Freese-Greene on his website)... so, at the time, even if they'd wanted to record at Wessex, they wouldn't have been able to.

Being sensible, what's more likely? That album liner notes and even the history of the studios were wrong, or that a 20-year old recollection from a producer was wrong?

Same for the typo (which could've been the magazine's editor's mistake, rather than Baker's) on Scorpio Studio. They were indeed Scorpio, not Scorpion. Sources? Album liner notes, Marc Bolan's biography (T-Rex also recorded there), Supertramp's liner notes (they also recorded there), Ken Scott's recollection (http://www.gearslutz.com/board/q-producer-engineer-ken-scott/562010-scorpio-sound-studios.html), a Billboard ad celebrating their sixth year (http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8yMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT48&amp;dq=%22scorpio+sound%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38qGTeztGOeT0QH0grnDCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22scorpio%20sound%22&amp;f=false). All of that vs. a single publication based on an interview made two decades ''after'' the fact and already including another typo (the band rehearsed in Hertfordshire, not Herefordshire).

Due to the aforementioned reasons, if it's OK with the Wikipedia community, I'll take the liberty of removing Wessex from the list of studios used and correct the spelling on Scorpio. There are things we will probably never know for sure, but whether Wessex were used for this is not one of them; same for the name of Scorpio Sound Studio.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Seb1925|Seb1925]] ([[User talk:Seb1925|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Seb1925|contribs]]) 03:54, 21 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== History and Recording - Drum Click ==

According to several official sources, there was ''no'' drum click or metronome of any sort. Freddie Mercury conducted them and instructed them on the pauses (sources: John Deacon on the Magic Years documentary, Freddie Mercury on one of his filmed Munich interviews, Roger Taylor on Rhythm Magazine 2002, Brian May on the Inside the Rhapsody documentary). The multi-track also lacks said click track, both on its contents (available via the mentioned documentary, also played with on the 2004 BBC special programme about the song) and its tracksheet (visible on the aforementioned BBC documentary).

In fact, the piano tracks, if volume's turned considerably up during the silences, you can hear Mercury counting before the 'no no no no no no no' bit, while he's playing with Deacon and Taylor on the backing track. Again, it proves there was no drum click. This is not original research, but having ''several'' sources pointing at having ''no'' click track at all for this song.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Seb1925|Seb1925]] ([[User talk:Seb1925|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Seb1925|contribs]]) 04:03, 21 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Regarding my recent change (removed Sheilah Whiteley quote from Intro section) ==

This is why I am against the &quot;no original research&quot; rule as being an absolute rule regarding all things.

The truth of the matter is that someone with a good enough ear can hear exactly what's going on in a piece of music. To someone without a musical ear, it might seem that multiple notes at the same time &quot;cover each other up,&quot; much in the same way putting a wall between someone and a TV screen would prevent them from seeing the TV, but this is simply not true. They layer, and there are no secrets, nothing is hidden. Everything is self-evident fact to a good enough musician (with regard to harmony and such).

&quot;Scholar&quot; Sheilah Whitely was quoted as saying something like &quot;... harmonic change from B-flat (6) to C7 in bars 1 and 2,&quot; and this makes no musical sense, no matter what way you look at it.

If we are talking about harmony, the harmony/chords change from [the 2nd inversion of] a G minor 7 chord to C [dominant] 7, in bars 1 and 2.  Is it printed in a book or article somewhere?  Not that I specifically know of, but it is, I assure you with 100% confidence, a fact.

If you guys wanna add the Sheilah Whitely quote back, I would be happy if someone else has the time to check out the book and compare it with any number of previous versions of the article (before ~5:20pm PDT (GMT -7), April 26, 2011), and, if it was misquoted, then perhaps we can add it back, that is if the real text is correct of course.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Tehmikuji|Tehmikuji]] ([[User talk:Tehmikuji|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tehmikuji|contribs]]) 00:35, 27 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Meaning of the Song ==

Who agrees with me that this sentence might make it seem as if there is more speculation about this song's meaning than there actually is: &quot;Despite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics.&quot; I think that pretty much everybody agrees it's about a young man who confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is being executed. There are 7 billion people in the world and this song is extremely well-known, so it's no surprise that there's one music scholar, Sheila Whiteley, who has her own theory. But these are exceptions. Maybe we can add the word &quot;some&quot;? &quot;Despite this, ''some'' critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics.&quot; --[[Special:Contributions/82.171.13.139|82.171.13.139]] ([[User talk:82.171.13.139|talk]]) 12:37, 31 December 2011 (UTC)
== from 7 minutes to 5:55 ? ==

Book source : John Tobler and Stuart Grundy, ''The Record Producers'', BBC, 1982, ISBN 0 563 17958 9.

In the chapter regarding Roy Thomas Baker, the producer himself says, by '''three times''' on page 216, that the original recorded version lasted '''7 minutes''', also stating (back in 1981-82) that this ''long'' version got ''unexpected'' airplay by Kenny Everett on his Capitol Radio Saturday and Sunday programme, being entirely played fourteen times over the weekend. This second point is confirmed in the Release section of the feature (sourced by a subsequent book), but the 7 minute duration is never quoted.
  
Provided that we grant those 1981-82 RTB's sayings with some credibility, would s’dy know : 

1. If this ''long'' version has surfaced somewhere on a record ?

2. How the final single version was shortened by at least one minute ?

I have no idea why people (including Roy Thomas Baker, of all people) think it's so long.

== Movie use BEFORE Wayne's World ==

As mentioned in the article, Bohemian Rhapsody got a lot of attention from its inclusion in the 1992 movie &quot;Wayne's World.&quot; Yet, in this article, and in a Wikipedia article on Vic Tayback, there is NO mention of the use of this song in the 1989 movie &quot;Loverboy.&quot;  The &quot;Wayne's World&quot; scene with Bohemian Rhapsody WAS ALMOST AN EXACT COPY of the SAME SCENE from &quot;Loverboy.&quot;  In both scenes, a group of men were in a car when the song came on the radio and the men started bopping their heads during the guitar solo in the song.  In &quot;Loverboy,&quot; the Queen song was playing as the men were on their way to confront the pizza delivery boy (Patrick Demsey) (whose mother was played by Kate Jackson) who had become the town's male prostitute and had been with the wives of those men (one of whom was played by Vic Tayback).  When I first saw 
&quot;Wayne's World,&quot; I considered that the scene was an homage to the &quot;Loverboy&quot; scene. But since I've never seen an acknowledgement of this, it appears to be a rip off.

== Bohemian Rhapsody: Progressive rock ==

Why do you keep the genre of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;as &quot;Rock&quot;, as Rock is a very diverse genre of music, that is used to describe music by 1950's artists like Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly, to Cliff Richard, to the Beach Boys, to The Beatles, Rolling Stones and The Who, to The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Velvet Underground, to David Bowie, T. Rex, Sweet, Gary Glitter, Electric Light Orchestra, Pink Floyd, Roxy Music, to Queen, to Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, to Jethro Tull, Yes and Genesis, to Styx and Kansas, to the Ramones, The Sex Pistols and the Clash. To Blondie, The Talking Heads, Joy Division, Gary Numan, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, to Journey, Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, Poison, Motley Crue, to Nirvana, Jane's Addiction and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. All of the artists listed, play in the rock music genre, however, their style of music is not at all the same (e.g. The Beatles do not at all sound like The Talking Heads, or Chuck Berry does not sound like Electric Light Orchestra) because the genre of rock music is so diverse; which is why sub genres are used to describe music that sounds similar to one another or from the same time period (e.g. Beat music is used to describe rhythm and blues artists and groups from the UK in the 1960's, groups that belonged to this include the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Animals etc.) another example is Progressive rock, which was a sub genre of rock music that emerged in the late 1960s, it featured characteristics that were different for its time period, including, abrupt tempo, key and time signature changes, asymetric time signatures such as 5/8 and 7/8, very complicated rhythms, lyrical themes drawing inspiration from fantasy and science fiction, song organization that eschews the typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format,melodies inspired by the complexities of classical music and  jazz, and sometimes featured odd synthesizer programming, and sound effects. Groups that belonged to this sub genre of rock included, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Electric Light Orchestra, Yes, Jethro Tull, Genesis and Queen's earlier works. Giving a song a genre like &quot;Rock&quot; is not very descriptive, as rock music is a very diverse genre, and does not do it any justice. It would be like grouping the sky, a bucket of blue paint and a smurf (even though smurfs don't actually exist) based on the only similarity being that they are the colour blue, rather than looking for other similarities and grouping them more specifically rather than using something very general (like the colour blue). Queen's early work (Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera) very much differ from what they did later on. Grouping it all under the Genre is non-descriptive and extremely general, The song &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; is very much different from &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; would be grouped under progressive rock, because it features a classically inspired melody and deals with the subject of mythology, rather &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; deals with the typical subject matter of love and is played in a 1950's inspired Rockabilly style (a stark contrast to the progressive rock style of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;). The same goes for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in comparison to lets say &quot;Body Language&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is a very good example of progressive rock because it does not at all feature the typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format, abrupt tempo, key and time signature changes, features a classically inspired melody and features some elements of opera (e.g. &quot;Mamma mia let me go&quot;), and deals with the subject of death and mythology (e.g. &quot;Just killed a man&quot; and &quot;Beelzebub&quot;), which is a stark contrast to &quot;Body Language&quot; done in a dance-funk style and deals with the obvious and typical subject matter of sex (e.g. &quot;Sexy body sexy sexy, body I want your body, baby you're hot&quot;). Therefore, consider why you think this mediocre description of &quot;Rock&quot; does any justice to describe the genre of different songs and why you so desperately wish to revert any slight genre change, that does happen to make sense like &quot;Progressive rock&quot; or &quot;Rock Opera&quot;.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.109.133.175|24.109.133.175]] ([[User talk:24.109.133.175|talk]]) 17:28, 16 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::If you can find a reliable source that explicitly lists &quot;Progressive rock&quot; as the genre, we can add it. Otherwise, we should continue to keep all Queen articles under the same non-controversial umbrella. It's not our job as encyclopedia editors to add our own personal interpretations. I've heard the &quot;Rock is too general&quot; argument a million times, and it still doesn't make any sense. You're not the first one to beat that dead horse. I can't believe I have to explain this, but '''different songs sound different''', and we can't put a different genre for each different sound we hear. Genres are meant to '''group''' different subjects, not describe them specifically. If you want to mention progressive rock, add it to the article body. And as for your ''oh-so-iron-clad'' argument pertaining to imaginary Belgian imps that live in mushrooms: if the articles [[sky]] and [[smurf]] had to be linked together in the infobox by color, yes, the answer would be blue. I don't see what's hard to understand about that, and quite frankly, I think I lost a few brain cells reading the argument in the first place.

== Bismillah or Brit milah ? ==

[[brit milah]] is the circumcision. Re-read the text now:

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me

He's just a poor boy from a poor family

Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come easy go -- will you let me go?

Brit milah! No! We will not let you go! -- Let him go!

Never let you go! -- Let me go!

Never let me go! -- ooo

No, no, no!

Oh Mama mia, Mama mia! Let me go!

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!

&quot;

That devils is of course the man/father cutting his son.

Makes more sense? --[[User:SvenAERTS|SvenAERTS]] ([[User talk:SvenAERTS|talk]]) 00:09, 5 December 2012 (UTC)

== Suicide? ==

When it comes to interpreting the meaning behind Bohemian Rhapsody's lyrics, I was surprised not to see it mentioned that the song could be about a man contemplating suicide. When hearing &quot;Mama, just killed a man,&quot; I always assumed that the &quot;man&quot; he was referring to was himself. It doesn't necessarily mean that he has gone through with it, but it could be that he's running through the scenario in his mind and imagining what he would say and how he would justify it if he did. In this context, &quot;I don't want to die,&quot; makes a lot of sense. It illustrates the cognitive dissonance a person experiences when contemplating suicide. It's quite possible that the song is about a man's internal struggle about whether he should end his own life. In a vulnerable moment of crisis like this, it's also natural that the character might, in his own mind, direct his internal dialogue toward his mother. I am not a Wikipedia expert; could someone advise on whether or not this would be an appropriate inclusion?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.6.71.100|24.6.71.100]] ([[User talk:24.6.71.100|talk]]) 16:54, 16 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Ambiguity resolved ==

With regard to the phrase &quot;accusing him/her of betrayal and abuse&quot;, if the singer is a man, which Freddie Mercury is, don't you think it would be better to say &quot;accusing her&quot;? Because a man is speaking to a woman, not to another man, when he sings the word &quot;baby&quot;. At least that's my viewpoint and I'm going to edit that part.--[[User:Fandelasketchup|Fandelasketchup]] ([[User talk:Fandelasketchup|talk]]) 09:08, 23 May 2013 (UTC)
:I reverted it since, as you said, &quot;that's my viewpoint and I'm going to edit that part&quot; and viewpoint doesn't have anything to do with it. Since the person is simply a &quot;you&quot; and doesn't have a specified gender it could be either. Plus there's the fact that Queen has used ambiguity regarding the gender of addressed persons in other songs intentionally.

The article states that Bb Mixolydian is based on the notes of the Eb scale. That would be Bb Lydian. Bb Mixolydian is based on the notes of the F [[Special:Contributions/24.148.29.92|24.148.29.92]] ([[User talk:24.148.29.92|talk]]) 01:02, 20 September 2013 (UTC)Major scale.
