==Re:Moonview Sanctuary==
The draft is making progress, but the article is still problematic. Most of the article is based on a case study. Such information should only be included if it can be referenced to a neutral third party source. For information from a case study to be included , I would expect it to come from a reputable journal. A case study produced by Moonview is not a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]] for information on itself. - [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] ([[User talk:SimonP|talk]]) 16:31, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

==[[:Moonview sanctuary]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;A tag has been placed on '''[[:Moonview sanctuary]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of '''[[:Moonview sanctuary]]''' and leave a note on '''[[Talk:Moonview sanctuary|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Smartse|Smartse]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 16:19, 30 March 2009 (UTC)

: Hi, I've looked at [[Promises Treatment Centers]] and can probably tell you why it has not been deleted and why [[Moonview Sanctuary]] has been put forward for deletion. Firstly [[Promises Treatment Centers]] lists 7 independent sources, I'm not certain that your references are &quot;reliable sources&quot;. See [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]] for some guidance. Secondly [[Promises Treatment Centers]] does not list any information about which specific treatments they provide whereas [[Moonview sanctuary]] does - this in particular makes it read like an advert. I'm also not sure if [[Moonview sanctuary]] meets these guidelines either [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CSD#A7]] but considering the celebrity patients [[Promises Treatment Centers]] probably does. If you can rewrite [[Moonview sanctuary]]  in a simliar form to [[Promises Treatment Centers]] then I am sure it won't be deleted. If you want more info, please message me.

*The problem is not the content itself, it's a question of whether the subject matter meets our [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]]. You are welcome to voice your opinion on the deletion discussion above, but in my opinion there just don't seem to be reliable sources supporting the inclusion of this article in Wikipedia.
