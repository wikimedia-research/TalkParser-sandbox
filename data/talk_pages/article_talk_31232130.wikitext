==Proposed deletion of International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]
A [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] template has been added to the article [[International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice should explain why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend|its talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because, even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; [[User:Bongomatic|Bongomatic]] ([[User talk:Bongomatic|talk]]) 04:43, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

== Notification: changes to &quot;Mark my edits as minor by default&quot; preference ==

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled &quot;Mark all edits minor by default&quot;, which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse ([[Help_talk:Minor_edit#Should_we_remove_the_Preference_setting_to_.22Mark_all_edits_minor_by_default.22_.3F|consensus discussion]]). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in the next few days. This does ''not'' require any intervention on your part and you will still be able to manually mark your edits as being 'minor'. The only thing that's changed is that you will no longer have them marked as minor by default.

For established users such as yourself there is a workaround available involving custom JavaScript. If you are familiar with the contents of [[WP:MINOR]], and believe that it is still beneficial to the encyclopedia to have all your edits marked as such by default, then [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_default_asked_to_be_removed_in_bugzilla:24313|this discussion]] will give you the details you need to continue with this functionality indefinitely. If you have any problems, feel free to drop me a note.

Thank you for your understanding and happy editing :) Editing on behalf of [[User:Jarry1250]], [[User:LivingBot|LivingBot]] ([[User talk:LivingBot|talk]]) 18:59, 14 March 2011 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification==

Hi. When you recently edited [[Independent Examinations Board]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[St. George's College]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Independent_Examinations_Board|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Independent_Examinations_Board|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

A tag has been placed on [[:Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done for the following reason:

&lt;center&gt;''This redirect points to a section of an article. A new article with this name is ready.''&lt;/center&gt;

Under the [[WP:CSD#General_criteria|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not meet basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Woman&amp;#39;s Medical College of Pennsylvania|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:db-warn --&gt; [[User talk:Dcshank|&lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(50, 200,200);font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;:- )  DCS&lt;/span&gt;]] 19:42, 13 January 2012 (UTC)
