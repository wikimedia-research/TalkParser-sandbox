==Illustrated db Discography==
Added the link to the Illustrated db Discography. This should do the trick - very obsessed people will find what they're looking for, I'm 100% sure. [[User:XAVeRY|XAVeRY]] 22:38, 25 Sep 2005 (CEST)

I guess this page should probably not be a completely &quot;complete&quot; discography, as it would take up too much space, but maybe we could link to one, online...


== Just a few queries... ==

Is &quot;Love You Till Tuesday&quot; really a studio album? It wasn't issued until 1984, and is more a compilation/soundtrack album, just with some unreleased material...

I've got a similar reservation about listing Labyrinth there as well... half of the album is by Trevor Jones for a start...  Considering the amount of soundtracks Bowie's completed unique material for (When the Wind Blows, Absolute Beginners etc) wouldn't it make more sense to have a seperate soundtracks section?

Just a thought :)

:Hi Tom

:I know this is rather a late answer to you (3 years hence and counting!), but it bears recording my knowledge of the matter for reference. Although I am unable to provide verification on this without going into the loft and unpacking all my turntable LPs, there was indeed a vinyl album release, called &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; (lower case 'till'!), put out around 1972-73, when Bowie exploded onto the scene in full 'Ziggy' persona, and everyone (including myself) couldn't get enough of his work, never mind how simplistic his early stuff was (a la &quot;She's Got Medals&quot;, &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot;, et al, and those two were indeed on the hastily-issued album). I am pretty sure it will be up there, triple-bagged and boxed, as it is unheard of for me to ever throw out anything Bowie. Suffice it to say, you may have a conflict of understanding regarding exactly which &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; album we are talking about. The one I (hopefully still) have is definitely a studio album and not a live recording. This might be worth some further research by someone, but it's not something I wish to try myself. You should take my word for it, though, as a starting point. Good luck. [[Special:Contributions/86.112.67.18|86.112.67.18]] ([[User talk:86.112.67.18|talk]]) 22:09, 10 January 2012 (UTC)

==The Man Who Sold the World live album?==
What exactly is The Man Who Sold the World live album? I have never of a live album sharing the title ''The Man Who Sold the World'', in 1983 Mercury records did not own the rights to any of Bowie's material anymore, and neither the Illustrated DB Discography nor Bassman's David Bowie page mention a live album with this name, so this sounds dubious at best. -- [[User:Kjet|Kjet]] 15:10, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

:Hmm, it seemed to be a mix-up with the ''[[Ziggy Stardust - The Motion Picture]]'' album (release date &amp; chart performance matched with ZS-TMP), so I replaced TMWSTW with ZS-TMP on the list. -- [[User:Kjet|Kjet]] 15:23, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

==Additional External Link==

I believe that this is a directly relevant link to a unique resource.  The target pages have content that complements the current elements of this page and cannot easily be inserted into the existing article.

However as I am the maintainer of the external website I understand that my opinion may be biased and hence I am (rightly) prevented from making the change myself by Wikipedia's Conflict of Interest rules.  I ask that you consider adding this link and comment here.

:Hi. If I remember correctly, this website was inserted once before into the article [[David Bowie]] (8 December 2007), and reverted. External links are of secondary importance to an article (&quot;Wikipedia is not a repository of links&quot;), the primary reason for using URLs of sites outside Wikipedia is to reference or source the information contained within the article. Whilst your website may well be useful as a resource, it is not the purpose or duty of an encyclopedic article to supply links to such tools. If your website were to be used to reference or source information in the article, in the form of inline citations, then that would be a whole new issue. But as far as your request above, and in the related main article, goes, I am not in favour. Thanks.

== Worthy of being a featured list ==

The updates that were recently done to this page are excellent.  I suggest that who ever did them should have this page placed as a featured list candidate. [[User:Jimknut|Jimknut]] ([[User talk:Jimknut|talk]]) 22:11, 15 July 2009 (UTC)
:Oh I agree ;) That was my intention when I started updating the list in my userspace. Unfortunately between starting it and completing it, the BPI references for the UK certification levels have gone as they've updated their website and the certification database hasn't yet been put back online. Without reliable sources to confirm the certification levels any FLC nomination is bound to fail as not being fully verifiable. We'll have to wait until the BPI's database is put back online or I can find another reliable source for the certification levels. --[[User:JD554|JD554]] ([[User talk:JD554|talk]]) 08:27, 16 July 2009 (UTC)
::Well, then, good luck.  If you can get the page into featured list status I think it will be the first one for an artist who's career started back in the 60s, and also one of only a handful who's been recording for more than 20 years. [[User:Jimknut|Jimknut]] ([[User talk:Jimknut|talk]]) 18:46, 16 July 2009 (UTC)
::JD554, please justify your decision to remove lots of properly sourced (IMHO) national charts information for DB singles... E.g. why did you delete all the information about Italian DB singles chart positions?? [[User:Mlindroo|Mlindroo]] ([[User talk:Mlindroo|talk]]) 19:04, 28 July 2009 (UTC)
:::The main purpose of a discography is to show an artist or group's releases. The chart positions are really a secondary consideration. Keeping inline with Wikipedia's policies of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] (what makes Hit Parade Italia a reliable source?), [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] and [[WP:CHART|charts]], I balanced his relative success on various charts with Wikipedia's neutral point of view guidelines and provided the current set (which are definitely all reliable). Also, we can't list all charts due to the amount of information we can easily present, so a choice has to be made, again based on relative chart positions and what reliable sources are available, up to a suggested maximum of 10 charts [[WP:DISCOG]]. --[[User:JD554|JD554]] ([[User talk:JD554|talk]]) 19:38, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

== Australian singles charts ==

The current consensus is that there should be ten charts listed. If we were to include the Australian singles charts positions, we would have to exclude them from the 1990s singles table and that wouldn't make any kind of sense. This was an issue brought up at the recent [[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/David Bowie discography/archive1|FLC]]. Please respect the consensus. --[[User:JD554|JD554]] ([[User talk:JD554|talk]]) 12:42, 30 September 2009 (UTC)

:I wouldn't have honestly thought to look at anything like that. Maybe I should have, looking back, but don't you think that since David Bowie has probably sold more albums and singles in Australia than some of the other countries listed, (such as Ireland, Norway and Sweden) it should be listed in favour of them? Isn't that kind of a deciding factor on other artists' discographies; bigger markets over smaller ones? Just asking/suggesting. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6347&quot;&gt;[[User:Ss112|Ss]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#1E90FF&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ss112|112]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:26, 5 October 2009 (UTC)
::Not really, it's just to give an indication of how well he's done generally. The number of charting releases usually influences my decision on which charts to include/exclude and as I only have access to Australian-charts.com (which doesn't list the earlier charts), I decided to remove it as there weren't that many releases which charted (according to Australian-charts.com). If I had access to the Kent's book, I would probably have excluded Norway instead. I wouldn't object if you want to remove the Norwegian singles charts and add the Australian ones. --[[User:JD554|JD554]] ([[User talk:JD554|talk]]) 09:37, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Non-album singles&quot;? ==

Hi

I'm a little confused as to why &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot; is listed as a &quot;Non-album single&quot;, when any Bowie fanatic will tell you that it was clearly lifted from &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; for its 1974 release (the fact that it was such an important track, the final denouement, in such an important concept album gives some indication of why it only made Number 22 in the UK charts). Or am I missing some salient point here? I was tempted to wade in and make the change, but I am willing to wait for some alternative reason not to.  Hope someone has the time to put an explanation in here to clarify. Thanks. A lifelong fan (happy 65th birthday to him!).

:It wasn't released in to promote the album (which had been released 2 years earlier).

In my opionion The Buddha of Suburbia should not be listed as soundtrack but rather as full studio album as this is what it really is. Only one track was actually written for the tv serial the rest is completely unrelated.

:: alright, lets have a look at the wording of the original inlay sleeve: &quot;This collection of music bears little resemblance to the small instrumentation of the BBC play of “Buddha”. That project was manoeuvred and focused primarily by Roger Mitchell the Director, who guided me around the usual pitfalls of over arranging against small ensemble theatre.
