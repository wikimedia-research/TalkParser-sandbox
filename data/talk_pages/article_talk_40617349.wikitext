[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:IronGargoyle|IronGargoyle]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:Copperstone University]], but you didn't provide a source. I’ve removed it for now, but if you’d like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] to a reliable source and re-add it, please do so! If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:IronGargoyle|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-unsor-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; [[User:IronGargoyle|IronGargoyle]] ([[User talk:IronGargoyle|talk]]) 10:32, 24 September 2013 (UTC)
