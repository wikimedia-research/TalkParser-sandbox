== Location ==

Anyone know the actual location of the emergency undergroudn control room, apparently housed behind a shoe shop?

Dave
:It at [[RAF Uxbridge]] in North London you can visit it but it is still an RAF base so you have to book ahead.  It wasn't the emergency control room it was the control room all the time.  I don't think it was under a shoe shop it certainly isn't any more; it is very unobtrusive above ground though.--[[User:Shimbo|Shimbo]] 08:12, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

The Luftwaffe official stating that:
&quot;Die Engländer können nicht sowohl im Norden als auch im Süden zur gleichen Zeit sein.&quot;
Did one actully say that or was it made up for the film?

::Probably a 'composite' statement for dramatic effect.  The RAF could indeed be in the North and the South at the same time, because units were held in the the north of the country and not all 'thrown at' the main centre of activity in the South-East.  Don't forget that Germany is to the East of Britain-not the South, and (in addition to the German assaults on South-East airfields and London) a lot of German bombing activity at the time was on comparatively Northern targets. [[User:ChrisRed|ChrisRed]] 22:48, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

Indeed it is probably a composite quote, but it reflects the German belief that they had inflicted severe loses on the RAF, forcing Dowding to draw in squadrons from the North, leaving that part of the country undefended.
German bombers attacking the UK came mainly either from France, to the southeast, or Norway,  to the northeast, rather than Germany itself.

::''&quot;German bombers attacking the UK came mainly either from France, to the southeast, or Norway,  to the northeast, rather than Germany itself&quot;.''  True.  We know this '''now''', and in the case of fighter escorts, they could only come from occupied France or the low countries, but a quick look at the range of a He111 means that bombers '''could''' easily have been sent from any point of the compass between SW and NE that Uncle Hermann chose, including fairly deep within Germany itself.[[User:ChrisRed|ChrisRed]] 11:42, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Be that as it may, the overall concept related above is accurate. The Germans were convinced that the only reason the RAF could put up that many fighters against their raids in the south was because they had pulled them all from the north. An attack on the north, then, should be almost unopposed. However the entire concept was based on faulty logic; the reason they had so many planes is because the Germans weren't shooting down as many as they believed and increased production was making up for them. Both north and south were well enough supplied. [[User:Maury Markowitz|Maury]] 17:10, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

'The Most Dangerous Enemy' by Stephen Bungay would be good for the citation concerning the unorthodox view of the Germans switching targets to London.  (Bungay argues that Kesselring had a considerable influence on the switch to London bombing.)

== Buchons masqueraing as Hurricanes ==

:''the most distant &quot;Hurricane&quot;s from the camera were actually Buchons marked as Hurricanes as there were not enough flyable ones to make up the formation.''
Were they definitely Buchons and not Spitfires?  [[User:Man with two legs|Man with two legs]] 21:14, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

:You can't use me as a source, but I'm looking at that scene right now - it's about 93:00 into the film - and they're Buchons. There are three Hurricanes in the foreground, and three Buchons in the background. The Buchon's chin scoop is very distinctive. They appear a couple of times and then break off to shoot down some Heinkels. The RAF aircraft are supposed to be part of &quot;T5&quot;, which is described as a training squadron. Judging by [http://www.btinternet.com/~lee_mail/rafcodes.html this link], which could be nonsense, the film might not have been strictly accurate with regards to squadron numbers. -[[User:Ashley Pomeroy|Ashley Pomeroy]] ([[User talk:Ashley Pomeroy|talk]])

The 'T5' is not the qsquadron number but the actual plot number allocated in the control room, in this case to the flight of Polish-flown Hurricanes led by Barry Foster's character. This reference number was for tracking only as each plot on the table was given a letter prefix and number suffix by the Sector contollers. I assume 'T' is for training, and '5' as the number of aircraft involved. I seem to recall 'H' was for hostiles, and 'X' for unidentified plots.Thanks [[User:Harryurz|Harryurz]] ([[User talk:Harryurz|talk]]) 18:43, 9 June 2008 (UTC)  

::I wrote the original statement and did as Ashley has done, checked frame-by-frame to confirm that the aircraft were indeed Buchons but due to the distance involved, they are a bit hard to make out but clearly are Buchons. There were only a limited number of flyable Hurricanes available for filming. FWIW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 02:58, 13 March 2008 (UTC).

== &quot;Mark Haddie&quot; ==

The nickname &quot;Mark Haddie&quot; is a wellknown and well documented story from the making of this movie. But doesn't the sentence ''&quot;These modified aircraft are known today within the classic warbird scene as &quot;Mark Haddies&quot;, in a play on Grp. Capt. Mahaddie's last name.&quot;'' give the impression that these aircraft were kept in that configuration up to this day, as in ''&quot;today&quot;''? The reference dates back to 1968. As far as I know, they were all returned into original shape and versions after the movie was finished. --[[User:Towpilot|Towpilot]] ([[User talk:Towpilot|talk]]) 05:15, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

: It's a tortured piece of writing that could be a lot clearer, but it's not necessarily a contradiction; even if the aeroplanes had subsequently been scrapped or modified, their 1968 configuration would still be known as &quot;Mark Haddie&quot;. I have rewritten this to say &quot;became known&quot; instead of &quot;are known today&quot;. I assume that Mark in this context is a pun on e.g. model, rather than a real person called Mark. -[[User:Ashley Pomeroy|Ashley Pomeroy]] ([[User talk:Ashley Pomeroy|talk]]) 18:49, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

== The making of the film - Spitfire numbers ==

There's a sentence in the above section that's a bit odd and not really very clear:- &quot;In the late 1960s there were few restoration projects for classic aircraft and through Mahaddie's efforts, the film company located 109 Spitfires in the UK with 27 Spitfires (12 flyable) as well as six Hawker Hurricanes (three flyable) available for filming.&quot;. Is there any particular significance in mentioning that Mahaddie located 109 Spitfires in the UK when only 27 of them were used in the film?  [[User:Mighty Antar|Mighty Antar]] ([[User talk:Mighty Antar|talk]]) 01:36, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

::At the time of the film, there was little understanding of the scope of the British warbird community. The film producers had made a request to fly a veritable armada of authentic period aircraft with the belief that these examples would be readily available. Yet when experts were consulted, the first thing that was established was that there were very few aircraft of any type available and a comprehensive survey had to be undertaken to research each individual aircraft in terms of its availability for the film production. Many of the 109 Spitfires were unsuitable as they were either static displays such as those mounted on pylons as &quot;gate guardians&quot; or in various states of disrepair to render them unflyable. The reason for the inclusion of the details of Mahaddie's search was that due to the efforts of the Battle of Britain film crews, many of the existing airframes were &quot;discovered&quot; and the resultant publicity was responsible for the eventual recovery and saving of numerous Spitfires. Although other factors were involved, a concerted effort to remove aircraft used as gate guardians in the United Kingdom and replace them with full-scale fibreglas models was undertaken in the wake of the film production crews identifying bonafide examples that were suitable for restoration. Like the film ''Catch 22'', the ''Battle of Britain'' film played a significant role in saving warbirds. [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 02:21, 28 January 2008 (UTC).

== spacing ==

Can you tell me please what effect it has on your version of Firefox, because on mine it does exactly what it does on Internet Explorer, provides a little breathing space between the lede and the Table of Contents, and between the bottom of the article (usually the external links) and the navigation boxes.  What, exactly, are you seeing that these extra spaces do?

:And, no, the formatting of Wiki does '''''not''''' take care of this.  Wiki jams the ToC right up against the bottom of the lede, and the bottom of the article right up against the navboxes.  I find it ugly, and it makes the text considerably more difficult to read.  Any graphic designer will tel you that when and where to have a little bit of visual breathing room is an important consideration is laying out any text for publication, and that's certainly the case here, one that the Wikipedia formatters seem to have overlooked.

::Ed, there is no &quot;breathing space&quot; required; there is a format that WP:Aviation uses that provides for this. Your additional spacing leaves gaps in white space in the format.

There are no settings that I'm aware of which can make the kind of difference you're talking about, so if the exist, you have to tell me so that I can see them.  If I don't see them, then I'm going to continue to add those space whenever and wherever I can, because on my installations of both Internet Explorer and Firefox, they '''''make a difference'''''.  On that, '''''you''''' have to believe '''''me''''' -- I don't add those spaces for the hell of it, to be ornery, or because I enjoy pissing people off, I add them because it '''''makes the page look better'''''.&lt;p&gt;So, if you are in possession of some magic formula cooked up by the wizards of aviation, could you please pass it along to me?

== Use of images in article ==

This article has attracted some editors intent on removing all images. Can other editors involved in its development, please comment. FWiW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 19:31, 19 June 2008 (UTC).
== Origin of this paragraph, please ==

&quot;Although my stepfather, Lord Dowding, was born in the school founded by his father, St. Ninian's, Moffat, Dumfriesshire, his family came from the West Country. Hugh Dowding, his two yonder brothers and sister did not have any trace of a Scottish accent, and were all very English. (It is most annoying that some people write inaccurately about a person they did not know.) Sir Laurence was well aware of the Dowding family history, and I was present on one of his visits to our home in Tunbridge Wells to speak with Dad to perfect the image he was to play. Larry's difficulty was that he was much shorter that Dowding who was over six feet tall, and the uniform used in the film was specially cut to give him an appearance of being taller. Sir Aleck Guinness was the first choice to play Dowding, and he came to our house for lunch, but in letters to my mother, he does not say why he declined to take the part. A new biography of Lord Dowding's life is to be publishes 30 September 2008 by Vincent Orange, &quot;DOWDING OF FIGHTER COMMAND: Victor of the Battle of Britain. Jack Dixon's account of Dowding and his retirement from the RAF is to be publishes in November 2008, DOWDING AND CHURCHILL: The Dark Side of the Battle of Britain.&quot;

The designation: &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; is normally capitalized, and it was my understanding that the use of the term thereafter if shortened, as in &quot;the Battle&quot; should also be capitalized.

== Running time for &quot;UK original version&quot; ==

Does anyone really have a reliable source that this movie was 151 minutes at the British premier? And no, IMDb is '''NOT''' a reliable source at all so don't even bother! According to Robert J Rudhall's excellent and meticulous researched book &quot;Battle of Britain ''The Movie''&quot; about the making of this movie, it was in fact 133 minutes at the premier in UK, like everywhere else! Virtually all movies have a so called &quot;rough cut&quot;, before the final cut is done before the premier, but 151 minutes actually seems like a short rough cut for a movie that ends up only 20 minutes shorter.

== Squadron of Spitfires comment ==

I very much disagree with the deletion of my clarification of Falke`s comment about &quot;a squadron of Spitfite`s&quot;. This is one of the most commonly repeated myths about Spitfires/Me109s and I suspect that this scene in the film is one of the main reasons for it !
The original comments are insufficiently accurate and I would suggest anyone doubting this reads Galland`s book. If they did they would be in no doubt that the scene is misleading. Many people quote this Spitfires comment so as to prove that the German commander(s) would rather have had Spitfires than their own Me109s. Galland specifically rejects this. What is the point in making any comment on the scene at all if it`s not correct ?
I would suggest if these comments are deleted you may as well delete all comments on this famous/infamous comment, in fact delete the whole section ! --[[User:JustinSmith|JustinSmith]] ([[User talk:JustinSmith|talk]]) 08:24, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

== 'Dowding' - 'Park' conversation regarding the Poles and the Czechs. ==

The Dowding character says to 'Park' that the foreign squadrons are a danger to us and themselves.  I believe this to not be an accurate reflection of either the official RAF position or the private attitude of Dowding himself to these undoubtedly brave, experienced and determined fighters. References London Gazette 11 Sept 1946 Dowding's own words:- &quot;164. I must confess that I had been a little doubtful of the effect which their experience in their -own countries and in France might have had upon the Polish and Czech pilots, but my doubts were soon laid to rest, because all three Squadrons swung in the fight with a dash and enthusiasm which is beyond praise. They were inspired by a burning hatred for the Germans which made them very deadly opponents.&quot;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.104.247.33|88.104.247.33]] ([[User talk:88.104.247.33|talk]]) 21:34, 6 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Unfortunately, and all a matter of record, the conversation and the attitude were accurate reflections of the pre-Battle RAF stance. All the initial group of Polish fighter pilots were initially slotted into Fairey Battle squadrons despite their unfamiliarity with bombers and their previous combat experiences and training. The Polish were also not even allowed to participate in postwar Battle celebrations, even though their contributions were timely and significant. FWiW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 21:47, 6 August 2011 (UTC).

::The Poles and Czechs were kept back from doing more because many had a poor command of English and much of the vectoring by radar was by speech instructions from the ground. It wasn't that they weren't wanted, it was because they were thought to be a danger to themselves as well as to everyone else. Many just didn't understand English. At the time many had only been in England a few weeks and many spoke only a few basic English phrases. You can't have people flying around in armed aeroplanes who don't know what they are being told to do, especially when a reported 'bogey' may not turn out to be a 'bandit' after all but still risks getting shot down in error. And you can't have ground controllers speaking Polish or Czech because then the other English-speaking squadrons cannot understand either, as the relatively few radio channels available were shared by all.

::The whole point of the very expensive (and at the time very secret) British [[Chain Home]] and [[Ground-controlled interception|GCI]] system was that the interceptors were controlled by ''verbal'' radio communication from the ground - so the pilots needed to understand ''spoken'' English. The Battles, being bombers, were operated differently and so having a few squadron using a different language was not such a problem. For aircrew from the Commonwealth of course, this was not a problem as most had English as a first language, and many from countries such as Holland, Norway, Belgium, etc, had a smattering of English taught to them at school. So the Czechs and the Poles were rather a 'special case' in their limited exposure to English compared to the others. It is also possible that due to being from 'suspect' (i.e., occupied) countries initially, they would not have been made aware of the British GCI method of interceptions for some time, and the resulting importance of possessing usable English. So the delays in introducing them into the air fighting may have seemed puzzling, if not incomprehensible, to them, at the time.

:: ... so it wasn't that the Poles and Czechs in Fighter Command were not wanted - on the contrary, they were - but until they could learn to speak (or rather, understand) English reasonably well, they couldn't be used properly unless they just happened to be in the right place at the right time to make an interception. That's why they originally had a British officer leading them when they finally did 'enter the fray'. Because he was the only one who knew where the enemy were - the GCI ground controllers told him. In English.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.7.147.13|80.7.147.13]] ([[User talk:80.7.147.13|talk]]) 19:57, 17 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

All of the above is undoubtedly very interesting, I must confess I hadn`t thought about the overwhelming importance of them speaking English (or not) before [it wasn`t made clear in the film], but nobody has made the obvious point that this page is just a summary of the film, not the BofB itself !&lt;br /&gt;
Having said that I`d like to ask the question (somewhat inconsistently I must admit ! ), if the RAF were so very short of pilots, why weren`t (only) those foreign  pilots with an adequate grasp of English used ? --[[User:JustinSmith|JustinSmith]] ([[User talk:JustinSmith|talk]]) 09:47, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

:Because in the other Commands radio communication was only important at certain stages of flight, e.g., pre-flight briefing, landing, etc. A Polish or Czech bomber pilot only needed to use the radio on take-off and landing, and the briefings before take-off could be translated on the ground for pilots who did not speak English. For a bomber crew it was possible to brief them on the operation beforehand in their native language. In addition, it was possible to include English-speaking crew members who weren't necessary the pilot of the aeroplane, e.g. wireless operator, etc. 

:Fighter Command was different because the fighters were mostly single-seat (except for types such as the [[Boulton Paul Defiant|Defiant]]) and the aircraft were guided by radio instructions from the ground. So the fight was fast-paced and needed a reasonable understanding of English in real-time. Aircrew within the other Commands could all be briefed on the forthcoming flights while on the ground. So non-English speaking pilots tended to be allocated to the multi-engine types such as bombers or reconnaissance, as lack of English was less of a problem and could be to some extent compensated-for.  

:Another problem the Poles and Czechs faced was that they actually use a different spelling and pronunciation rules to most of Western Europe, so reading British maps of the areas over which they were operating was much more difficult, as locations of enemy aircraft formations were usually given over the radio by the ground controllers as something like '[[Scrambling (military)|Hostiles]], 120-plus, Angels One-Two, over Maidstone', 'approaching Dartford', etc., so the poor Poles and Czechs couldn't even find recognisable names on their British maps. Hence the wartime cartoon of a Polish pilot at an RAF eye test, and the optician responds to the pilot's first attempt to read the eye chart with; &quot;Just one letter at a time please Mr Baranowski, there's no need to pronounce the whole card&quot;.

:With single-seat fighters the lack of English made a pilot almost unusable (at least as perceived by those in the know at the time - remember the GCI system was secret and the Polish and Czech pilots themselves would almost certainly not have been made aware of it) with the GCI system around-which the whole [[Air Defence of Great Britain|ADGB]] was based. 

:Being unable to understand the radio instructions effectively nullified the whole GCI system, so the pilots would have needed to have been used for old-fashioned standing patrols (flying aircraft constantly on the off-chance that the enemy would come over), and the UK at the time didn't have the petrol to spare - it all had to come in by sea in tankers, many of-which which were being sunk by [[U-boat]]s.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.7.147.13|80.7.147.13]] ([[User talk:80.7.147.13|talk]]) 21:57, 20 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The word radar is used in the early scenes of the movie, yet the term was unknown during the Battle.

:I watched the film again and put on the closed captions which confirmed that the character's name is &quot;Warrick&quot; and is pronounced that way by both Susannah York and Kenneth More and is written that way in the captions.

I have two different DVDs, a collectors edition and the standard play, actually three different versions when I looked back at the VHS copy, and all agree with the same spelling.

::::Unbelievable! It really doesn't matter very much, but the two are variant spellings which are pronounced exactly the same! More precisely, they are two alternative transcriptions of the same name. --[[user:xensyria|xensyria]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:xensyria|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:31, 20 January 2011 (UTC)
:::::...and more unbelievable that the script lists only &quot;Warrick&quot; not any other spelling variation? and please listen to the film, if the producers had wanted to call the character &quot;Warwick&quot; but had lead actors pronounce his name in a dialect variation, sounding like &quot;war-rick&quot;, then they would have listed the character as Warwick, they did not. FWiW, see Mosley 1969, p. 181, that quotes script notes, script lines and character names directly from the set where the author had been able to work closely with the production, the exact same way that they appear in the film, DVD and Internet copies.

::::::The book does seem to be a reliable source so I agree that the name should stand as Warrick in the article, but an accurate note should be included; this isn't a case of dialect or accent – that's simply how Warwick is pronounced the world over. Very few people have ever read the script, and by far the majority refer to the character as Mr Warwick: compare a Google search for battle of britain + &quot;[http://www.google.com/search?q=battle+of+britain+%22mr+warwick%22 Mr Warwick]&quot; (615 hits) to &quot;[http://www.google.com/search?q=battle+of+britain+%22mr+warrick%22 Mr Warrick]&quot; (165) also see [[WP:Common usage]]: while it may be a mistake it's still the most common spelling.

:::You aren't seriously proposing that google search comparisons are a valid reason for a change?! IMDb is likely the reason for this error, and it has been propagated that way ever since, as it often happens that errors in an initial source are repeated ad nauseum by later tertiary sources. Other more reliable sources such as TCM, the original script and Moseley's behind-the-scene book have the correct spelling, but regardless, the character's name is &quot;Warrick&quot;; the actors do not make an error (just listen to the film, without the canard of they are mispronouncing Warwick as a predetermined premise). There is a also very conspicuous other pronunciation of &quot;War-wick&quot; that flies in the face of the &quot;could they be pronouncing Warwick as &quot;war-ick&quot; argument.&quot; The production house that has captioned all the video and DVD copies also have the correct spelling. For the sake of accuracy, I have attached a note to the article, and due to the influence of Wikipedia, just wait and see what those precocious google search comparisons will look like in a few years. Meanwhile, a person could simply try to report the error to IMDb and hope they will eventually correct their original mistake.

::::::LOL! - it's spelt [[Warwick]] but pronounced 'Worrick' - it has been for the last millenium or-so. As is this one [[Vickers Warwick]] and this one [[Dionne Warwick]] - if you don't believe me, ask her. They all come from the name of the English town/county. Presumably someone unfamiliar with the spelling/pronunciation spelt the name phonetically in the titles on the US release.

:::::: ... having written the above, it is always possible that the character's name ''was'' spelt 'Warrick' in the script - but 'Warwick' is the more usual spelling.

{{OD}} Repeating ad nauseum, I have seen the British screen copy and again, the spelling is &quot;Warrick&quot;, the same as it is in the captions on the worldwide tele, VHS, DVD and Blue Ray releases, as well as more tellingly, in the script, on TCM Reviews and the contemporary behind-the-scenes account written by Leonard Mosley. That it was spelled differently on one UK version is likely attributed to an error that I can almost trace back to the one place where the spelling is consistently &quot;Warwick&quot; and that is, IMDb.

:Probably because the original transcribers were American and, like you, clueless about British spelling and pronunciation. Unlike you, the makers of the BlueRay disc have recognized the mistake and corrected it. A number of people have patiently attempted to explain to you that, in Britain, the name ''[[Warwick]]'' is pronounced WORR-ick, exactly as enunciated in the [[Received Pronunciation]] of Susannah York in the scene in question. It has become painfully evident that, for some reason, you simply will not listen. I shall, therefore, not waste my breath. It is, however, fortunate that no-one in the film is named Menzies, Berkeley, Strachan, Home, Dalziel or Marjoribanks (to name just a few) and that no mention is made of Norwich, Beaulieu, Cholomondley, Leicester, Hawick, Southwell, Bicester or Worcester (to name a few more), otherwise we would be here all year having the [[List of names in English with counterintuitive pronunciations|spelling of British names]] [[Teaching grandmother to suck eggs|explained to us]].

{{OD}} Remember to be civil, FYI, Canadians do know about British inflections, pronounciations and spelling. The original VHS, DVD and script, plus a number of other sources identify &quot;Warrick&quot; as well, the Leonard Mosley &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; book, actually reproduces a number of pages of the script and lists the spelling as given in the film script. LOL: be sure to take care getting off your high horse. [[User:Bzuk|FWiW  Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 21:28, 22 January 2013 (UTC).

::&quot;Calling BS here&quot; is civil? Similarly &quot;LOL: be sure to take care getting off your high horse&quot;? Pot, kettle, black. It is also worth noting that you have changed your argument from &quot;all people have to do is to listen to the dialogue on screen and make their own conclusions&quot; (which, I must say, does not support your claim of familiarity with British pronunciation) to &quot;It's there in [[Bible errata|black and white]].&quot; Nonetheless, the question remains ''What is the man's name?'' I, like all the other Britons here, would contend it is ''Warwick'' because that is how the word spoken by Susannah York is spelled in Britain and this is, after all, a film set in Britain, about British events and with a (mainly) British cast (happily, Mssrs Spielberg and Ambrose were not involved in its production). Whence, then, ''Warrick''? We do not have to look far: this is the American spelling of the name and, certainly, Americans were involved in the film's production. There would seem to be two possibilities. First, that the documents to which you refer are derived from the soundtrack, from which an American transcriber made the same mistake you do when listening to Susannah York, and this became perpetuated. Second, I suppose it is faintly possible that the name was butchered in the original production so that American personnel would know what Susannah York was saying. Either way, would a real Second World War RAF Warrant Officer (at least, one with Michael Bates's accent) have had an American name? I really don't think so, any more than Hurricanes had tailplane struts. [[User:Wally Wiglet|Wally Wiglet]] ([[User talk:Wally Wiglet|talk]]) 17:04, 23 January 2013 (UTC)

== A British film - not &quot;UK/US&quot; ==

At &quot;Country&quot;, the infobox claims that Battle of Britain is a &quot;UK/US&quot; film , although all recognised sources claim that it is solely British, such as [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064072/combined IMDb], [http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6a4be8e5 BFI]. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17443/Battle-of-Britain/ TCM], [http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v4315 Allmovie] and the very meticulously maintained database at the [http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=13633&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx?id%3d1225%26epslanguage%3dsv%26searchword%3dBattle+of+Britain%26type%3dMovieTitle%26match%3dBegin%26page%3d1%26prom%3dFalse Swedish Film Institute]. It's not listed at all by [http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/search.aspx?s= AFI], which means that AFI doesn't regard it an American film.

The official production company was Spitfire Productions Ltd (a British company specifically formed for this film and later dissolved), and the copyright is held by Harry Saltzman's company Stevens S.A. (which also holds the copyright to ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]''). Yes, United Artists handled the distribution of the film in a number of countries, and undoubtedly supplied much of the financing in order to get the distribution, and also apparently had some sway over the choice of music. However, United Artists didn't request production credit nor supplied any executive producers, which is normal for any company heavily involved in the financing of the film. Consequently, the film is registered as British only.

I attempted to correct this earlier today, but my change was immediately reverted by a user who stated that he found it &quot;doubtful&quot; that it was a British only film, because of the conflict over the music. However, according to the template documentation for [[Template:Infobox film]], &quot;Country&quot; should list the production countries as stated in reliable databases such as BFI and AFI - and those who state it, all say that the film is British. As I don't want an edit war over this issue, I leave it to someone else to decide what to do. Cheers!

== Change of ending quote ==

I've moved the bit about changing the quote at the end of the film down a bit - it's not really plot related but more about the release itself.

However, I'm pretty sure the copy I have ''is'' the 2004 DVD release, and it ends with the Few. Does the altered quote only appear in that specific version, Region 2?

== How much money overall did the &quot;Battle Of Britain&quot; make (or lose) ==

In the article it`s stated that on it`s release at cinemas the film lost money. However, since then it must have made significant amounts in repeated viewings on the TV, video/DVD sales and use of the footage in various documentaries. It seems these days you can`t view any programme about the B of B without seeing excerpts of the film ! The lastest example I`ve seen being &quot;Fighting the Blue&quot;. Does anyone know if, overall counting everything in, the film still made a loss ?--[[User:JustinSmith|JustinSmith]] ([[User talk:JustinSmith|talk]]) 16:53, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

== Historical accuracy ==

It's noted that the film makes no mention that Dowding and Park were replaced after the campaign - but the film's about the Battle of Britain, not its aftermath. Anyone think it'd be reasonable to delete the reference to the non-mention of the replacement?
