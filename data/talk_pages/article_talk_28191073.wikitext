==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Business Architecture - Building Blocks]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Business Architecture - Building Blocks]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] as well as [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Business Architecture - Building Blocks|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Business Architecture - Building Blocks|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; '''&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;[[User:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Acroterion&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''' 11:50, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

==Advice==
I think I need  to give you some very specific and also some more general advice about your articles. I recognize your subject expertise, but nonetheless, Wikipedia has its own conventions and methods, as expressed un our policies and guidelines and common practices.  Of all the admins in Wikipedia, I am perhaps one of the most sympathetic to the need for articles on business processes.   Like many here, I   have some background of my own in information science, and feel a little more comfortable evaluating articles relating to business information systems than in business generally. I think that some of the articles you are working on are very far out from what we usually do here. I will defend articles on such topics--I have defended many,sometimes with success--but I will not defend articles written in the way you have been doing.
 
In the real world, this subject area had many overlapping concepts, but encyclopedia articles need to be distinct and to clarify them. It is not usually a good idea to write extensive articles on very closely related concepts of this sort, but to pick the most usual terminology, write a comprehensive article on it, and then make redirects from alternatives and near synonyms, explaining the use of the near synonyms in the article. If they really are distinct enough for separate articles, the articles must explain in the beginning the distinctions between the different terms. or they will be confusing. What most people do with confusing articles, if they cannot readily fix them, is nominate them for deletion, and who can blame them?

In the real world, this subject area uses extensive jargon. Some of it is necessary when there is no other exact way to write about something, but most of the time it is not. Jargon that is commonly used should be explained in an article, but it should be explained as much as possible in ordinary English. Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia  for general readers. We can &amp; should cover specialized topics, but when we do so, we cover them in such a way as to actually explain them to the general reader. additionally, some people here really hate this sort of jargon, and are very apt to nominate articles written in it for deletion--and I do not blame them either!  

In the real world, much discussion of these topics is somewhat didactic, explaining things many times over. But Wikipedia is an encyclopedia , not a textbook. Encyclopedic writing is concise: the articles should be relative short and straightforward, saying what is necessary, not saying things many times over. Encyclopedic writing is also straight-forward, not using rhetoric.  Sentences should be worded as simply as possible, without unnecessary introductory phrases and qualifiers.Almost half of our readers have other native languages than English, and Wikipedia is written to accommodate them also. (And the English Wikipedia articles are often used as the basis for translation into other languages, which requires exceptional clarity; rhetorical wording does not translate well.  

Wikipedia is written in English, not in Powerpoint.  We use diagrams when they clarify, not just when they decorate. The diagrams must be readable, including on low resolution and small size monitors. Using a diagram or a table  to present text is almost never justified. a table should be used to present data, a diagram to show relationships that are hard to present clearly in words alone. Excessive diagrams are a hallmark of textbook style, not encyclopedias.  Outline or list style is used only where necessary: normally prose is better, except when a mere list gives adequate information. An encyclopedia article is not a class presentation. 

Four points of style: We make appropriate internal links within an article, and do this in preference to see alsos. Wikipedia is hypertext, and see also links are really needed only when they cannot be worked into the text of an article. We also avoid internal capitals.  &quot;Customer Relationship&quot; should be written &quot;customer relationship&quot; or, at the beginning of a sentence, &quot;Customer relationship&quot;. (We also avoid italics for concepts, unless it is essential for clarity.) We avoid unnecessary adjectives: &quot; an enterprise can easily describe their business model&quot; should not have the &quot;easily&quot;. Terms that have multiple meanings need to be specified. &quot; architecture&quot; needs to be written &quot;computer architecture&quot; or whatever the specific meaning is. . 

The article [[Business Model Canvas]] relies much too heavily on sources you yourself have written. If it is notable, others will have written on it also. Do not add references to your own papers or books. Let others add them if they think them relevant. 
At the very least, make certain you have excellent references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources. Otherwise, how can anyone tell if it is just you who think it's important? (for published papers, citation figures are helpful) 

I moved the article [[Business Architecture – Building Blocks]] to [[Building blocks (enterprise architecture)]], which is I think your meaning. I do not think business architecture can be discriminated from enterprise architecture, and this is the usual way we qualify terms.  

 
And there's one further point. Your user page is excessively promotional. It's appropriate to have biographic information in a user page, but not purely promotional puffery , such as &quot;Mark von Rosing is a highly dedicated and passionate leading figure in the following research areas:&quot;  The best thing would be to give this page some careful editing yourself, or I will be faced with the choice between either editing it myself, or listing it for deletion.  


I think the best course  is for you to rewrite them more in accord with our expectations. Otherwise, I shall try to rewrite them myself, to prevent the otherwise very likely deletion of the articles, and I am sure you can do a better job than I. Please understand that I would not write in such detail except that we very much need articles on these subjects, and I appreciate the work you have put into them.

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, Markvonrosing. We [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome]] your contributions to Wikipedia, but if you are affiliated with some of the people, places or things [[Special:Contributions/Markvonrosing|you have written about]] on Wikipedia, you may need to consider our guidance on [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. 

All editors are required to comply with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] content policy.  People who are very close to a subject often have a distorted view of it, which may cause them to inadvertently edit in ways that make the article either too flattering or too disparaging.  People with a close connection to a subject are not absolutely prohibited from editing about that subject, but they need to be especially careful about ensuring their edits are verified by [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] and writing with as little bias as possible.  

If you are very close to a subject, here are some ways you can reduce the risk of problems:

*'''Avoid or exercise great caution when editing or creating''' articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with.
*'''Be cautious about deletion discussions'''.  Everyone is welcome to provide information about [[Wikipedia:Independent sources|independent sources]] in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|deletion discussions]], but avoid advocating for deletion of articles about your competitors.
*'''Avoid linking''' to the Wikipedia article or website of your organization in other articles (see [[Wikipedia:Spam]]).
*'''Exercise great caution''' so that you do not accidentally breach Wikipedia's content policies. 

Please familiarize yourself with relevant content policies and guidelines, especially those pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability of information]], and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiographies]].

For information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].

The article will be discussed at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Building blocks (enterprise architecture) ]] until a consensus is reached, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. The nomination will explain the policies and guidelines which are of concern. The discussion focuses on high-quality evidence and our policies and guidelines.

Users may edit the article during the discussion, including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion.

As a university lecturer and researcher, I am not interested in promoting or advertise anything, besides the knowledge of the research, and I have already re-written and agreed on this subject with another Wiki editor in the past. Obviously, I will quote the right references (which there are much more in the meantime), however, I will make sure to not even mention or refer at all to Mr. von Scheel (even though I don't know why there seems to be an issue here). But I can guarantee that I will re-work the subjects that I've written about and also make sure to add more references.

Could you perhaps write a small, more easily-accessible bullet list of things that I need to pay attention to when re-writing the subjects? Anything that can help me better understand the procedures and guidelines for effective encyclopedia writing, thank you.

Also, one question for you. It has been interpreted as my work seems very self-promoting and advertising, which makes me wonder why an article such as [[Business Model Canvas]] also appears to be heavily promoting Mr. Osterwalder's person. I find it very difficult to see the difference between that article being encyclopedia correct, but mine is not?

Also, with regards to multiple accounts, its because I have one for myself as well (besides the one used as a representative for Mr. von Rosing. I can delete my own personal account, though, as I never really use it. [[User:Markvonrosing|Markvonrosing]] ([[User talk:Markvonrosing#top|talk]]) 09:32, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

PS: It seems that using the unblock request feature is the only way of getting in touch with a moderator, so that's why I'm using it. I was unable to put this text unto FisherQueen's talk page.[[User:Markvonrosing|Markvonrosing]] ([[User talk:Markvonrosing#top|talk]]) 06:48, 10 November 2012 (UTC)|decline=You have your own personal account.

First, why would you need to contact a moderator directly?  As I am most certain you have researched [[WP:GAB|how to request an unblock]], you'll know that there's no need: your unblock is in the hands of the community at the moment.  As a university lecturer, I'm certain also that you have taken the time to research Wikipedia before choosing to edit.  Policies such as [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]], [[WP:PROMO|the fact that promotion means more than promoting a product - it can mean promoting a person or their &quot;concept&quot;]], and [[WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS|the fact that the existence of a possibly similar article cannot justify other articles]] (most lecturers I know studied logic to some degree, so that fallacy should already be known to you).  A few others include [[WP:SPA]] and [[WP:FIRSTARTICLE]].  Most importantly right now is [[WP:SOCK]].  You knew from when you first started using Wikipedia that you were not permitted to operate more than one account; period.  Promising to close one of them (when there are multiple) now is pretty hollow: the creation of the first one was enough for you to lose the trust of the community ([[User talk:Bwilkins|✉→]]'''[[User:Bwilkins|BWilkins]]'''[[Special:Contributions/Bwilkins|←✎]]) 10:25, 10 November 2012 (UTC)
