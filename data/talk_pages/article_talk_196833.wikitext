==Update==
This article needs to be diverged into &quot;lower esophageal sphincter&quot; and &quot;cardia&quot;. There is no controversy, the gastric cardia is now clearly considered to be part of the stomach. Because of its generality, it does however overlap with the LES. By definition however it does not contain the LES. The previous citations are erraneous and point to random labs and patient education articles, which should not be used as primary sources. In the medical and surgical community there is no debate about this issue. I have done my best to update the article but I don't have time at the moment to create the separate article LES.[[User:UberMD|UberMD]] ([[User talk:UberMD|talk]]) 04:04, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

==Old==
I'm not sure where this article was madse, but in the States, we refer to this junction as the gastro-esophageal junction or the cardio-esophageal junction. Cardia means hert. The cardiac region of the stomach is the most proximal region, closest to the heart, hence the name. I think this should be renawed to the brain.

There are 4 regions of the stomach: The cardia, fundus, antrum and pylorus.
:I tried a search in yahoo and find cardia like similar to LES ( Low Esophagical Sphincter) &lt;nowiki&gt;:?&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I am now more confused than ever. In reading various sources, there seems to be no agreement as to whether the cardia is part of the stomach, part of the intestine, or a little bit of both. Histologically, it is part of the stomach, meaning that its mucosal cells are stomach cells, not esophageal cells. Here are 2 diagrams that explain the ambiguity.

This page should have a link allowing people to redirect to :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia_%28Thrace%29  ---&gt;  I had to do a google search to find the wikipedia article.

In modern anatomical and physiological terms he cardia is the superior portion of the stomach.  The LES is a &quot;physiologic sphincter&quot; - anatomicaly it is not a discrete thing - its made of of muscles from the stomach and esophagus.  Therefore - LES should be its own entry and cardia should be merged with stomach--[[User:128.125.97.65|128.125.97.65]] 21:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

I agree. Another key component that is being excluded is its relation to the Angle of His. The Angle of His should be an article in itself (yet to be created). Its significance in surgery and GERD should also be discussed. [[User:Mednad|Mednad]] ([[User talk:Mednad|talk]]) 15:18, 14 October 2008 (UTC)

==Medicines==
Several types of medicines affect the sphincter, leading to their contraindication in cases of gastric reflux, could we add them to the article? [[Special:Contributions/79.145.199.212|79.145.199.212]] ([[User talk:79.145.199.212|talk]]) 11:55, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

== cardia controversial ==

Please read this famous pathologists theory of the cardia and how more pathologists are supporting his theories.  http://chandrasoma.com/page.php?id=6

I believe the information in his recent papers are relevant for this article.  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.43.212.236|75.43.212.236]] ([[User talk:75.43.212.236|talk]]) 02:37, 31 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== what separates the gastric cardia from the lesser curvature and fundus? ==

I have studied anatomy and it is not obvious to me, so I think this should be put in the article if someone knows.

==Link to [[Crus of diaphragm]]?==
Should &quot;crus of the diaphragm&quot; link to [[Crus of diaphragm]]?
