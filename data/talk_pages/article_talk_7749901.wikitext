Thanks for your edits. The article now appears to meet notability guidelines. I'll remove the tag. --  [[User:Mattbrundage|Mattbrundage]] 12:59, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

== Let It Snow... at least we tried ==

I tried the move that you mentioned. No such luck. You'll need help from an admin to delete your intended destination (which seemed to be a redirect page the last time I checked), and then you can have the article moved to the correct place (I'd ask him/her/it to do both at the same time). If time is an issue, I'd click &quot;Recent changes&quot; to the left and look for actions of an admin involving deletion, although any admin should be helpful if you catch him/her/it in a good move. Best of luck! [[User:B.Wind|B.Wind]] 16:07, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

==Image removal==
I didn't even get a chance to put my rationale on the photo and it was gone!  Restore the image or go to hell! [[User:Cheemo|Cheemo]] 16:38, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:Which image do you want restored? --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 06:40, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Oh nevermind. I'm tired of fighting the anti-fair use bots (and humans) around here. I don't come here every day or every week; I don't live and breathe Wikipedia. I just wanted to help out. It just so happened that, unlike some of the other images I uploaded that have been tagged by the Fair Use Fascists, the one that was lost wasn't being watched by anyone else who could come along and add the fair use rationale because I was too busy to find the template (which, by the way, are damned near impossible to find, as if by design). Indeed, the damn bot ought to provide a link to the rationale templates, rather than just to what it thinks is wrong, so that they can be found easily. OK, if you care ... '''[[:Image:Christmas Mood.PNG]]'''... It was being used in an article about composer [[Alfred Burt]] to illustrate the first public release of his famous Christmas carols. I certainly could have justified the use of the LP cover under fair use, because it was mentioned prominently in the article, there is no separate article on the album, and it was important to establishing his reputation.
