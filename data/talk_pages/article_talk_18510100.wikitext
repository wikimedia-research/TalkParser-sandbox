On what basis is this the &quot;proper&quot; name for the Roman religion?

==Strange name==
What a strange name. Why isn't it ''Cultus deorum romanorum'', or ''Cultus deorum romanus''. &quot;The roman thing of the worship of the gods&quot; strikes me as perversly indirect, even by latin standards. [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 15:00, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

*There are more google results for 'cultus deorum romanorum' than for 'cultus deum romanum', but only a few thousand for each, and I didn't find any definite scholarship on the subject. The former is much more direct, but you know what the Romans were like.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/169.229.109.115|169.229.109.115]] ([[User talk:169.229.109.115|talk]]) 01:04, 17 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I don't know what the article is supposed to be about, but I'm pretty sure it's already covered in [[Religion in ancient Rome]] or [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)]], and I've redirected it to the latter.
