==[[WP:N]]==
Please do not revert [[Symphony of the Damned]] and other Morgan Lefay album and artist articles without providing proper [[WP:RS|third party sources]] to indicate that the subject of the article meets Wikipedias standards for [[WP:N|a stand alone article]]. Also, note that [[[WP:ELNO|fansites are not allowed as external links]] and [[WP:NPOV|subjective descriptions]] such as what or who a band sounds like must [[WP:V|be supported by sources]]. Many of your recent edits to these articles have been reverted as not meeting wikipedia's guidelines for content.
:: Stop trolling, please. All these articles are definitely notable. Google search for &quot;morgana lefay sanctified&quot; contains 34,000 pages, &quot;morgana lefay symphony of the dead&quot; -- 229,000. Better do something USEFUL than removing information from Wikipedia archives. -- [[User:Angryxpeh|Serguei Trouchelle]] ([[User talk:Angryxpeh#top|talk]]) 19:00, 15 December 2009 (UTC)
::: Google hits do not equate to [[WP:N|Wikipedia's requirement of Notability.]]. Should you find legitimate [[WP:PSTS|third party]] sources that are [[WP:RS|reliable and not merely personal web pages]] feel free to restore the articles [[WP:CITE|while adding the sources]].

==License tagging for File:Amorphis - Magic &amp; Mayhem.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:File:Amorphis - Magic &amp; Mayhem.jpg]].  You don't seem to have indicated the license status of the image.  Wikipedia uses a set of [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]] to indicate this information; to add a tag to the image, select the appropriate tag from [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/All|this list]], click on [[:File:Amorphis - Magic &amp; Mayhem.jpg|this link]], then click &quot;Edit this page&quot; and add the tag to the image's description.  If there doesn't seem to be a suitable tag, the image is probably not appropriate for use on Wikipedia.

For help in choosing the correct tag, or for any other questions, leave a message on [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]].  Thank you for your cooperation. --[[User:ImageTaggingBot|ImageTaggingBot]] ([[User talk:ImageTaggingBot|talk]]) 15:06, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

== Notification: changes to &quot;Mark my edits as minor by default&quot; preference ==

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled &quot;Mark all edits minor by default&quot;, which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse ([[Help_talk:Minor_edit#Should_we_remove_the_Preference_setting_to_.22Mark_all_edits_minor_by_default.22_.3F|consensus discussion]]). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and you will still be able to manually mark your edits as being minor in the usual way. 

For established users such as yourself there is '''[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_default_asked_to_be_removed_in_bugzilla:24313|a workaround available]]''' involving custom JavaScript. With the script in place, you can continue with this functionality indefinitely (its use is governed by [[WP:MINOR]]). If you have any problems, feel free to drop me a note.

Thank you for your understanding and happy editing :) Editing on behalf of [[User:Jarry1250]], [[User:LivingBot|LivingBot]] ([[User talk:LivingBot|talk]]) 19:39, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for January 20==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Christopher Amott]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Green card]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Christopher_Amott|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Christopher_Amott|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;
