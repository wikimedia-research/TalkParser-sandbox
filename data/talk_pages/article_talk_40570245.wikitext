[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello and [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome to Wikipedia]]. When you add content to [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]] and Wikipedia pages that have open discussion (but never when editing articles), please be sure to [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your posts]]. There are two ways to do this. Either:
# Add four [[tilde]]s  ( &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; ) at the end of your comment; or
# With the cursor positioned at the end of your comment, click on the signature button ([[File:Insert-signature.png|15px|link=Wikipedia:How to sign your posts]] or [[File:Signature icon.png|15px|link=Wikipedia:How to sign your posts]]) located above the edit window.
This will automatically insert a signature with your username or IP address and the time you posted the comment. This information is necessary to allow other editors to easily see who wrote what and when.

Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-tilde --&gt; --[[User:SineBot|SineBot]] ([[User talk:SineBot|talk]]) 22:53, 18 September 2013 (UTC)
