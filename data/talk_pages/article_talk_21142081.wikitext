==Speedy deletion of [[:File:Curtis&amp;laila.jpg]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:File:Curtis&amp;laila.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#I3|section I3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an image licensed as &quot;for non-commercial use only,&quot; &quot;non-derivative use&quot; or &quot;used with permission,&quot; it has not been shown to comply with the limited standards for the use of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content]]. [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html], and it was either uploaded on or after [[2005-05-19]], or is not used in any articles. If you agree with the deletion, there is no need to do anything. If, however, you believe that this image may be retained on Wikipedia under one of the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|permitted conditions]] then:
* state clearly the source of the image. If it has been copied from elsewhere on the web you should provide links to: the image itself, the page which uses it and the page which contains the license conditions.
* add the relevant [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|copyright tag]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:File:Curtis&amp;laila.jpg|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:File:Curtis&amp;laila.jpg|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-noncom-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Ariconte|Ariconte]] ([[User talk:Ariconte|talk]]) 04:04, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Omari Hardwick]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Omari Hardwick]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Omari Hardwick|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Omari Hardwick|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

[[Image:Ambox warning.svg|32px|left|Replaceable fair use]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Maino.jpg]]'''. I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|first non-free content criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this media is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:Image:Maino.jpg|the media description page]] and edit it to add {{tlx|di-replaceable fair use disputed}}, '''without deleting the original replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:Maino.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, non-free media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006), per our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|non-free content policy]].  If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].

==Fair use rationale for File:TV Screenshot Hosea Chanchez.jpg==
Thanks for uploading or contributing to '''[[:File:TV Screenshot Hosea Chanchez.jpg]]'''. I notice the file page specifies that the file is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is not a suitable explanation or rationale as to why each specific use in Wikipedia constitutes fair use. Please go to [[:File:TV Screenshot Hosea Chanchez.jpg|the file description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|fair use rationale]].

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'file' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;File&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].

== Replaceable fair use Image:Media Shot Tammy Sutton-Brown 09-15-08.jpg ==
[[Image:Ambox warning.svg|32px|left|Replaceable fair use]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Media Shot Tammy Sutton-Brown 09-15-08.jpg]]'''. I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|first non-free content criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this media is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:Image:Media Shot Tammy Sutton-Brown 09-15-08.jpg|the media description page]] and edit it to add {{tlx|di-replaceable fair use disputed}}, '''without deleting the original replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:Media Shot Tammy Sutton-Brown 09-15-08.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, non-free media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006), per our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|non-free content policy]].  If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].
