== Discography ==
I own a C.J. Chenier album called &quot;My Baby Don't Wear No Shoes&quot;, but it's not in the discography. See, for example, here: http://music.msn.com/music/album/cj-chenier/my-baby-dont-wear-no-shoes/  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.217.140.115|80.217.140.115]] ([[User talk:80.217.140.115|talk]]) 12:23, 30 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
