This entry on Shackelford, California, has nothing on the history of the town. Does anyone know where its name came from? Thanks. Just wondering if the town's name had anything to do with R.M. Shackelford, who was in Monterey County in the mid 19th century.[[User:MarmadukePercy|MarmadukePercy]] ([[User talk:MarmadukePercy|talk]]) 16:39, 6 April 2008 (UTC) R.M. Shackelford came from Kentucky to California in 1853, and dug for gold.[http://ca-files.biofiles.us/Storke374-385.htm R.M.

:This article now contains this statement: &quot;The name ''Shackelford'' comes from ''[[shack]]'', due to the shacks that were first built, and ''[[ford]]'', because of the settlement's proximity to the [[Tuolumne River]] ford.&quot; This is almost certainly incorrect. The town is likely named for R. M. Shackelford. Or perhaps W. C. Shackelford, a Modesta merchant and president of the school board. I hope someone knowledgeable can get to the bottom of this.
