[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Grey nurse shark]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG produces very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|602797}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again. 
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Grey nurse shark]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grey+nurse+shark&amp;diff=451624924&amp;oldid=451564001 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/124.183.118.26|124.183.118.26]] [[User:124.183.118.26|(u)]] [[User talk:124.183.118.26|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.878243 on 2011-09-21T05:37:06+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 602797 --&gt;.

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Grey nurse shark]].
