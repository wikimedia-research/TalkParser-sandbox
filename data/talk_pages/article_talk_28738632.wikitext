[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. While everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of your contributions, such as your [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=385958354 recent edit] to [[:Petrarch]], did not appear to be constructive and was '''automatically [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=next&amp;oldid=385958354 reverted]''' by [[User:DASHBot|DASHBot]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* DASHBot produces few false positives, but they do happen. If you believe the bot has reverted your edit wrongly, it is helpful if you report the error so the bot does not make the same mistake again.  Please:

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Jblantziv]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Jblantziv]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about about a person, organization (band, club, company, ''etc.'') or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Jblantziv|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Jblantziv|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:intelati|&lt;font color=&quot;#FD0000&quot;&gt;in&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF5500&quot;&gt;te&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF8000&quot;&gt;la&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFC000&quot;&gt;ti&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:intelati|Call]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:57, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

== Speedy deletion nomination of Orch dork syndrome ==

Hello Jblantziv,

I wanted to let you know that I just tagged [[Orch dork syndrome]] for deletion, because it seems to be vandalism or a hoax. 

If you feel that the article shouldn't be deleted and want more time to work on it, you can &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title={{urlencode:Talk:Orch dork syndrome}}&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+page+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+ contest this deletion]'''&lt;/span&gt;, but please don't remove the speedy deletion tag from the top.

You can leave a note on [[User_talk:Zujua|my talk page]] if you have questions. Thanks, [[User:Zujua|Zujua]] ([[User talk:Zujua|talk]]) 02:26, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
