Hello, 68.194.250.110, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/68.194.250.110|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of your edits to the page [[:John Jay Scholar]] have not conformed to Wikipedia's '''[[WP:V|verifiability policy]]''', and may be removed if they have not yet been. Wikipedia articles should refer only to facts and interpretations that have been stated in print or on reputable websites or other forms of media. Always remember to provide a '''[[WP:RS|reliable source]]''' for quotations and for any material that is likely to be challenged, or it may be removed. Wikipedia also has a related policy against including [[WP:OR|original research]] in articles.  As well, all new [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]] must contain at least one reliable source.

If you are stuck and looking for help, please see the '''[[Wikipedia:Citing sources|guide for citing sources]]''' or come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|new contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have!
