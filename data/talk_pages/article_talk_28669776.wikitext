Can't stand those RED discussion tags! Must... make... it ...blue.... must...Googled penrig, and the vast reach of WP becomes evident yet again. The very first reference is to this article, and then there are at least five other pen rig references that have nothing to do with this term, and then a couple of abstracts of medical reports, designed for specialists. No dictionary in the scores held at One Look has a reference. WP is the only site that explains it for the layperson, that is, the person who is going to get laid.
