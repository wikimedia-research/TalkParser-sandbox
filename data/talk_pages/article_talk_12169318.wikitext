==Images==
In the Featured List discussion, Scorpion0422 said: &quot;The images on the right overlap into the sections below, perhaps the images should be shrunk a little or one or two of them should be removed?&quot; 

I added a couple of those images recently because the images occupied only a small part of the article height in a 1024x768 display (there's still a lot of extra space for images when viewed at that scale). However, I know that on a wider display the images extend down to the bottom of the reference list. I think the current arrangement is a pretty good compromise between small and large displays (I think 1024x768 is in the &quot;average&quot; range -- I know plenty of people who use a 800x600 display for reasons of eyesight), but your mileage may vary...
