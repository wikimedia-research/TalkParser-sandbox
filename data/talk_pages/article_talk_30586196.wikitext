== Sketch ==

I think that someone should add the Monty Python sketch link to this, Dennis Moore i think it's called. its all about Lupins

:&quot;...but we have plenty of lupins!  why don't you bring us something useful, like food, or clothing?&quot;  --[[User:Morbid-o|Morbid-o]] 20:01, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Clare College Crest ==

Hi there. Beautiful Clare College Crest. Is a vector copy available? I'd really appreciate a copy for the front of my thesis! Thanks. Tom Ford - taf26 at cam.ac.uk

== Lupins - Edible? ==

I have just purchased a tin of lupins from a deli shop in South Africa. The shop is quite upmarket and I don't think the quality should be a problem. I remember us eating Lupins in the old Lourenco Marques (now Maputo) in Mozambique in the early seventees. It used to be served with all meals as hors' de hourves (forgive the spelling). I tasted it and it still tasted a bit bitter. I read that the bitterness may be a sign of toxicity. Could anybody provide some more info??

Thanks,
Zirk Jansen

::I'm not quite sure, but if I remember correctly, some, even most are, but not all are (tons of species of lupines)...

== Lupins as an Introduced Pest ==

The section on lupins in New Zealand hardly presents a neutral viewpoint when it uses the terms &quot;pest,&quot; &quot;unfortunate&quot; and &quot;ignorance&quot;  without factual support.  There is no indication that the plant has properties, such as invasiveness, that render it a pest.  Even the New Zealand Department of Conservation regards only the Russell lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus) as a problem plant, and then only in unstable braided riverbed areas.  The fact that some individuals and firms distribute lupin seeds is not necessarily either &quot;unfortunate&quot; or &quot;ignorant.&quot;  It merely reflects a different policy view than that of the New Zealand government.  The proposition that a plant has &quot;escaped to the wild&quot; is ludicrous - that's where plants come from.  If the author wants to say that lupins were introduced into New Zealand without adequate consideration of the effects on the environment (which is probably true of most if not all cultivated plants in that island country), or that lupins have become invasive plants in the conditions prevalent in the New Zealand environment, he/she should say so and support it with references.

----

Clearly whoever posted the above comments was very offended.  But there's no question that exotic and invasive species have done enormous damage to New Zealand ecosystems (rabbits, possums, ''Hieracium'', etc.).  Just because an exotic invader is pretty doesn't mean it's not a problem.  It's not &quot;ludicrous&quot; to say that a plant has escaped into the wild.  Plants may &quot;come from the wild&quot; but this plant doesn't come from the wilds of New Zealand.  Incidentally, the diversity of flower colors strongly suggest that it has been subjected to a lot of artificial selection by humans, so it might be fair to say that this plant doesn't come from the wild at all.

Invasive species radically alter nutrient cycles and hydrology, affect erosion, and alter the competitive environment for native species.  As a nitrogen fixer, ''Lupinus'' has an advantage in nitrogen poor soils.  As it outcompetes the natives, it also increases soil nitrogen.  Many plants that are adapted evolutionarily to nutrient poor soils or other stressful conditions lack the ability to take advantage of increased nutrients.  As the vegetation changes the lupins are replaced by other exotic weedy species that are able to take advantage of the altered conditions.  Thus the whole plant community, its associated animals, and ecosystem processes are fundamentally altered in ways that are not suitable to native species.  This is amply documented in Peter Vitousek's long-term, in-depth studies of ''Myrica faya'' in Hawaii, for example.

New Zealand originally had about 2,000 native plant species.  There are now about 2,000 exotic species that have become naturalized (&quot;escaped to the wild&quot;), and perhaps another 25,000 that are grown in gardens.  No doubt many of those will escape eventually.  Just because this lupin species is not yet seen as a problem doesn't mean that it isn't, or that it won't be someday.  It has many characteristics of an aggressive invader - grows in disturbed sites, poor soil, fixes nitrogen, produces huge numbers of small seeds, etc.  The above author seems to have a deep personal appreciation of lupins, or at least of that species.  I think they're pretty, too.  But do you want New Zealand to become pretty much like any other temperate mid-latitude environment as in the northern hemisphere? Or do you want to see New Zealand remain uniquely New Zealand?  I strongly prefer the latter.

== Taxonomic classification of Lupinus ==
Current phylogenetic work does not support Kurlovich's subgeneric classification: New World lupines, including the ones listed in the description, are multiply derived from Old World lupines, making Platycarpos a polyphyletic group and Lupinus paraphyletic. In addition, the description given at the [http://koti.mbnet.fi/bkurl/Classific.htm web site] for subgenus Platycarpos does not even begin to do justice to the variation in the New World lupines.

See Ainouche et al in American Journal of Botany 86(4): 590 –607. 1999.

I have no idea where the tribe name &quot;Luppineae&quot; came from as well. Lupinus has been included in the Genisteae since at least Advances in Legume Systematics 1981. There is a citation in Bisby's treatment of the Genisteae for the name &quot;Lupineae,&quot; though, but that hasn't been used in the recent literature at all. I'm including subtribe Lupininae, as recent papers seem to confirm this as a monophyletic group.

== Lupinus as nectar source ==
I am finding these citations baffling, as in my experience and understanding, Lupinus flowers do not produce nectar ([http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0006-8071(197206)133%3A2%3C155%3AGOLVIV%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O#abstract Harding 1972].

== Could not find this on the internet ==

I removed this piece of trivia since I could not verify it. 

* In the [[Colin Hopper]] novel The Eye of the Wall the main characters are served lupin stew.

==Names==
Would it not be reasonable to name American species &quot;lupines&quot; and Old World ones &quot;lupins&quot;? And leave a note to that effect to the readers. That way, we could include[[biogeographical]] data into the list with little excess code... [[User:Dysmorodrepanis|Dysmorodrepanis]] ([[User talk:Dysmorodrepanis|talk]]) 20:22, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

== Here is a paradox for you ==

I just found out that Australia produces more lupins than the rest of the world combined. However strange, it is the Chileans reel in more money on it, than the rest of the world combined. A case  for Ripley?--[[Special:Contributions/82.134.28.194|82.134.28.194]] ([[User talk:82.134.28.194|talk]]) 07:18, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

== Specimen from Israel ==
The [[Judean Mountains]] range in both Israel and Palestine.  The contributing photographer, states this one was in Israel, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lupinus_pilosus_1.JPG so I reverted the description back to being in Israel (rather than as changed to Palestine).  We can ask an administrator to cast final judgement if anyone disagrees. I have no personal score in the Isreal/Palestine political issues and I am trying to stick to the provided facts.
