==Speculation is bad enough, but unreferenced speculation==
&quot;Of all 303 planets found so far (June/08) it has the most Earth-like [[insolation]] with speculated [[black body temperature]] of 262 K.&quot; - if you had albedo and emissivity possibilities I could see this, but where are they, and why those specific figures, so that you can say specifically (272°K) one degree celsius.

: albedo and emissivity are unknown for an exoplanet. But, we can compare the colour temperature and  intensity of light at the planet's orbit to Earth's. If you look at the spectral class, (G5V, T= 5407 K as compared to G2V, T=5778 K for Sol), and luminosity of the star, L=1.14 L&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt;, and the semi-major axis of the planet, a=1.051 ± 0.02 AU, these are all a remarkably close match to ours. It is very easy to find total [[irradiance]] as L/a² = 1.032 times what Earth gets in W/m². This yields an equilibrium temperature of just 2°C hotter, for comparable objects. (spinning spheres, albedo=0, emissivity=1) -- [[Special:Contributions/99.233.186.4|99.233.186.4]] ([[User talk:99.233.186.4|talk]]) 04:13, 14 January 2010 (UTC)

==positioned at earthlike temperatures ==
&quot;positioned at earthlike temperatures &quot;&lt;br/&gt;This reads like a really phoney expression.&lt;br/&gt;What is it really supposed to say?&lt;br/&gt;Maybe quoting the reference would make more sense? &lt;br/&gt;[[Special:Contributions/24.79.40.48|24.79.40.48]] ([[User talk:24.79.40.48|talk]]) 23:45, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
