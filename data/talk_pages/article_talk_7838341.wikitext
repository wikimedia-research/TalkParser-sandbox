'''Welcome!'''

Hello, {{BASEPAGENAME}}, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages that you might find helpful:
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
*[[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:Article development|How to write a great article]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on my talk page, or place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;

It is felt that the article you created at [[Lawrence Murray]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. [[User:Bubba hotep|Bubba]] [[User talk:Bubba hotep|hot]][[Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep|ep]] 14:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned fair use image (Image:DK Album.jpg)==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:DK Album.jpg]]'''. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, the image is currently [[WP:O|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see [[Wikipedia:Fair use#Policy|our fair use policy]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

==[[:Sebastian's Official Fanspace]]==
A tag has been placed on [[:Sebastian's Official Fanspace]], requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. This has been done because it is an article about a certain website, blog, forum, or other web content that does not assert the importance or significance of that web location. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|our criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 7 under Articles, as well as [[Wikipedia:Notability (web)|notability guidelines for websites]]. Please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources which verify their content.

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. To contest the tagging and request that administrators wait a while for you to add contextual material, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{hangon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the page, and put a note on [[Talk:Sebastian's Official Fanspace]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. [[User:Wikipedian27|Wikipedian27]] 22:29, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
: The same goes for [[Sebastian Mego's Official Myspace]]. Please, at the very least, review our [[WP:YFA|guide to your first article]] for some information about the kinds of articles we do and do not accept. If you continue to post inappropriate articles now that you have been asked not to, you could wind up [[WP:BP|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia.

A tag has been placed on [[:Sebastian Mego's Official Myspace]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

If you plan to add more material to the article, I advise you to do so immediately. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] which [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. To contest the tagging and request that [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] wait a while for you to add contextual material, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and state your intention on the article's [[Help:Talk page|talk page]].

==AfD nomination of [[Sebastian Mego]]==
An editor has nominated [[Sebastian Mego]], an article on which you have worked or that you created, for [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion]].  We appreciate your contributions, but the nominator doesn't believe that the article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion and has explained why in his/her nomination (see also &quot;[[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot;).  Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at {{#if:Sebastian Mego | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sebastian Mego]] | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sebastian Mego]] }} and please be sure to [[WP:SIG|sign your comments]] with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the [[WP:AfD|articles for deletion]] template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate.  Thank you.  '''Please note:''' This is an automatic notification by a [[WP:BOT|bot]]. I have nothing to do with this article or the deletion nomination, and can't do anything about it.

A tag has been placed on [[:Sebastian Mego]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

If you can indicate how Sebastian Mego is different from the previously posted material, or if you can indicate why this article should not be deleted, I advise you to place the template {{tl|hangon}} '''underneath''' the other template on the article, and also put a note on [[Talk:Sebastian Mego]] saying why this article should stay.

==Unspecified source for Image:599427280_l.jpg==

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:599427280_l.jpg]]'''. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{tl|GFDL-self-no-disclaimers}} tag can be used to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Fair use]], use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use]]. See [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user={{PAGENAMEE}}}} this link].

==Fair use rationale for [[:Image:Jump In! OST (2007).jpg]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
Thanks for uploading or contributing to '''[[:Image:Jump In! OST (2007).jpg]]'''. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  [[WP:FURG|here]].

Please go to [[:Image:Jump In! OST (2007).jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Rae.JPG]]'''. However, there is a concern that the rationale you have provided for using this image under &quot;fair use&quot; may be invalid. Please read carefully the instructions at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] and then go to [[:Image:Rae.JPG|the image description page]] and clarify why you think the image qualifies. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use, it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our [[WP:CSD#Images/media|Criteria for speedy deletion]].
