==Off Coord==
There can be a million different reasons a coordinate can be off. the most common one is. that a new runway was built down the road from the origanal dirt one. and even later rebuilt by NATO.
please dont change the listed origanal coordinate to match the modern field. if youv got a real problem please feel free to contact Mr. Jeffords [[User:Brian in denver|Brian in denver]] ([[User talk:Brian in denver|talk]]) 16:33, 7 January 2012 (UTC)
