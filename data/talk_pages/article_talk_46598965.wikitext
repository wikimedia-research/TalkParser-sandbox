==Welcome==
Hi &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;! Welcome to our fantastic collaborative project, where editors build articles based upon reliable sources and help each other to make those articles full of great, neutral information. 

I thought it might be helpful for your trip to have a place where you can ask questions along the way. There's a special place called the Teahouse, where you can ask any question you have about editing and get friendly help from trusted hosts. We'd like to have you as a guest. Drop by for a cup of tea anytime!

* [[Wikipedia:Teahouse]]

Great to have you on board!  --[[User:WillKomen|WillKomen]] ([[User talk:WillKomen|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

:Thanks so much for your friendly welcome [[User:WillKomen]]. I can't wait to start editing! [[User:AlaskaArticleEditor315|AlaskaArticleEditor315]] ([[User talk:AlaskaArticleEditor315|talk]]) 19:40, 3 May 2015 (UTC)
==Earth?==
Hey &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;, I see that you're from Planet Earth. I'm also from Planet Earth! I have been working on the Wikipedia article about Planet Earth from Planet Earth. Would you like to give me a hand? --[[User:GaiaGirl86|GaiaGirl86]] ([[User talk:GaiaGirl86|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

:Awesome [[User:GaiaGirl86]], it's my favorite planet! How do I get there? [[User:AlaskaArticleEditor315|AlaskaArticleEditor315]] ([[User talk:AlaskaArticleEditor315|talk]]) 19:42, 3 May 2015 (UTC)
::Great, I'm so excited!  There's plenty to work on and I could really use a hand. I'm so glad to have your help. I'll see you there!  --[[User:GaiaGirl86|GaiaGirl86]] ([[User talk:GaiaGirl86|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
:::Hey thanks for fixing up those typos &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;! I'm not too great with spelling so it's awesome to have you filling that gap. We all do what we're best at here, and it seems like you have some skills we can definitely use. I've added some more content to the article if you want to take a look. Cheers!  --[[User:GaiaGirl86|GaiaGirl86]] ([[User talk:GaiaGirl86|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
==A riddle==
I ponder a riddle for the few with clue, how do we know what on Wikipedia is true?  --[[User:SocraTease|SocraTease]] ([[User talk:SocraTease|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
==Reliable sources==
Hi &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;! I put this information on the Earth article talk page. It's some sources I found. Which one should we use? I'm so glad you're still with me on this. We rock!  --[[User:GaiaGirl86|GaiaGirl86]] ([[User talk:GaiaGirl86|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:CURRENTDATE}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
==Thanks! What now?==
Hey &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;, it's me again. I flew around the world but now I'm back on Wikipedia. Thanks so much for adding the information to the article. What do we do now though? What if someone wants to check the source themselves, how will they know where to go?  --[[User:GaiaGirl86|GaiaGirl86]] ([[User talk:GaiaGirl86|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
==The answer to your question is within==
Wikipedia has our preferences, and number one is high quality references. Enjoy these intellectual libations, drink your knowledge from inline citations.  --[[User:SocraTease|SocraTease]] ([[User talk:SocraTease|talk]]) &lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:currentdate}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
