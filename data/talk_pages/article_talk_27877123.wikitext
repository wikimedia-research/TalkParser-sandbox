Just moving over my comments from the mis-capitalized page:

:I mentioned in my edit summary (on the prior page) that more citations will help; I think the first, best citation will be a reference to the [[[Rolling Stone]] article mentioned in the first Biography paragraph. Also, if you take a look at the bottom of another musical artist's page, you'll see a bunch of categories; adding categories to this page will help overall navigation.

As a side note, you can move pages instead of blanking and redirecting; that's generally considered better, because it maintains the edit history and the discussion pages with the &quot;proper&quot; article.  If you're a newly registered user and thus can't move pages yet, you can always request that someone else do it on the Talk page.
