I think this needs a real article not just a disambiguation page. I am expecting information about active renal secretion via OAT (organic anion transporter(s)). Could someone create a stub to start with? I don't have the expertise. - Just &quot;OAT&quot; as search word directs me to Oat (the cereal) without any further options.

:I redirected to an article already in existence that is basically a stub. [[User:Cmcnicoll|Cmcnicoll]] ([[User talk:Cmcnicoll|talk]]) 23:18, 27 February 2010 (UTC)
