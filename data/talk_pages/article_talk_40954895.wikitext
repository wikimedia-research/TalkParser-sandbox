;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
* [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]] – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] – this is one of Wikipedia's core policies.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|living person]] to any Wikipedia page and follow [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons policy]]. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Help:Introduction to referencing/1|referenced]] with multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].
* No [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]] or [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]].
* If you are testing, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]] to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so]&lt;/span&gt;.
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], [[WP:ARTSPAM|advertising]] or [[WP:NOTADVERTISING|promotional messages]], and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]; doing so will result in your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].
* Do not use talk pages as discussion or forum pages as Wikipedia is [[WP:NOT#FORUM|not a forum]].

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on [[User talk:Dougweller|my talk page]]. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!&lt;!-- Template:Welcomelaws --&gt; [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 13:26, 2 November 2013 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:75.177.156.78|75.177.156.78]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:Peter Thomas (announcer)]], but you didn't provide a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the [[Help:Referencing for beginners|referencing for beginners]] tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:75.177.156.78|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; [[Special:Contributions/75.177.156.78|75.177.156.78]] ([[User talk:75.177.156.78|talk]]) 01:12, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Doniago|Doniago]]. I noticed that you made an edit concerning content related to a living (or recently deceased) person{{spaces|1}}on [[:John Michael Higgins]], but you didn’t support your changes with a [[WP:IC|citation to a reliable source]], so I removed it. Wikipedia has a strict policy concerning [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|how we write about living people]], so please help us keep such articles accurate. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Doniago|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-biog1 --&gt; [[User:Doniago|DonIago]] ([[User talk:Doniago|talk]]) 14:27, 11 December 2014 (UTC)
