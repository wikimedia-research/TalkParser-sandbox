==Orphaned non-free media (Image:Bluthcompanylogo.jpg)==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Bluthcompanylogo.jpg]]'''. The media description page currently specifies that it is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, it is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the media was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that media for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that all non-free media not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Orphaned --&gt; [[User:BJBot|BJBot]] ([[User talk:BJBot|talk]]) 12:08, 15 March 2008 (UTC)
