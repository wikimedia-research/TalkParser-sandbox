== Congratulations ==

Congratulations to all those who have been mangling this page over the last while, either in pursuit of political positions or just out of plain incompetence. For those who have been making coherent contributions, my sympathies.

Perhaps the 'current event' template should be modified to read, 'This article documents a current event. It will remain instable and probably unreadable until further notice.' [[User:Palmiro|Palmiro]] | [[User talk:Palmiro|Talk]] 13:51, 13 July 2006 (UTC).

== Area of the Shebaa Farms ==
While reading through the article, I noticed it claimed two different areas, 28 km² and 10 km². I went to the Shebaa Farms article and calculated its area using my adept skills in math (2.5*14). I assumed the page on the Shebaa Farms was the most accurate. Does anyone know the actual correct area? I will try to find a  source later today if I remember. [[User:RyanEberhart|RyanEberhart]] 14:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
:Okay, I found http://www.shebaafarms.org/briefhistory.html states that the farms are 25km². Can anyone find anything else to confirm? [[User:RyanEberhart|RyanEberhart]] 16:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
This page (http://www.meib.org/articles/0105_l1.htm) also gives the 25km² measurement, and the Israel Journal of Politics, Economics, and Culture describes the area as &quot;14 kilometers in length and one to two kilometers in width&quot;. A spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon claims that the Farms' area is around 10km². Presumably, the disparity arises because Hezbollah's claims to the Farms have been rather inconsistent: some sources describe the area as a set of 14 farms, while others regard the Shebaa Farms as the entire Golan Heights region.

==General Point on Original Research==

A lot of the article seems to be original research and alot of the statements lack citations. Perhaps this should be an ongoing task.

== July 2006 Conflict ==

This is getting waaay too long and detailed for something that has a reference link to a much-trafficked page of its own at [[2006_Israel-Lebanon_crisis]].  Needs a major re-edit, down to a few highlight of the main events, not minutiae of the naval attacks, for example. [[User:Tarc|Tarc]] 21:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

==&quot;citation needed&quot; nonsense==

Surely there's a better way to deal with disputed facts in this article, the {{Fact|date=March 2008}} tags just make a mess of a generally decent article. And many are needless... for example, in the first paragraph, the dispute over the well known fact that Israel occupied southern Lebanon until 2000. Do people feel that there is a need to make a citation to accompany every sentence in Wikipedia?? [[User:69.140.65.251|69.140.65.251]] 03:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:One of the fundamental rules of Wikipedia is that editors should cite their sources. &quot;If you add any information to an article, particularly if it's contentious or likely to be challenged, you should supply a source.&quot; ([[Wikipedia:Citing sources|see: Citing sources]]) Placing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Fact|date=March 2008}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in an article is a standard way to request that Wikipedia editors provide a source. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 04:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
::While I agree that  editors should cite their sources, that does not mean that every single sentence needs a cite. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Fact|date=March 2008}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag was grossly misused in this article over the past few days, with editors requesting citations for claims that have them, either later in the article, or sometime a few words earlier in the very same sentence that was tagged. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hezbollah&amp;diff=64068450&amp;oldid=64068137] as one example- the requested citation is right there, in the beginning of the sentence. The amount of  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Fact|date=March 2008}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags placed here by certain editors is misuse of the tag, and  borderline vandalism. [[User:Isarig|Isarig]] 04:14, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
*&quot;Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism.&quot; ([[Wikipedia:Vandalism|see Vandalism]]). It is very common for people to read a cited source and decide that it does not support the statement that it is cited in support of. When someone asks for citations, we have to start an assumption of good-faith. If you can document that certain editors are not acting in good faith (for example, by adding useless &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Fact|date=March 2008}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags) then action can be taken to block those editors from causing further disruptions. The first step is to &quot;talk to&quot; any editors that seem to be causing problems and ask them what they think they are doing. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 04:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

***I took a look at this example:&lt;BR&gt;

I do not doubt that Hezbollah has expressed support and sympathy for those groups, but it is not unreasonable for a Wikipedia editor to ask for citations to sources that document it. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 05:03, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Actually, most of the fact tags I inserted are due to the original research tone. As you know, original research is not permitted, hence we must cite. Sometimes one doesn't have time, ans putting a fact tag alerts other editors to the need to cite what appears to be original research. It works wonders and helps makes article better. We sometimes develop tunnel vision with things we already know and forget we are writting for people who might need sources because they lack knowledge.

==Wikify==

This important article is extremely bloated and lacks a coherent structure. I'm going to 'wikify' tag it. Any objections please follow up below. [[User:Nickfraser|Nick Fraser]] 10:32, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

== First Paragraph ==

The first paragraph claims the IDF &quot;still occupy &quot;Sebaa&quot; area in the south of lebanon.&quot; This statement, I don't believe to be Neutral - most of the world agree the Sebaa area to be part of Israel, and it is not under military occupation, only farmers live there..

Furthermore, the Shebaa farms were formerly part of syria, and though hezbollah and lebanon claims them, syria remained quiet until the possibilty of their return appeared. Then, it demanded them.

For whatever purposes, political or otherwise, Syria and Lebanon currently both seem to agree that the Shebaa Farms are part of Lebanon.  Israel, the UN, and the international community, however, say that the Shebaa Farms are part of Syria and the UN has verified that Israel's withdrawl from Lebanon in 2000 was 100% complete.

== Simple Question Regarding Logistics ==

It's rather NPOV on both sides of the dispute to recognize at least that, rightly or wrongly, the Hezbollah is firing Katyusha rockets from southern Lebanon into northern Israel.

My question is merely an honest logistical one, and I '''HOPE''' it can be answered without descending into a shouting match.

The essential question is this: Who is it that is supplying the Hezbollah with these missiles? Syria is an obvious candidate for two reasons: it both supports the Hezbollah, and as well, it geographically borders Lebanon, making the delivery of these missiles easy enough. Yet missiles are expensives, and Syria is not the richest of countries. Iran, on the other hand, also a supporter of the Hezbollah, is oil rich, and is considered by most to be the main supplier of military equipment to the Hezbollah.

There's only one problem, Iran doesn't border Syria ''or'' Lebanon. The only land route from Iran to these two countries is either through Iraq or Turkey.

Now Iraq is crawling with US troops, and it would be reasonable to assume that those shipping arms from Iran to Lebanon would avoid this route at all costs. However Turkey is also a strong ally of both the US and Israel, and going that route wouldn't seem completely safe either. Are the arms airlifted in? Are they brought by sea? How does Iran supply the Hezbollah with arms? [[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 20:45, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

Iran supplies the Hezbollah with weapons through Syria. Civilian and non-civilian flights from Iran land in Syria, and then the weapons are taken by trucks to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

== Intro is a Mess ==
This introduction needs to be cleaned up. It is too long, there are a number of incorrect citations, there are too many citations, and its simply confusing and poorly written. --[[User:Infernallek|Infernallek]] 16:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)infernallek

== Incorrect citation ==

In the second paragraph, the sentence &quot;Hezbollah...was formed primarily to commit genocide against Israelis and Jews&quot; uses [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201557.html this article] as its citation.  I can't really find anything in that article that supports that assertion, unless I'm not reading it properly.  Perhaps the Wash. Post link changed since this is a dynamic event?  Or it  could be a well-hidden act of vandalism? [[User:JD79|JD79]] 18:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:I think it's the wrong link. I dont recall seeing the word genocide there either.--[[User:Zereshk|Zereshk]] 17:26, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::Hezbollah has stated that they want Israel to be destroyed.  Explain how this can occur without genocide, even if you use other terms.

:::Well, they want the nation of Israel destroyed. They claim to not want every Jew dead though. This could, in theory, be accomplished by the establishment of a new Islamic government. The Jewish people in what is now Israel would then live under this new government. That would destroy Israel without genocide.

::::It's often called &quot;regime change&quot; if genocide is not intended. At any rate, the vandalism has now been deleted. [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 20:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

I love how people use the word &quot;regime&quot; to describe islamic government groups (or any group our government and media deems unworthy of US support).  &quot;Regime&quot; has a negative connotation, basically discrediting the organization in question...All too often, this kind of propaganda is used by the regime that rules the US of A.

:Regime simply refers to the government in power. &quot;Regime change&quot; is therefore &quot;change of government&quot;, and is without connotation, imho.

The claim in the first paragraph that Hezbollah &quot;founded in 1982 to fight the Israeli Defense Forces&quot; is not represented in the two citations given. I believe Hezbollah has a formal charter, and it should be referenced if we are to speak on why Hezbollah was founded. --[[User:Infernallek|Infernallek]] 16:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)infernallek

== Hezb'Allah ==

A couple of days ago the article had Hezb'Allah as an alternative (lit party of God). Could someone knowledgable about the subject explain why this is incorrect in usage or inappropriate etc.? Thank you. Also what pronunciation in English is preferred? Chomsky seems to use &quot;Hezb'Allah&quot;.... - [[User:Abscissa|Abscissa]] 22:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:I've always gone with Hizballah or Hezballah, simply because the name means &quot;Party of God&quot; and the Arabic word/name for God is &quot;Allah&quot;.  Therefore &quot;-ullah&quot; and &quot;-ollah&quot; don't make much sense to me.  However, I realize that Arabic is a rather nuanced language, so perhaps someone more familiar than me could clarify. --[[User:JD79|JD79]] 14:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::The word Hizbullah is actually correct. After the b there is a &quot;dhamma&quot; (euivalent to an &quot;o&quot; vowel). If they were written separate, your statement would be true. But the word Hizbollah is what we call in Arabic an &quot;esmun murakkab&quot; (composite name). The o or u attaches the first word to the second word, deleting (id-gham) the &quot;a&quot; of allah in the process. So the  transliteration of either Hizbullah or Hizbollah (or Hezbollah, Hezbullah) is correct. Same reasoning goes for Sheikh Hasan &quot;Nasrullah&quot;.--[[User:Zereshk|Zereshk]] 17:33, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:::Zereshk, thanks for the clarification on the spelling of Hizbullah, Hizbollah. However, I think it would also be helpful to know how to pronounce the word. It has been pronounced variously in the broadcast media: HIZ-bol-ah, HEZ-bol-ah, hiz-BOL-ah, hez-BOL-ah, hiz-bol-AH, hez-bol-AH, HIZ-bol-AH, HEZ-bol-AH (where capital letters represent a stressed or accented syllable). [[User:Drhaas|Drhaas]] 19:27, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

I added the proper [[DIN 31635]] spelling. For spelling issues, refer people to [[Arabic transliteration]], in particular to [[Allah]] for orthographical quirks of that word. For Arabic phonology (pronunciation of ḥ and the like), refer people to [[Arabic phonology]], this simply cannot fall within the scope of this article. The ''u'' is the nominative desinence of the ''hizb-'', see [[i`rab]]: it's hizbu-llah, not hizb-ullah.  Anglicize it (Hezbollah etc. are fine), or give a proper transliteration, but not some pseudo, intellectual-looking typographic fantasy like &quot;Hezb'Allah&quot;.

== Grammar correction ==
&quot;On January 25, 2004, Hezbollah successfully negotiated through German mediators Israel agreed on an exchange of prisoners. &quot; from Hezbollah after the Israeli withdrawal section doesn't make any grammatical sense. Editing when I figure out what it's supposed to mean. [[User:65.115.38.32|65.115.38.32]] 16:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Sorry, that was me. Changed to: &quot;On January 25, 2004, Hezbollah successfully negotiated an exchange of prisoners with Israel, through German mediators.&quot;

All the above mentioned are irresponsible remarks, neither Hezbollah nor Israel are fighting for the right cause. Hezbollah clamis its fighting for the Lebanon people and their lands,instead it got hundreds of cilivians killed for their caused. In my own subjective view, Hezbollah is just another terrorist group with their own agenda using the Lebanonese cilivians as shields for their &quot;cause&quot;. Israel on the other hand, they are a legitimate country with an aggressive and mindless, dumb, government. They are using the excuse of trying to disarm Hezbollah to invade Lebanon. At the cause of both Israeli and Lebanese civilians. Any government who is willing to do that with their little regards to civilians are no better than any other terrorist group. They are just better armed hiding behind support of big powerful nations. I would just refer them as jewish terrorist group. Both Hezbollah and Israel government should be tied up like dogs and shot up to pieces for the world to see. They do not deserve a place in the world for their disregard for precious human lives.

== Hezbollah ==

Hezbollah is the strongest force in Lebanon, and they are trying to destroy Israel.  Israel's counter-attack on Lebanon is therefore not an attack on the original Lebanese people, but is with the Hezbollah terrorists that have taken over Lebanon.
 
Funny  way to  try to  destroy a State.   Kidnapping  a   couple of  soldiers  for a  prisoner exchange, then   firing rockets  as  part  of   a military  esculation  from  both  sides  in  which    civilians are   effectively  targeted. If Hezbullah   want to destroy Israel,  then  they have a long  way to  go  befoe they are in a position to  make a serious  attempt. - Anton ([[User:210.185.17.92|210.185.17.92]] 22:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC))

== References to Cite.php ==
This article has reference both in link format and cite.php (ref) format. I find these mixed pages hard to read, and would like to convert all to one style, cite.php. I thought I was done but apparently a large section had been missing, with 30+ more links. Does anybody mind having them all converted to cite.php form? In the process of going through them, I checked a couple links. Some of the references don't seem to me to support the statements they supposedly reference. One is a reference at the end (#52 currently) about UK saying this is a terrorist organization, but the link is an EU page that had no obvious reference to UK in it. Also, references are supposed to be after punctuation per [[Wikipedia:Footnotes#Place_ref_tag_after_punctuation|MOS]]. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 01:36, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

: cite.php form sounds good to me. With so much change and vandalism, it's not surprising that some of the references should, at best, have become confused. Ref #52 [currently] is about the front/cover/alternate/sub-group names (Section 6, first paragraph) and includes the phrase &quot;Using cover names such as 'Islamic Jihad', 'The Revolutionary Justice Organization' and 'The Islamic Resistance', with the blessings of its religious leaders, Hizbullah has ... &quot;. It seems all right to me ... are we talking about the same thing? [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 15:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
:: On the part at the end giving countries listing it as a terrorist organization, it was the reference given for UK, currently #87.[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/lebanon/intro/]  All current refs should now be cite.php form, and it becomes clearer that some of the refs are identical, eg #9/#13, #36/#37 and #50/#51 jump out.

Jacoplane, one of the purposes of footnoted references is to make the source transparent and evident. Hiding a footnote behind a [45] makes it ''worse'' than an inline reference. I strongly believe that the complete URL should be visible ''unless'' a very good descriptive alt-text is provided instead. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 03:28, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

Which are being used to kill civilians in Lebanon. Iran decided that it was time to give the Hizbullah some wepons too.

The first reference, to the Forbes article, does not support the statement: in fact, it contradicts it: &quot;Saniora told the paper that &quot;the continued presence of Israeli occupation of Lebanese lands in the Chebaa Farms region is what contributes to the presence of Hezbollah weapons. The international community must help us in (getting) an Israeli withdrawal from Chebaa Farms so we can solve the problem of Hezbollah's arms,&quot; the statement said.&quot; Are there any actual citations supporting the referenced statement?

'''Hezbollah was foolhardy to instigate this crisis'''
:I'm not in favour with either side in this latest crisis and in addition,feel sad for the people who are caught up in this yet &quot; again&quot; crises in The middle east.With that said,while Hezzbollah, Hamas, ect are masters of the suicide bomb attack agaist civilians in discos and market places, they are foolish for engaging the Isreali war machine in a real war.Isreal doesn't care the Hezzbollah have their command centres in densely populated residential areas of Beruit or that the Lebonese population suffers when roads,bridges or airports are bombed into oblivion. Isreal just sees infrastructure that can and probably is used by Hezzbollah and furthermore;when has Isreal acted with restraint when attacked with crude, inaccurate weapons fired into residential areas? Hezzbollah's base of operations are amongst the Lebanonese population and it's as simple as that.Frankly,I'm mystified on what Hezzbolla hopes to achieve or expect when they fire rockets haphazardly into Isreal.
:Now one could argue for hours and days on who's the bad guy with &quot;they did that...well they did this&quot;. In the end Hezzbollah droped the ball on this one by lacking insight and for-thought into what the consequences to the Lebonese people are as a result of the first rocket attacks.Religious intoxication seems to have clouded their judgment.

Actually, it seems like racial hatred against anything Jewish has clouded their judgement.  That kidnapping was their version of crossing the Rubicon, and they are forcing all of Lebanon to reap the whirlwind of destruction they started.

== Israel is the aggessor ==

Israel has been looking for an excuse to exercise it's military right against Lebanon. IDF soldiers have made numerous excursions into Lebanon and fought with Hezbollah soldiers, though this is not readily reported in the western media. The IDF even left some kit behind [[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3279063,00.html]]. Also Hezbollah only started firing missiles into Israel after the bombing of bridges, the airport and civilian areas.
In my opinion Hezbollah is a legitimate resistance force which now provides schooling, social functions (they run the annual music festival) and legitimate buisness. This is even reported in the [[Telegraph newspaper]], or the &quot;Torygraph&quot; as it is commonly refered to. Anyone who denies this conflict was provoked ultimately by Israel, which has far superior military might, cannot see the facts which go back as far as 1982. -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 08:49, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

: Get real, Tompsci!  Hezbollah has been firing missiles at Israel ever since the Israeli withdrawl to behind the INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED border in 2000.  Just like Hamas and Islamic Jihad did after the Israelis left Gaza.  Sheeba Farms is just a flimsy pretext for Hezbollah to continue killing Israelis.  Israel simply was pushed too far after years of being pushed.  I don't call that agression.  I call that hitting back!  Hezbollah needs to be aware of consequences for its actions and I personally hope that every single stinking militant of Hezbollah's military wing is dealt with.

The Jewish state of Israel has been under fire since 1948, you remember that, Tompsci. They just want to live in co-existence with the rest of the Middle East, but is under threat after threat each day. They aren't looking for any damn excuse to fire missles at Lebannon, I'd be pissed off, as well, so don't act like this is about Lebannon, it's about Hezbollah and those cowards.

The Netherlands stays in line with EU policy and doesn't declare Hezbollah a terrorist organisation. See [http://www.minbuza.nl/default.asp?CMS_ITEM=A399D071C80C4B5995BAECF486FFC89BX3X39159X03 this document] of the Department of Foreign Affairs (in Dutch).

The EU policy isnt that simple. A Resolution of the European Parliament declares that it &quot;Considers that clear evidence exists of terrorist activities on the part of Hezbollah...&quot; look at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P6-TA-2005-0076+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN under point 8..

== References section ==

I yesterday made all the references short links, so that they would not be displayed as urls. The next step, which I had planned to do today, was to start going through the references and add the titles of the articles to the refs. However, [[User:Gimmetrow]] has gone through and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hezbollah&amp;diff=65326903&amp;oldid=65317693 removed all the links] again, in the name of &quot;link transparency&quot;.

When they were [23] [24] [45] and [68], that wasn't evident. Ultimately yes, every URL should be replaced by a descriptive link giving source, date, etc. I still fail to see why how changing them all to numbers first helps - you still have to go back to add the titles/dates. And judging by the severely messed up reference section that I just fixed, most people aren't reading them anyway.

== contradiction here ==

The current text states...
:Because that the organization initiates attacks against civilians and ideologically supports such attacks by other organizations, the United States, '''Britain''' and Israel '''consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization'''.
then in the next line says...
:The European Union does not list Hezbollah as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;,[14] but does list Imad Mugniyah,[15]
:In a non-binding resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 10 March 2005, the MEPs urged the EU Council to brand Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, the Council has so far been reluctant to do so, as France, Spain, and '''Britain''' fear that such a move would further damage the prospects for Middle East peace talks.

: I suggest that given the chaos in Lebanon in the early '80's it is quite possible that there were numerous small groups operating independently; some may have joined Hezbollah en bloc; some individual members of these groups may have joined Hezbollah later. When does the chaos end and Hezbollah begin? The 'Jewish Virtual Library' reference looks amateurish and is not adequately footnoted. I don't think it should be relied upon as a sole source even for a mere allegation. The sole source referenced for Kerr is a memoir written in 1984. If it could be substantiated with contemporary or more formal sources, I'd leave the allegation in with a note that possibly IJ and H were not the same thing (at least at that time), but otherwise I'd leave it out. As for Dodge, I'd leave it out on the grounds that there is no evidence that Hezbollah is directly responsible for all instances of terrorism committed by Shiites.

::The Jewish Virtual Library is headed by Mitchell Bard Phd who is an expert in the field of Middle-Eastern history.  He's a published author of 17 books on the subject and a walking encyclopedia.  Although preferable, sources do not have to be witnessed first hand, (i.e. no one is getting David Dodge to come in for an interview) particularly in the scope that the Internet was not created at the time these events happened.  It's perfectly plausable to use the JVL as a reference.
- nice bias research.How about how many civilians have died in lebanon because of israelis? That list is far longer. Stop killing innocent people.
: Mitchell Bard may well be a fine scholar, but the introduction to the JVL, http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/about/index.shtml, makes it quite clear that he did not author all 10,000+ articles himself. The list of allegations cited against Hezbollah is unsigned and contains no references whatsoever. The particular citation used in the main page would get a failing grade in grade 9. It may well be that Hezbollah (or those who eventually joined Hezbollah, especially since the Dodge murder occurred before Hezbollah's founding) had something to do with it. If there is, then fine. Start a whole new section on it! Section 357! But at this point, anyway, I haven't seen anything that would justify such a claim. [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 05:54, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

I like the conversation.  What proof do you have that Israel killed 400 civilians and not terrorists?  Don't point me to random images of suffering children, those could've been taken anywhere by anyone with bias.  Honestly, I'm sure lots civilians got killed, I'm just using your rediculous argument that a biased source is not necessarily telling a fact, and just because there are 40 million journalists in Lebanon reporting this conflict with the ease and use of the internet, does not erase smaller terrorist acts that got almost no coverage from the history of the conflict, which you and I both know, and whether it is justified by your sources or not, is Jihadism against Jews.

== &quot;Total War&quot;? ==

According to the Wikipedia reference for [[total war]], ''The most identifiable consequence of total war in modern times has been the inclusion of civilians and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying a country's ability to engage in war. The targeting of civilians developed from two distinct theories. The first theory was that if enough civilians were killed, factories could not function. The second theory was that if civilians were killed, the country would be so demoralized that it would have no ability to wage further war.  Total war also resulted in the mobilization of the home front. Propaganda became a required component of total war in order to boost production and maintain morale. Rationing took place to provide more material for waging war''.  
With this in mind, Hezbollah's targeting of civilian cities with rockets in this most recent conflict, and Israel's targeting of the infrastructure of Lebanon meets this criteria.  The term 'total war' is not being used though in the media...  [[User:Expatkiwi]] [[image:No-hez-flag.gif|25px]]

== Ideology section ==

With regards to - 

&quot;Hezbollah supports the destruction of the state of Israel[65] and has co-operated with other militant Islamic organizations such as Hamas in order to promote this goal.&quot;

I feel the source given for such a direct statement is too old, especially as it was from a time when Israel were occupying Lebanon. I couldn't find a newer source for this other than opinion.

Unless a newer source can be provided maybe something like...

&quot;Hezbollah leaders have, in the past, suggested that the destruction of Israel is the only way peace can be obtained in the Middle East and have co-operated with other militant Islamic organizations such as Hamas&quot;

I think this matches the actual quote in the source a lot better as well.

No doubt someone can write it better than me but what does anyone think?

Cheers, Andy

:I haven't found anything too definitive yet on Hezbollah's official policy towards Israel. The Hezbollah documents I have found simply talk of &quot;resistance to&quot; rather than &quot;destruction of&quot;.

'''''Hezbollah''' ({{lang-ar|حزب الله}}&lt;ref&gt;The name {{lang|ar|حزب الله}}, which has its stress on the final syllable, is transliterated from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in a number of ways.

Whether they support Israel today is subject to question.  To the Western media, Maronites have generally shown a negative response, but it's difficult to asertain their true beliefs as Hezbollah imprisons those considered collaborators or spies, as published on their official website: (Scroll through updates) -&gt;[http://www.ghaliboun.net/eindex.php](Direct) -&gt;[[http://www.ghaliboun.net/enewsdetails.php?id=568]] [[User:Labaneh|Labaneh]] 17:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

24/07/2006 Hezbollah's Official Webpage Sites Achmenijahd calling Israel to Leave the Middle East [http://www.ghaliboun.net/enewsdetails.php?id=341]

It's an AFP article...[[User:Bertilvidet|Bertilvidet]] 20:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

Regardless of whose article it is, it is posted on the official Hezbollah website. [[User:Labaneh|Labaneh]] 15:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, but what is the point concerning the wikipedia article? [[User:Bertilvidet|Bertilvidet]] 17:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Here's an interview from Al-Arabiya TV (Dubai) Interview of - 5/4/2006 [http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=214&amp;ar=1132wmv&amp;ak=null Former Hizbullah Secretary-General Subhi Al-Tufeili] Hizbollah definitely fosters it's relations with the Syrians, but Hezbollah's real leadership is 'the rule of the jurisprudence'.  In other words, Khamenei (Iranians).&lt;ref&gt; memri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, notice in this speech to Hezbollah who's picture is hanging in the background. [http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=214&amp;ar=074wmv&amp;ak=null It's Iran's Khamenei.] &lt;ref&gt; memri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has admitted this week of Supplying Hezbollah with Fajr5 and ZelZal Missiles.

==strategy not idealogy==
Please lokk at this text which is written in idealogy part:
:''...before us lies an exceptional and historic chance to exterminate this complete Zionist project which has been threatening our nation and region for over fifty years now. We as a nation must not waste this great chance... The continuation of the combating Palestinian resistance deprives the Zionists of security, or even the reason for their existence on this land... Their only correct choice, or in other words their only inescapable destiny is to pack their baggage, leave Palestine, and go back to where they came from.&quot;[68]'' 

As you know idealogy doesn't reffer to the definite time, place or event. But this text reffers to difinite event.--[[User:Sa.vakilian|Sa.vakilian]] 04:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: I sort-of agree with you! But ideology influences what one would think of such an event and it is clear that Nasrullah thinks that this would be a very good idea. From what I've read, I've received the definite impression that while Hezbollah recognizes that they can (to phrase things most diplomatically) only be a guerrilla nuisance to Israel as things currently stand, they would love to be able to 'exterminate this complete Zionist project'. I suggest the quotation be kept until such time as a more definite statement can be found directly from Hezbollah in words confirmed by deeds. [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 04:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

What do others think of this question? [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 16:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

By Nasrallah's speeches, it's clear that he envisions a Palestine where Israel is now.  This is definitely part of ideology, I would venture to say dogma.  Furthermore, due to the unstable state of Hezbollah, would it be possible to store their official speeches on a different more stable media?[[User:Labaneh|Labaneh]] 17:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

I have added a movie link to an important movie on the subject of Islamic Fundamentalism - it has several speaches in it with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasralla calling for the Destruction of Israel and the US as well as Global Jihad, and also shows thousands of his followers making a heil Hitler arm motions calling out &quot;Death to the Jews&quot;.  I welcome any documentary about Lebanese struggles but this film is a must see to understand Israel's preemptive attacks.[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6162397493278181614&amp;q=Obsession%3A+What+The+War+on+Terror+Is+Really+About&amp;hl=en][[User:Labaneh|Labaneh]] 02:06, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

==Merge the &quot;Statements by Hezbollah&quot;==
I think this part make many problems and everybody wants to add something . I propose to merge it to relative parts. --[[User:Sa.vakilian|Sa.vakilian]] 06:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: How do you propose to do this - which quote goes where? Would it be a good idea to collect anti-Israel quotations in a subheading under &quot;Ideology&quot;? To me, that makes sense. [[User:JiHymas@himivest.com|JiHymas@himivest.com]] 16:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

::JiHymas - do you really mean this? &quot; '''Would it be a good idea to collect anti-Israel quotations in a subheading under &quot;Ideology&quot;? To me, that makes sense.''' 

:I hope that I am not acting out of line but I have removed the first two alleged 'statements' because they are taken directly from the american right wing publication The national review, and are represented there without any reference to where or when they were said. In addition to this the statements which cannot be verified (other than by further references in the american right wing press) are extremely inflamatory. Should they have actually been made - It should be possible to cite more fully when and where they were said - If not all that will be achieved is furthering hatred. [[User:DavidParfitt|DavidP]] 04:04, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

::If those shouldn't be mentioned, then nothing at all should be mentioned. Having just pro-Hezbollah quotes as it is now is extremely POV. /[[User:Slarre|Slarre]] 04:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

:: DavidParfitt : Sure, I meant it. Why wouldn't I mean it? The idea that Hezbollah is virulently anti-Israel is not just an idea that got made up by nefarious right wing publications. Have a look on this page at the &quot;Strategy &amp; Ideology&quot; section ... that quote was taken from the text of a speech published on Hezbollah's website. Does that meet your criteria for verification and context? I looked up the first deleted National Review citation and found:
:::On October 22, 2002, Hassan Nasrallah told Lebanon’s Daily Star, “If they [the Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them world wide.”
::I would prefer more direct citations, but the Daily Star is a pay site and not suitable for linking here. This citation is as good as most newspaper/journal citations, and should be kept (somewhere!) until something better, or something contradictory, is found. Let's be fair - let's recognize that Hezbollah is a complex shadow-government, as complex as any other major organization. Sure. But let's not whitewash them, either. Whitewashing is, as '''Slarre''' points out, extremely POV.

== specific references to Hez as Terrorist ==

I have just clarified the position of the UK, Australia and The Netherlands with regard to the status of Hezbollah as a terrorist org.
It seems that it is easy to label anything terrorist these days, and one should be careful in doing so. 
Thinking it strange that the UK was listed as a country that 'branded' Hezbollah as terrorist, yet a few lines later was one of the nations reluctant for the EU to do the same - so I decided to read the citations.
These three countries have made a distinction between Hezbollah proper and its external security organisation (ESO). furthermore the UK has only banned the ESO from operating in the UK. This distinction may be a fine one, but it is what enables the UK to recognise the legitimate elected lebanese Hezbollah MPs and exert pressure on the EU not to label Hezbollah as terrorist.
To state that there is some kind of blanket condemnation on the part of these countries, wether true or not, should only be made with some direct evidence. simply generalising the situation to give a false impression really doesn't help anybody to understand the complexity of the issues.

Unfortunately, I can't quite make out the word.  They're trying to reestablish the calibat?  The talibat?  Neither seem to return many relavent hits on Google.  Any ideas?

::Hezbollah are Shiite and they believe in [[velayate faghih]] like Iran so they don't want to make Caliphate like Ottoman. Although they don't want to make religious government in Lebanon because Lebanon is formed from some different religious minority.--[[User:Sa.vakilian|Sa.vakilian]] 13:25, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

== Russian viewpoint ==

http://seattlepi.com/national/1103AP_Russia_Terrorist_Organizations.html - Hezbollah not on Russia's terrorist list.

What's more: ''Lavrov said that Russia's support for a Hezbollah role in decision-making in the Mideast crisis was shared by European countries and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan''. -G3, 13:39, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

: This sounds logical. Agree with JiHymas as well on the Origins. Created [[History of Hezbollah]]. I think a nicely written summary is needed on it, as well as a new write for the History section on this page. [[User:Mceder|Mceder]] 16:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

:: So I am impatient and went ahead and did it. Feel free to revert if it is not correct, but the article sure looks better now...

== Ideology Recapped ==

I still want someone to explain to me why calling for the Death of America and Israel is not a part of ideology?  Put it in context put it in quotes, You can't deny it's a major part of their rhetoric, it must be a part of ideology.
