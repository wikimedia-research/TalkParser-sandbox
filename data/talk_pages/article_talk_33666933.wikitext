== December 2011 ==

Regarding [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erin_Burnett&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=467957453 this edit] you made to the [[Erin Burnett]]  article: you removed content from Wikipedia without providing an explanation in an [[WP:ES|edit summary]] or on the article's [[WP:TP|talk page]]. Moreover, your edit was marked as a [[WP:MINOR|minor edit]]. Minor edits are grammar/spelling corrections, reverting '''obvious''' vandalism and things like that. Removal of content that isn't obvious vandalism is rarely (if ever) a minor edit.

I understand that, if you're new to Wikipedia, all the policies and jargon may seem overwhelming at first. Hopefully, the links in the paragraph above are helpful to you and if you have any remaining questions, feel free to ask. Regards, --&lt;span style=&quot;padding:2px;border:1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#6bb5d6;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Skysmurf|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Skysmurf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Skysmurf|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;(Talk)&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:08, 27 December 2011 (UTC)
