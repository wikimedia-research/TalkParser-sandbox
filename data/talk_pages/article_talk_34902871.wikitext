==Welcome==
Hello, Kamalbenslama, and '''[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome to Wikipedia]]'''! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Kamalbenslama|your contributions]].

I notice that one of the first articles you created was [[:Kamal benslama]], which appears to be an article [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|about yourself]]. This is a [[Wikipedia:Avoiding common mistakes|common mistake]] made by new [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]]—as this is an encyclopedia, we wouldn't expect to have an article about every contributor. Your [[Help:User page|user page]], however, is a great place to write about yourself, making sure to stay within [[Wikipedia:User page|user page guidelines]]. Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit it normally.

The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|anyone from this list]] and they will copy it to your user page.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;''' on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
*[[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Where to ask a question]] or ask me on [[user talk:Guillaume2303|my talk page]]. Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:Welcome-auto --&gt;

== February 2012 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not write an article about  yourself, as you did at [[:Kamal Benslama]]. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]] is ''strongly'' discouraged – see our guideline on [[WP:AUTOBIO|writing  autobiographies]]. If you create such an article, it may be deleted. If what you have done in life is genuinely notable and can be verified according to our policy for [[WP:PEOPLE|articles about living  people]], someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]]). Please understand that this is an encyclopedia and not a personal web space or social networking site. If your article has already been deleted, please see: [[Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?|Why was my page deleted?]], and if you feel the deletion was an error, please discuss it with the deleting administrator. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 18:55, 27 February 2012 (UTC)
== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Kamal Benslama]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Kamal Benslama]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''No evidence of notability, does not meet [[WP:PROF]]. Citation and publication data appear very high. This is deceptive, however: subject is first nor last author on any of the important ones, which have sometimes over 3000 (three-thousand!) authors.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Kamal Benslama|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. In particular, the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Guillaume2303|Guillaume2303]] ([[User talk:Guillaume2303|talk]]) 19:04, 27 February 2012 (UTC)
== Nomination of [[Kamal Benslama]] for deletion ==

&lt;div class=&quot;floatleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot;&gt;[[File:Ambox warning orange.svg|42px|alt=|link=]]&lt;/div&gt;A discussion is taking place as to whether the article '''[[Kamal Benslama]]''' is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia according to [[Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] or whether it should be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]].

The article will be discussed at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kamal Benslama ]] until a consensus is reached, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. The nomination will explain the policies and guidelines which are of concern. The discussion focuses on good quality evidence, and our policies and guidelines.

Users may edit the article during the discussion, including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion.  However, do not remove the article-for-deletion template from the top of the article. [[User:Guillaume2303|Guillaume2303]] ([[User talk:Guillaume2303|talk]]) 19:37, 27 February 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but your recent edit removed maintenance templates from [[:Kamal Benslama]].
