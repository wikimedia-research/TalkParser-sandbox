Corrected the use of terms such as &quot;dojo&quot; and &quot;sensei&quot; when discussing Laimon's Cobra Kai gym in Vegas.

Is this page written in a standard Wikipedia style?  It reads somewhat unlike most others.

==Mistakes?==

Is it really the place of an encyclopedia to point out continuity errors in the film?  Especially somewhat irrelevant ones (i.e. the direction of the radio during the fight scene?) Probably more at home on IMDB than here

I liked the &quot;errors&quot; section.  Yea, it's a classic, but it's also interesting to hear about stuff that you don't normally hear about every day.  [[User:207.157.121.50|207.157.121.50]] 07:04, 20 October 2005 (UTC)mightyafrowhitey

== R.I.P. Morita ==

A sad day for 80s movie fans:

'''''From IMDB.com:'''''

''The Karate Kid star Pat Morita has died at his Las Vegas home. He was 73. The actor and comedian, whose portrayal of Mr. Miyagi in the 1984 movie earned him an Oscar nomination, passed away on Thursday of natural causes, according to his wife of 12 years Evelyn. She says in a statement, &quot;(My husband) dedicated his entire life to acting and comedy.&quot; For years, the actor, real name Noriyuki Morita, played small roles in such films as Thoroughly Modern Millie and TV series such as The Odd Couple and Green Acres. His first breakthrough came with classic TV show Happy Days, and he followed with his own brief series Mr. T and Tina. The Karate Kid spawned three sequels ending with 1994's The Next Karate Kid, which paired him with a young Hilary Swank. More recently, Morita provided the voice for a character in the 1998 Disney movie Mulan. Born in northern California on June 28, 1932 to migrant fruit pickers, Morita spent most of his early years in the hospital with spinal tuberculosis. He later recovered only to be sent to a Japanese-American internment camp in Arizona during World War II. After the war, Morita's family tried to repair their finances by running a Sacramento restaurant. It was there that Morita first showed an interest in a showbusiness career, eventually committing to it full time at the age of 30. He is survived by his wife and three daughters from a previous marriage.''

Farewell, Morita; you and your portrayal of a gruff but kind-mannered sensei will live on in our hearts. --[[User:Toiletduck|The Trashman]] 19:53, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

== Death of Mr Miyagi? ==

:Goju ryu is probably the closest [[User:Thedarxide|Thedarxide]] 14:26, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

::I would agree on Goju Ryu as well. Considering the fact that Mr. Miyagi's last name is Miyagi. And the founder of Okinawan Goju Ryu is Chojun Miyagi. It could be just an incredible conceidence, but it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to use the name Miyagi as an homage.
::[[User:Rayghost|Rayghost]] ([[User talk:Rayghost|talk]]) 02:40, 5 May 2008 (UTC)
::I don't have an official source but I've always been told they were actually using either kung fu (not sure what style) or tai kwon do because whilst karate was the most well know martial art at the time the director/studio didn't think it looked exciting enough. [[User:Danikat|Danikat]] ([[User talk:Danikat|talk]]) 19:59, 20 April 2012 (UTC)
::I concur that it was at least as much Goju-ryu as anything else. I studied that style back in college (in nineteen mumble-mumble), and many of the moves Mr. Miyagi teaches him are indistinguishable from Goju-ryu ones; particularly the &quot;paint-a-fence.&quot; That said, I did not see the Crane stance that Daniel used during my training, but that may be because I only got as far as a green belt; who knows?
::I have not found any [[WP:RS|source]] that indicates the style used, and I'm apparently not alone in that, since the article doesn't actually say.

==Medal of Honor?==
The article states that Miyagi won the Medal of Honor.  In the film, when Daniel finds the medal and holds it up and looks at it, he looks at it and reads the word &quot;valor&quot;.  I don't know much about military medals, but if it says &quot;valor&quot; on it, doesn't that mean it is the Medal of Valor?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/174.124.108.224|174.124.108.224]] ([[User talk:174.124.108.224|talk]]) 21:51, 24 December 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

:Good question, but there are many military medals given out for valor and if you goto the [[Medal of Honor]] page you will see that the medal itself in some of its forms had the word &quot;valor&quot; on it.

::‎I have to disagree. There is no such Army award named &quot;Medal of Valor&quot; and its capitalization denotes a proper noun. The medal depicted in this movie's scene is specifically the Medal of Honor. While there are various military awards given for valor, such as the Bronze Star, Silver Star, and Distinguished Service Cross, [http://www.medalsofamerica.com/content--name-Army-Medals-and-Ribbons-Chart as illustrated here]‎, only the nation's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, has the word &quot;Valor&quot; inscribed thereon. So I've changed the wording accordingly, with a wikilink. In so doing, this article will also be consistent with [[Kesuke Miyagi‎#World War II military service|this section]] of Miyagi's fictional bio. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:JGHowes|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;background:#008000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;JGHowes&amp;nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JGHowes|''talk'']]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 15:49, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

[[:The Karate Kid (1984 film)]] → {{no redirect|The Karate Kid}} – [[The Karate Kid]] has redirected to [[The Karate Kid (1984 film)]] since last September, so we are already treating this film as the primary topic. If the consensus is that the film should be treated as the primary topic, then we should make this move. My opinion on the matter is that while the 2010 remake gets similar traffic to the 1984 film, the original film is still primary in terms of long-term significance, per [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]. Reviewing results in Google Books, this film is constantly referenced, reflect its &quot;greater enduring notability and educational value&quot;. For example, the book ''Rebels and Chicks: A History of the Hollywood Teen Movie'' writes about its box office success as continuing &quot;the sports cycle of teen films&quot; in the 1980s, and it compares the film to ''Rocky'' in having underdog protagonists and championship matches. Other results discuss it in the context of martial arts films or of 1980s films.

*A similar setup is [[The Day the Earth Stood Still]] vs. its remake at [[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)]]. While the 2008 film is popular, it has not demonstrated the long-term significance that the 1951 film has. Admittedly, this is a more obvious conclusion to draw since ''The Karate Kid'' is not as intensely studied as ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'', but it shows that the original film can be a primary topic over the remake if it has that long-term significance. Examples of original films and remakes both being disambiguated due to no real significance are [[The Crazies]] and [[Death at a Funeral]], but I do not think that setup is warranted here.

*'''Strong support'''. The primary topic in this case is either the initial film or the franchise as a whole (other meanings are relatively inconsequential), and the original work should generally get the spot until it is clearly shown to be superseded, as when the original is not particularly notable but later installments make the series notable. This is the opposite case, where the original remains by far the most important film of the series, more important than all others combined.

*'''Support''' PRIMARYTOPIC due to long-term significance, as mentioned. Given it's just a move over redirect this doesn't seem like a controversial move.
