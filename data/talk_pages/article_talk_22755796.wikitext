::This article submission lacks any independant, secondary sources about the subject.  The one article listed talks about the production, but does not mention the actor.  In order for a biographical article to be accepted by Wikipedia, the subject's notability must be established in accordance with the [[WP:BIO]] policy.  I've placed the article on hold for now pending improvements.  Thanks..  --[[User:SharkxFanSJ|SharkxFanSJ]] ([[User talk:SharkxFanSJ|talk]]) 21:53, 10 May 2009 (UTC)
