== Comedy (stand-up &amp; other live comedy performance) missing ==

Not sure how it should be added, but I believe it's of great cultural importance. (Possible subsections: Live stand-up circuit, Festivals that feature comedy, Theatre Sports, etc etc)--[[User:Tyranny Sue|Tyranny Sue]] ([[User talk:Tyranny Sue|talk]]) 05:46, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

== Significant Australian performing arts organisations box ==

The layout is fairly awkward-looking as it is, with all those state columns. Perhaps breaking it down into state subheadings, each with its own box, would be better.
And perhaps include some festivals? (e.g. MICF, Adelaide Fringe, etc) --[[User:Tyranny Sue|Tyranny Sue]] ([[User talk:Tyranny Sue|talk]]) 05:58, 5 April 2009 (UTC)
