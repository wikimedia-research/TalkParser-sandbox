[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Sandro Ranieri Guimarães Cordeiro]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' by [[User:ClueBot|ClueBot]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* Cluebot produces very few [[false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot/FalsePositives|report it here]], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again. 
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Sandro Ranieri Guimarães Cordeiro]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sandro+Ranieri+Guimar%C3%A3es+Cordeiro&amp;diff=351626995&amp;oldid=351600969 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/188.221.129.72|188.221.129.72]] [[User:188.221.129.72|(u)]] [[User talk:188.221.129.72|(t)]] making a minor change with obscenities on 2010-03-23T20:14:50+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 572954 --&gt;.

Please review the guidelines at [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] and take this opportunity to add references to the article.

== Edit summaries ==

Dear User 188.221.129.72.  Perhaps you are unaware it is customary and requested practice at Wikipedia to add an [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]] when you make a change to a Wikipedia page.  It's obvious from a material review of your contributions you are a conscientious user; however, that is impossible to tell when one only sees a bare IP address and no edit summary - usual telltales either of an inexperienced user or vandalism.  Please help us all out by providing brief edit summaries (as you occasionally do) for all your edits.  It would save much effort consumed verifying you are in fact a capable good faith editor. Yours. [[User:Wikiuser100|Wikiuser100]] ([[User talk:Wikiuser100|talk]]) 11:05, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
