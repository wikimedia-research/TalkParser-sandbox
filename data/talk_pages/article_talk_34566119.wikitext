[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Buenos Aires]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' (undone) by an [[automated]] [[computer program]] called [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG makes very few [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|mistakes]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been considered as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG#Information About False Positives|read about it]], [{{User:ClueBot NG/Warnings/FPReport|853181}} report it here], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
*'''If you need help''', please see our '''[[Help:Contents|help pages]]''', and if you can't find what you are looking for there, please feel free to place &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on [[Special:MyTalk|your talk page]] and someone will drop by to help.
