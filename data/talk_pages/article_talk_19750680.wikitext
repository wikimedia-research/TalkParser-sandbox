== IVANA KOTOV DELETION ==


With all the respect, the reason to delete Ivana Kotov is very non pro and ignorant.&lt;br /&gt;
Ivana Kotov is a very important name in Serbian music education, serbian culture development, and due to her achievements to graduate from an USA college on a unique scholarship, as the 1st and only serbian vocalist ever, Ivana has been rolemodel for thousands of serbian kids pursuing music schools in Serbia. We are a small country on the Balcans, and for development of our music culture, names like Ivana Kotov are very important and rare. There were 3 people working on this article, and we would like to have a brief explanation, and right to have our article back. Ivana Kotov does not need any kind of advertising, her name simply belongs in the encyclopedia.
Looking forward to hear from you. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
