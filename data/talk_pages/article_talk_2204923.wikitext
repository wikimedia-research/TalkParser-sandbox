==Named Expresses==
Some '''named expresses''' I can think of are:

* '''Devonian''', which ran from Bradford (I think) to Bristol (and not to Devon!)
** See [http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r087.html this article] where there is a splendid photo of a train on this service - and it was from Bradford, and it '''did''' run to Devon (seems little point in calling it the Devonian otherwise) [[User:Peter Shearan|Peter Shearan]] 13:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
* '''Palatine''' mentioned under [[Midland Main Line]]
* '''Peaks''' ditto
* '''Thames-Clyde Express'''. I'm not sure if this was named in LMS days. I believe it ran down the Erewash valley rather than through Derby
** It certainly was! I have Alan Anderson's book (undated) which sets out the whole journey: St Pancras-Leicester-Sheffiel-Leeds-Settle-Carlisle-Glasgow St Enoch, 427 miles (683km in new money!)[[User:Peter Shearan|Peter Shearan]] 13:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
* '''Pines'''. This ran from Bournemouth on the old LSWR lines to Bath Green Park and joined the northbound LMS from Bristol at Mangotsfield. It went on through Birmingham to Manchester.
* '''Master Cutler''' I'm not sure if this was an LMS express, but a BR one


Perhaps someone would like to carry this on

The '''Master Cutler''' ran on the Great Central Railway, which became part of the LNER, not LMS. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Tivedshambo|Tivedshambo]] ([[User Talk:Tivedshambo|talk]]) 17:13, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
: The Master Cutler was a GN and GC joint Pullman that ran from Sheffield Victoria to London Kings Cross via Retford.  It only moved to ex-LMS metals after the run down of services from Sheffield Victoria in the 1960s.  Also, the Pines was one of those trains that used to split repeatedly - during winter months it had portions that went to Leeds, Bradford (split at Birmingham and again at Sheffield) and Manchester, Liverpool (split at Crewe).  During the summer they ran as completely separate trains due to the extra demand with the Pines being the Manchester train.  [[User:BaseTurnComplete|BaseTurnComplete]] 10:16, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

There is the present day '''Master Cutler''' also the '''Robin Hood''' and the '''Midland Express''' run by [[Midland Mainline]] [[User:Chevin|Chevin]] 09:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

I think the Devonian ran to Paignton in the Summer. Certainly there were many &quot;Summer Specials&quot;.

The '''Pines''' had a long and varied history. In 1958-9 I used to catch it at Bath Green Park and change to the Devonian at Gloucester for Derby. The only things that stayed the same were that it started in Bournemouth and ended at Manchester. There is a book about it Austin, S., (1998) ''Portrait of the Pines Express,'' Ian Allan Publishing.[[User:Chevin|Chevin]] 17:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

There was also the '''Waverley''' which I believe ran from London via Corby and Manton Junction to Nottingham and Edinburgh. [[User:Chevin|Chevin]] 09:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC) 

There was a '''Thames-Forth''' express too, like the Clyde but to Edinburgh.  I have a feeling that this went via Nottingham too.[[User:BaseTurnComplete|BaseTurnComplete]] 16:12, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
==Named trains (not just expresses?)==
If you look at [http://www.joyce.whitchurch.btinternet.co.uk/namers.htm this article] you will find a huge quantity of them. They cover all the railways of course, but this is better than trying to use one's memory ... [[User:Peter Shearan|Peter Shearan]] 13:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

::Try '''[[:Category:Named passenger trains of the United Kingdom]]'''...  [[User:EdJogg|EdJogg]] 21:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)



Yes, C J Allen produced a book called Titled Trains of Great Britain. It's referred to on the cross referenced page. Further information though follows.

The Thames Forth was named in 1927, but the name was never used after the war. The Waverley was the BR version. Both ran via the Waverley route north of Carlisle. They normally went via Nottingham and Trowell, rather than Leicester and Trent, but this was never something that was invariably consistent from one timetable to another, or even necessarily between up and down versions of the same working.

The West Coast mainline had quite a few named trains on it. I don't think the LNWR had any official names. Most names date from the LMS or BR periods. Apart from the Royal Scot, there was the Mid Day Scot, known unofficially by the LNWR as the Corridor, the Coronation Scot (streamlined), a Night Scot, the Irish Mail, the Comet, the Lakes Express the Merseyside Express etc etc. Post war the Coronation Scot was never reintroduced. For one thing, the LMS streamliners had their streamlining removed in the 1940s.  However in the late 1950s before work started on electrification and everything slowed down, there was a flyer called the Caledonian worked by a Duchess with a limited rake of coaches. 

There were also Club trains from Manchester, and named trains in Scotland, including at one time an Orcadian on the Far North line.

The Peak Express only existed before 1939. The Palatine was reintroduced in the 1950s, but applied to different workings. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was also a Midland Pullman, a sort of precursor of an HST that ran between St Pancras and Manchester. The set also did an intermediate run from St Pancras to Nottingham and back.

The Devonian ran for at least part of the year as far as Paignton which is in Devon.

==London Midland?==
Someone has added a note under the heading &quot;Resurrection&quot; suggesting the new company London Midland is a reincarnation of the LMS. I hardly think so but do others agree? [[User:Chevin|Chevin]] ([[User talk:Chevin|talk]]) 17:48, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
: Yes I agree with you. The LMS was an integrated railway that owned the track, stations, trains and staff. LM is merely a franchise to run train services. Perhaps the title should be '''Reuse of the name London Midland''' - if the text is considered worthy to remain.[[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]] ([[User talk:Pyrotec|talk]]) 17:56, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Well yes, but, even then, it it's only a small part of the LMS.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chevin|Chevin]] ([[User talk:Chevin|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chevin|contribs]]) 09:25, 19 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I entirely agree. &quot;London Midland&quot; has as much connection with the original LMS, or for that matter its constituents, as Great Western Radio, the Swindon and Wiltshire station, has with the real GWR.

== Discussion on format and push for GA status ==

Please note that there is an ongoing discussion on this article and articles on the other &quot;Big Four&quot; pre-nationalisation companies [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_UK_Railways#Goals_-_.27Big_Four.27_articles|here]].

:Well it has been a while since I posted the note above, and after a period away from Wikipedia I have returned and started work on re-formatting the article to permit future expansion through additional information and sub-sections.  I have noted some recent editing activity on the page and have kept the information added by other editors (although I have in some instances moved it into sections I consider provide more appropriate homes).  I welcome comments on what I have done so far, and any suggestions for future areas of research and ways in which the article could be developed, with the ultimate aim of achieving GA status. [[User:ColourSarge|ColourSarge]] ([[User talk:ColourSarge|talk]]) 02:05, 18 November 2008 (UTC)

::'''Update.''' So far I have put around 30 hours editing into updating and expanding several sections of the article, particularly formation, electrification, shipping and construction.  Work has also gone into most other sub-sections of the article.  I am currently in the process of a thorough re-write of the railway operations section, splitting this into passenger, freight and other operations, and hope to complete this within the next day or so. This will then be followed by further work on the sections dealing with non-railway interests and another pass over the traction and rolling stock section.  Wanting to balance re-writing the whole article myself (together with whatever flaws and foibles accompany my particular editing style and experience) against my current motivation for editing the article, I have left a couple of days where I have undertaken only minor touch-ups, while waiting to see if there are any other editors out there working to push the article forwards.  So far there doesn't seem to be anyone else doing any major work on the article, so I intend to carry on as outlined above.

::If anyone has any comments on the work done so far I would love to hear them, as they may help me shape my editing of the article going forwards, both in terms of style and also content - I am keen to ensure the article retains balance and covers all relevant topics.  So.....any feedback?  [[User:ColourSarge|ColourSarge]] ([[User talk:ColourSarge|talk]]) 23:28, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Your efforts are not going un-noticed -- the number and size of edits has made me leave you to get on with it!! It is a huge subject, so getting the structure right will take time.

:::: Thanks [[User:EdJogg|EdJogg]], nice to know someone is noticing.  I have to admit I have thought the same about the shipping (and maybe the construction bit) and would probably look to split out to sub-articles eventually. Was undecided whether Electrification would be better under Railway operations or Traction and Rolling Stock.  Maybe I'll create a new section along the lines of &quot;Technology&quot; or &quot;Innovation&quot; and put it in there along with 10000 &amp; 10001, turbomotives etc.....

Resetting the indent.  OK, good idea about making the tables collapsible - not sure how to do this though - have taken a look at the table in the article you cite and it appears this is a format specifically for Points of Interest, with fixed headers.  If I get the chance I will try to find the template and see if I can replicate something similar for this article - unless there is an easier way to do this that I have missed?

:Further to the above I have this evening undertaken a major re-write of the &quot;Railway Operations&quot; section, plus a lesser re-write of the &quot;Hotels&quot; sub-section.  I have also created two new, related &quot;List&quot; articles.  One removes the table of [[List of Shipping facilities of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway|shipping]] facilities mentioned above, while the other lists the [[List of Hotels of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway|hotels]] operated by the LMS.

== Further reference material for future use ==

I invite anyone to put details of potential reference sources here, to be used in the future push for GA status for this article.

For my part I have come across this [http://www.lmsr.co.uk/index.htm] very entertaining site, which seems to have numerous links to other related sites.  Not sure if the actual site linked to there is admissable though as it is an amateur reconstruction of what the LMS website ''might'' have looked like had the internet been around in the 1930s!  Certainly an interesting thought! [[User:ColourSarge|ColourSarge]] ([[User talk:ColourSarge|talk]]) 00:53, 17 May 2008 (UTC)

== Derry/Londonderry re LMS ==

Watchers of this page will have noticed a torrent of reversions between [[Derry]] and [[Londonderry]] by a number of editors interested in editing Ireland-related articles. There seems to be some history of edit-warring among these editors, so the submit comment regarding 'wikistalking' is actually not far off the mark.

The problem, as far as I can make out, is that 'Derry' is the preferred term according to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles)]] (WP:IMOS), but historically the LMS would have served 'Londonderry', since that was the official name at the time.

My proposal (with no axe to grind except to limit the number of edits appearing on this page) is that we should use the ''historical'' term in this case, in the same way that we would most likely use the historical name of a station that was later renamed under BR.

[[User:EdJogg|EdJogg]] ([[User talk:EdJogg|talk]]) 14:50, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

:Your proposal sounds good, although I'd be happier if we had that historical-use precedent written down somewhere as a guideline, perhaps in a relevant WikiProject if not the MoS. Otherwise we've little to point to, and may be seen as taking sides. Have we such a guideline? &amp;ndash; [[User:kierant|&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Kieran T&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;''(''[[User talk:kierant|''&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;'']]'')''&lt;/sup&gt; 14:54, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

::(e/c)As this is an almost insignificant part of the page, (it's covered by a separate article), can we get rid of the problem by changing the wording to ...''The LMS was also the only one of the Big Four companies to operate rail services in Northern Ireland, serving most major settlements in the province''?&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;[[User:Tivedshambo|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#7F0000;color:#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;Tivedshambo&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;([[User Talk:Tivedshambo|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/Tivedshambo|c]])&amp;nbsp;(logged on as [[User:Pek the Penguin|Pek]])&lt;/sub&gt; 14:57, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

After quite an intense period of editing this article, I have spent a few days away from it to encourage others to comment or edit as they wish, or to comment on what I have done.

(undent) OK I've been doing some work on referencing material this evening.  In particular some of the following sections / sub sections: Infobox, Joint Lines, Scheduled services (last para), Notable people.

There is clearly a lot more work to do on this, which I will work through as and when I can referencing from the source I have been using, before I add any &quot;new&quot; content.  There will also be some cleanup as the same source is quoted a couple of different ways in the Source list, but I will probably try to do this cleanup after my first pass through referencing so that nothing goes unreferenced for the time being.

== LMS Logo ==

I have for some time considered that an image of the LMS logo would be more appropriate in this article's infobox than the current image of the emblem carved into stonework.  I know an image of the LMS logo appears on the homepage of the [[http://www.freewebs.com/lmsforum/|LMS Forum]], but after having spent an hour traweling through various help pages on licensing and uploading images, I am still not sure whether it would qualify as public domain or fair use - uploading images is typically an area that I steer clear of.

== Need to re-name article? ==

During my work on the article I have come across a statement which seems to indicate that the article needs to be renamed.  The section below is an extract from p135 of Whitehouse &amp; Thomas (2002) as referenced in the article:

:''&quot;Publicity played a vital - but ever changing - role in the life of the LMS.  And note that it was LMS as distinct from L.N.E.R., indeed the only one of the Big Four not to put full stops between its initials, a distinction carefully followed even when the four took joint ads. (But there was not always consistency in the use of the initials or the company's full name, London Midland and Scottish Railway, still with no punctuation.)&quot;''

This would suggest to me that the article name should be ''London Midland and Scottish Railway'' i.e. without the comma after London. [[User:ColourSarge|ColourSarge]] ([[User talk:ColourSarge|talk]]) 13:14, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

::Hmmm. Trouble is that it goes against the generally accepted rules of grammar, and forever after you will have editors (like me) seeing the missing comma and wanting to come here and &quot;correct&quot; the name of the article! The same problem exists with the [[Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal]], where the official name (as reflected by the associated preservation group) has no comma after Manchester, but the comma may be equally present or absent in current and historical texts depending on whether a well-meaning copy-editor has 'corrected' it or not! (And it still looks wrong to me: where is &quot;Manchester Bolton&quot;, anyway?) However the LMS may well have been intended as the &quot;''London&amp;ndash;Midland'' and Scottish Railway&quot;, rather than the &quot;London &lt;pause&gt;, Midland and Scottish Railway&quot;, maybe?? I dunno -- verging dangerously into [[WP:OR|OR]] territory here!

:::You make very fair points Ed, and I'm not convinced either, all through my recent editing activity here I have been adding the comma, and after recent involvement in another, largely semantic, series of discussions over Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty etc, I am inclined to agree we should leave where it is, unless some compelling evidence comes along to the contrary.  Your idea of mentioning it within the article is a good one though. [[User:ColourSarge|ColourSarge]] ([[User talk:ColourSarge|talk]]) 19:09, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

== largest joint stock company? ==

Where does this claim come from?  I found [http://www.dft.gov.uk/rhc/history.asp The railway heritage committee] say ''The LMS became the Empire’s largest joint stock company''. --[[User:Robert EA Harvey|Robert EA Harvey]] ([[User talk:Robert EA Harvey|talk]]) 20:09, 22 March 2013 (UTC)
