== 857 and 858 ==

Absent evidence to the contrary, the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' would be authoritative on whether the councils in 857 and 858 were the same or separate.  see also:  ''Carolingian Portraits: A Study in the Ninth Century'' By Eleanor Shipley Duckett, pp 215-216.

:''Authoritative'' or not, a council held in February 857 would be 858, depending on whether the reporter was using [[Old Style]] or [[New Style]]. One wouldn't be suggesting that there were ''two'' councils of Quierzy, one in 857 and one in 858. Or would one? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] ([[User talk:Wetman|talk]]) 23:56, 25 October 2009 (UTC)

::Unless I'm reading the Wikiconversion chart wrong, February 1, 857 O.S. would be February 5, 857 N.S., ''an addition of FOUR days''.  I hope this isn't the basis for your claim that there was only one council in 857-858.  Where am I going wrong?  [[User:Kenatipo|Kenatipo]] ([[User talk:Kenatipo|talk]]) 03:54, 26 October 2009 (UTC)
::According to Duckett, the Synod of November 858 was convened after Louis the German invaded the territory of Charles the Bald in August 858.   [[User:Kenatipo|Kenatipo]] ([[User talk:Kenatipo|talk]]) 04:12, 26 October 2009 (UTC)
