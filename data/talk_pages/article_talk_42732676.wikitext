==Article name==
The name of this temple should be changed to [[México City México Temple]], as [[Mexico City Mexico Temple]] in not exactly correct. -- [[User:12.106.111.10|12.106.111.10]] 00:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

:In the [[English language]], accents are not used in the word ''Mexico''. Also, if you go to the official website on this page, it doesn't use accents in the title either. [[User:Kman543210|Kman543210]] ([[User talk:Kman543210|talk]]) 07:39, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

– I noticed the recent changes by {{User|SMcCandlish}} to [[Template:LDS Temple/Mexico City Mexico Temple]] and the current name of this page.  However, the [http://lds.org/church/temples/mexico-city-mexico?lang=eng Official Website] of the LDS Church now lists the temple as &quot;México City México Temple&quot; (while in 2008 it may not have) with the accents, therefore shouldn't the name be with the &quot;é&quot;?  I admit that I don't know any Spanish, so this may not be an approprate use of the &quot;é&quot;, but it seems to me that if the &quot;Offical&quot; name used the &quot;é&quot;'s then so should we.  Additionally all the other Temples in that part of the world use &quot;México&quot; (see [[List_of_temples_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_by_geographic_region#Mexico]]) so it should be changed for consistency reasons..--[[User:ARTEST4ECHO|ARTEST4ECHO]] ([[User talk:ARTEST4ECHO|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/ARTEST4ECHO|&lt;sub&gt;contribs&lt;/sub&gt;]]) 19:55, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
:My bad! Revert away! And, yes, the proper Spanish spelling is &quot;México&quot;. If this were a template that people typed a lot, I'd argue to keep it at the plain-English orthography, but it's not. — &lt;font face=&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]]'''   &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:SMcCandlish|Talk⇒]] ʕ(&lt;sup&gt;Õ&lt;/sup&gt;ل&lt;sup&gt;ō&lt;/sup&gt;)ˀ&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|Contribs]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:38, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
::Done.  Thanks for being understanding and I totally agree that typing the &quot;é&quot; is a pain in the butt.--[[User:ARTEST4ECHO|ARTEST4ECHO]] ([[User talk:ARTEST4ECHO|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/ARTEST4ECHO|&lt;sub&gt;contribs&lt;/sub&gt;]]) 13:43, 4 January 2012 (UTC)
