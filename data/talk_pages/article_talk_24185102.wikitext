== Admrboltz's response to a contested PROD  was a WP:BLANKANDREDIRECT ==

It is inappropriate to respond to a contested PROD an article with a [[WP:BLANKANDREDIRECT]]. You should have responded with a [[WP:Proposed deletion]].  &amp;mdash;[[Special:Contributions/72.244.204.201|72.244.204.201]] ([[User talk:72.244.204.201|talk]]) 09:11, 10 September 2014 (UTC)
