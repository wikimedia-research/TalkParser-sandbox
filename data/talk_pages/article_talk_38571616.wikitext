== [[WP:COI]] disclosure ==

In the interest of full disclosure, I was previously associated with this organization during 2011. I am no longer associated, however I am highly passionate about it. As such, my edits will be [[WP:COI#Non-controversial_edits|non-controversial]] and well-supported by third-party sources.

As of April I am participating as a researcher in the organization, so I will no longer be making edits.
