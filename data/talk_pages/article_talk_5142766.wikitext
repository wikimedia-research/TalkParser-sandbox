== Glaring mistakes on NDP website ==
:''Originally submitted by [[user:Wsaiho|Wsaiho]] at [[National Day Parade, 2006]]''
On 21st July 2006, a [http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:dbf6cb0e86c8c010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcIOID:4c40825494d8c010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcDate:1153519140000 forum article] appeared on Straits Times, which detailed some grammatical mistakes on the NDP website.

=== Full Text of the Forum Letter ===

I WAS aghast when I was surfing the Net and found the National Day Parade 2006 website (http://www.ndp.org.sg). 

On it were very basic grammatical errors and many syntax errors unbecoming of a website that is representative of our country. 

It was stated that the website was designed by an external company and such low editorial standards make me wonder how the tender process was carried out, resulting in the company receiving the contract to design the website. 

Some of the glaring errors include the following: 

*'The treatment of the brushstrokes given the logo an Asian feel, and it denotes that Singapore is evolving into a global city but not forgetting our roots and values. The way the globe is tilt, it gives a feel that the world is revolving around Singapore and we are in the centre of all action.' 

A proper sentence would be: 'The brushstrokes give the logo an Asian feel and shows Singapore evolving into a global city while retaining its roots and values. The globe is tilted to show the world revolving around Singapore as we become the centre of all the action.' 


*'This year marks our nation 41st year of independence.' 

It is imperative that the National Day Parade (NDP) Exco rectifies the problem as soon as possible; it is embarrassing that a website which is supposed to glorify our nation's achievements over the past 41 years ends up making a mockery of our standard of English. 

I hope the NDP Exco will also explain how these mistakes came about.

=== Remedial Actions ===
Upon receiving the complaint, the National Day Parade website was updated, however grammatical errors can still be found on 22nd Jul.

== Other songs? ==
should we have a list of songs that are not theme songs, such as moments of magic, singapore town, 5 stars arising etc [[User:Ragnaroknike|Ragnaroknike]] ([[User talk:Ragnaroknike|talk]]) 15:31, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

== 2014 ==

I know that there are no official theme songs this year, but can we include the remakes of &quot;We Will Get There&quot; and &quot;One People, One Nation, One Singapore&quot;, and &quot;What Do You See&quot; in the theme song list?
