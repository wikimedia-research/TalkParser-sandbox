[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Faizan|Faizan]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/120.28.160.81|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:History of alcoholic beverages]] because it did not appear constructive. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Faizan|my talk page]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;   &lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid #000;background:#000&quot;&gt;[[User:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;Fai&lt;/span&gt;]][[User Talk:Faizan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0f0&quot;&gt;zan&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:23, 20 June 2013 (UTC)
