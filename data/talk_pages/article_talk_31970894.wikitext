Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:Ruth Lorenzo]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=432363711&amp;oldid=432350475 here] to [[Ruth Lorenzo]] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]].  The external link(s) you added or changed (http://http://theraspberrypattern.blogspot.com/&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bblog(?:cu|fa|harbor|mybrain|post|savy|spot|townhall)?\.com\b) --&gt;) is/are on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[blog]], [[forum]], [[free web hosting service]], [[fansite]], or similar site (see [[WP:ELNO|'Links to avoid', #11]]), then please check the information on the external site thoroughly. Note that such sites should probably not be linked to if they contain information that is in violation of the creator's [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT|copyright]] (see [[Wikipedia:COPYRIGHT#Linking to copyrighted works|Linking to copyrighted works]]), or they are not written by a recognised, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]]. Linking to sites that you are involved with is also strongly discouraged (see [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]]).&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam0 --&gt; --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 14:40, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia, one or more of the [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] you added to the page [[:Blowing a raspberry]] do not comply with our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines for external links]] and have been removed. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used as a platform for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion, and doing so is contrary to the goals of this project. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the [[Talk:Blowing a raspberry|article's talk page]] before reinserting it. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. &amp;nbsp;[[Category:User talk pages with Uw-spam1 notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam1 --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=442031684&amp;oldid=432717950 here] to [[Blowing a raspberry]] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]].

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not add or change content, as you did to [[:Blowing a raspberry]], without [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifying]] it by citing a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. Please review the guidelines at [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] and take this opportunity to add references to the article.

*Also, things can't &quot;represent&quot; in the way you claim they do. Moreover, it's complete bullshit. Urbandictionary is not accepted as a reliable source here, precisely for those kinds of reasons. Now stop messing around with the article please.
