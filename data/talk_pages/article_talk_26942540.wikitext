'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Joecultrera, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia!

{{#if:yes|&lt;br/&gt;|Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{BASEPAGENAME}}|your contributions]]}}{{#if: |, especially what you did for [[:{{{article}}}]]{{#if: |,|.}}}}{{#if: |, especially what you did for [[:{{{art}}}]]{{#if: |,|.}}}}{{#if: |&amp;nbsp;although it is being considered for deletion.}}{{#if: |&amp;nbsp;It was good talking to you on IRC.}}{{#if: |&amp;nbsp;Also, thank you for your message on my Talk Page.}}{{#if: |&amp;nbsp;Also, thank you for your message on the [[WP:HD|Help Desk]].}} {{#if: |&amp;nbsp;Also, thank you for your message on the [[WP:NCHP|New Contributors' Help Page]].}} {{#if: |It's great that you want to contribute to Wikipedia - the more constructive editors the better!}} {{#if: |You might want to [[Special:Userlogin|register an account]], which has [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|many benefits]], including the ability to create articles.}}

I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Getting the articles ''just right'' can be tricky - but there are lots of people to ask!

If you have any questions, just click on the ''Contact Me'' link after my signature at the end of this section. Alternatively, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], or ask your question on this page and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question.

By the way, when you are writing on a discussion page (or someone's talk page), it is considered good manners to ''sign'' your comment... to do this, just add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of your comment. That will put your user name ({{BASEPAGENAME}}) and the date/time at the end (or you can click on the [[File:Button_sig.png]] icon when you are editing. '''Never sign on an article page''' - only on a discussion page.

== Possible conflict of interest ==
When I created your account, I noticed that you work for a{{#if: yes|n}} {{#if: Electrical supply company|Electrical supply company|business}}{{#if: | &amp;nbsp;as a{{#if: |n}} {{{position}}}}}. I would refer you to the guidelines on Conflict of Interest (see [[WP:COI|here]]).

If your intention is to edit articles about the {{#if: Electrical supply company|Electrical supply company|business}} ({{#if:|or your clients&amp;nbsp;}}or yourself), I would suggest that anything that you want to add/change/remove is discussed on the relevant talk page (just click at the top of the article's page on the ''discussion'' tab) - and provide reliable and independent sources for anything to be changed (see [[Wikipedia:Independent sources]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]]). Also declare your connection with the {{#if: Electrical supply company|Electrical supply company|business}}.

If your intention is to create an article about the {{#if: Electrical supply company|Electrical supply company|business}} ({{#if:|or your clients&amp;nbsp;}}or yourself), I would suggest that you put a request in at [[WP:REQ|Requested Articles]], explaining your connection to the company, and what you would like to be put into an article. Ideally, this would include sources of information that are [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:IS|independent]] of the {{#if: Electrical supply company|Electrical supply company|business}}.
{{#if:|Rush PR Newswire published an article on 31 March 2010 entitled &quot;PR consultants should think twice before using Wikipedia to promote clients&quot; which might be useful reading matter, which can be found [http://rushprnews.com/2010/03/31/pr-consultants-should-think-twice-before-using-wikipedia-to-promote-clients here]}}

If your intention is to edit in other areas, then please accept my apologies&amp;nbsp;— as you will no doubt appreciate, we have a lot of people who create accounts to edit areas in which they are personally involved!

Enjoy editing here, and if you have any questions, ask for help by using any of the methods mentioned in my welcome message above!

Regards, -- '''''[[User:Phantomsteve|&lt;font color=&quot;#307D7E&quot;&gt;Phantom&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#55CAFA&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/font&gt;]]'''''/[[User talk:Phantomsteve|&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Phantomsteve|&lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;]]\ 17:02, 13 April 2010 (UTC)
