[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Gobonobo|Gobonobo]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/50.153.6.154|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Meteorology]] because it did not appear constructive. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[WP:sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Gobonobo|my talk page]]. Thanks.&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt; [[User:Gobonobo|&lt;font face=&quot;DejaVu Sans&quot; color=&quot;333300&quot;&gt;gobonobo&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User_talk:Gobonobo|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Gobonobo|&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:45, 26 August 2015 (UTC)
