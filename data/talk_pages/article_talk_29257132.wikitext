==Welcome==

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/99.24.221.111|your contributions]], especially what you did for [[Patty Griffin]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are a few good links for newcomers:

* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

Here are some other hints and tips:

* I recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits of having a username]].  (If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you instead.)
* When using [[Wikipedia:talk pages|talk pages]], please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~&amp;#126;~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Where to ask a question]], ask me on [[user talk:Aaron north|my talk page]], or type '''&lt;nowiki&gt; {{helpme}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will try to answer your questions as best as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]].&lt;!-- Template:welcome-anon --&gt;
