I removed the refs to him being a mutant. [[User:Noclevername|Noclevername]] 06:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)



There seems to be a recurring misunderstanding in the Folding Circle articles. Silk Fever, Bloodstrike, Smiling Tiger, Silhouette and Midnight's Fire are mutants despite their connection to the wellspring. The members of the folding circle were not turned into superhumans by all of a sudden being exposed to the wellspring. They recieve their powers because each of their mothers is descended from a cult that has been absorbing the energy of the wellspring for centuries. They are mutants much in the same way Beast is a mutant because his father worked in a nuclear plant. --[[User:ksofen666|ksofen666]] 05 February 2007.
