==Hindu is the right word ==

There are people who are unnecessarily deriving defferent names to current Hindu Dharma. Hindu Dharma is fusion of different philosopies. So you can't say the present Hindu Dharma is same Vedic Dharma.
Also in India legally only Hindu word is accepted not Vedic OR Sanatan. [[User:Truthlover|Truthlover]] 15:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

::The article is not about the letter of the law. It is about Hinduism (syncrectic fusions and everything). It is a fact that Vedic Dharma plays a central role in canonical Hinduism (in so far as the word &quot;canon&quot; applies to the Dharmic concept), even post-Vedantic classical Hinduism does not relegate the Vedas to the background IMHO.[[User:Subhash bose|Shiva&amp;#39;s Trident]] 17:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

==It should say ancient India not Indian subcontinent==
In the introductory it says that HInduism originated from the Indian SUbontinent...BUt this is not 100% true...Because technically HInduism was partly formed from areas that were once part of India, but are technically not on the Subocontinent...For example parts of Hinduism was established in areas like Iran &amp; Afghanistan, and both Iran and Afghanistan were part of ANCIENT INDIA....Another example is parts of it were formed in BUrma, which used to be part of India, but is not technically part of the INDIAN SUBCONTINENT....So instead of saying it was formed in the Indian subcontinent...It should say Ancient India instead ...

:I agree with you. Aryans and Hindus met in Afghanistan and Uttarapatha (adjoining portions of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan) for the first time. The region had a strong Hindu presence though it might not have been strictly a part of India. Madras and Kurus among others hailed from here. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 06:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

==Introductory Paragraph==
&quot;Hinduism is a religion that orginated from the Indian subcontinent. However it must be noted that Hinduism does not have one main holy book and the Vedas were not the only teachings to have influenced the religion.&quot;

Eh? Where is the continuity between the two sentences? The introductory paragraph for this important article has always been a mess, with repeated changes and reverts. When you make a change, please read the paragraph once again and ensure that it makes sense.

==Serious issues in the article==
I would suggest that someone to take time to address the following issues:
# Lot of new material has been added in a haphazard manner.  I point to the Tantra section which uses all kinds of terms and information with no references or even wikilinking.
# Their should be a controversy section in the article.  However, any effort to do so has been continuously reverted/deleted or turned into picking on other religions.
# Lot of text has been added without any references.  Examples: &quot;Though historians do not agree on the specific period,&quot;, &quot;In contemporary India, caste differences are slowly disappearing with modernization, but occasional tensions and prejudices still remain.&quot;  Not a single reference in &quot;Origins of Hinduism&quot; section.  I can keep going - basically, people are more interested in adding information pertaining to their own denomination or view on the matter without worrying about evidence. 
# False references.  The reference by Vanita R. should not even be in the article anymore because all the text that was pertaining to that reference is (for some mysterious reason) no longer present in the article.  That makes me wonder how many other references are still present in the bibliography but without the relevant text?
In its current stage, I believe that the article does not meet FA criteria any longer and is a candidate for a FARC. --[[User:Blacksun|Blacksun]] 22:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

'''On the section on Tantra''':

Pardon my barging in, but I notice that there is ''already'' a separate wiki on [[Tantra]]. Perhaps we could, for conciseness, mention in a sentence or two about Tantra (particularly its relationship with Hinduism proper) and refer to the Tantra wiki itself. Better still, I feel, would be an omission of this Tantra section altogether. After all, having two separate writings on Tantra is not only superfluous but could lead to the problem of information conflict.

Tidying up could be done for the ''Tantra'' section but this need not be limited to that section alone; other sections could be tightened up as well. Some valuable guidance for structuring this wiki could be obtained if we compare it with other encyclopedia articles (online or printed) on Hinduism or other religions.

Also, I have removed unnecessary addition of Bhakti section because with different approachs, Bhakti is present in Adavita, Davita and others. So, I think there is no need to define Bhakti as an alternate culture of worship. Because of the removal of both Tantra and Bhakti sections, now there is no &quot;Alternate culture of worship&quot; section. - [[User:Holy Ganga|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#884400; size:2; color:#00FF00;&quot;&gt; Holy Ganga&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;size:-1;&quot;&gt; [[User talk:Holy Ganga|talk]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 11:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

==Consensus on Naming Conventions==

Dear Wikipedians,

Among the basic requisites of a quality (and hence, a feature) article is consistency. I notice a lack of consistency in terminology in this article. For example, in some sections of the article, the ''Rig Veda'' is referred to as the ''Rigveda'', and vice versa. Similarly, the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in some parts of the article, is spelled as ''Bhagvad Gita''. I also noticed references to ''Ram'' (is it equivalent to ''Rama''?)

I highlight only some instances of inconsistencies in spelling. There may be more in the article to the eyes of discerning readers. I therefore suggest that Wikipedians who maintain or edit this site adhere to a fixed set of naming rules. [[User:Splashprince|Splashprince]] 09:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

==Citation and Substantiation==

When a statement is introduced into the article, it is recommended that a reliable source (a peer-reviewed article or a published book) is cited to support the statement. I believe this Hinduism article requires a systematic review to ensure that entries in it are substantiated, as far as it is possible. Admittedly, this is certainly not an easy task, but it would contribute to the article's credibility as a source of reference. This is, after all, a feature Wikipedia article and often a first source of reference for Internet users. [[User:Splashprince|Splashprince]] 09:25, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

== Oldest existent religion in the world? ==

&quot;It is the oldest existent religion in the world.&quot; - As the second sentence in the article, I believe this statement needs qualifying. Previous editions of this article stated that Hinduism was the oldest of the &quot;major world religions.&quot; This is more correct, as Hinduism is undoubtedly this. But the question of what constitutes an 'existent religion' is open to interpretation. The religion of the Aboriginal people of Australia is much older than Hinduism, and is still existent. Whether this is a formal 'religion' is debatable, and even the Wikipedia article [[religion]] says the definition of the word is not a sharp one. I suggest we go back to the original statement of Hinduism being the oldest of the world's major religions, because this is not dependent on what definition of 'religion' is used. Cheers.

:: It would hardly make sense to assign any beginning dates for evolved religions (those without a founder, and which keep changing with time.) Clearly, some beliefs can be traced back to the beginning of civilisation itself (possibly, even earlier if we think of primates, which too have some ethical codes.), certainly (in case of Hinduism) a lot can be traced to the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], and in case of aboriginal Australian religions, to some other prehistorical beliefs. Thus, I don't see any point in trying to figure out which is older. Either the  &quot;oldest&quot; statement be qualified with more specific details (like oldest of world's ''major'' religions, &quot;major&quot; linked to number of adherents), or just go with the original statement.

== The Definition of Hinduism and Against Abramitic Campaign of the &quot;Galileans&quot; ==

Raj, are you again at it? Two hoots for anyone's personal traditions, I follow the tradition of my family worshipping Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, Kartikeya, Durga, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Saraswati (whom Sankara forgot to include in the Gods permissible for worship, though he added Kartikeya later). Do I have to be a Smarta or a Madhva to be a hindu? I thought we had discussed this in detail. Returned to the page after a few days and find it changed drastically without discussion. I am a polytheist and a hindu. Who are you to define hinduism for me? For that matter, who are Sankara, Madhva, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabhacharya, Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Raman Maharshi, Aurobindo, or the Mutt Heads to define Hinduism for me? I will study the scriptures and their views (they views are important for me) but make my own decisions. What authority any one has to call me a non-hindu. Hindus would keep defining Hinduism in their own individual ways. If you mean a Brahman which includes you and me, then 'it' is not even a God, then 'it' does not need to be worshipped. I do not know which 'one God' you are talking about. Neither Smarta Hinduism, nor Madhva Hinduism, nor even your Ramakrishna Hinduism is the only Hinduism. I would keep on contesting people who would like to fetter Hinduism in any way. Aupmanyav 10:47, 5 June 2006 (UTC) 
:Raj, would you kindly tell me how did the various traditions in Hinduism came about? People were not satisfied with the explanations available to them at that time and came up with their own explanations which were accepted and followed by other people. Sankara's explanation did not satisfy Madhva, Madhva's explanation did not satisfy Ramanuja and so on. This would and aught to keep on happening. Hinduism is not a dead religion. If we were to be attached to only the existant tradition, there would not have been a plethora of traditions in Hinduism. There is nothing wrong with a Hindu being a polytheist. How many to worship and whom is between me and my God/Gods. Nobody can or should interfere in this. Otherwise 'Vipra badhudha vadanti' is meaningless. Aupmanyav 11:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
(The above messages were archived but I am looking for answers from Raj or other discussants who may hold different views. Please excuse me if I have done something wrong as per Wikipedia rules)


You totally misunderstood me. There are many traditions within Hinduism and I am talking of the four major traditions. You and many others are of course entitled to your opinions. For example, Jehovah's witness, a religion that is considered Christian by some, don't consider Jesus to be God the second member of the the Trinity but merely consider Jesus to be God's first creation. Does that make it Christian?  Not necessarily so. You ignore the upanishadic statement: Brahman is one.

There's no right way to define Hinduism; sure everyone has their interpretation but some contradict the Vedic and Upanishad view on the matter.

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:19, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

Second, Hanuman is not God. He is a great bhakta of God. As for Saraswait, She is an different aspect of Durga. Krishna is the same as Vishnu and non-different. The same goes with Rama. Shiva is the second aspect of God in the Trimurti concept. Even Kartikeya is simply another aspect of Shiva.

Where are all those gods? I can boil down Hinduism into really 3 forms of God: Vishnu, Shiva and power personifed, Devi. All others are simply aspects of them. To even condense further, Brahman is one.

You may be a polytheist but that's your view. 

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
:Raj, you are ignoring the second verse of Hymn One of Book One of RigVeda which says 'Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers, He shall bring hitherward the Gods' (अग्निः पूर्वेभिर्र्षिभिरीड्यो नूतनैरुत | स देवानेह वक्षति ||). There are many other richas like that. Should I quote? [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 06:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)


There are verses like that even in the Bible. Genesis 26: 26 Then God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, [b] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.&quot;
Let us seems to indicate more than one God. 

So Hinduism evolved from polytheism to monism. Is that any suprise for one of the oldest religions on earth, Aupmanyav?

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 09:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
:It is very uncharitable of you to say that Hinduism evolved from polytheism to Monism, as if monism is in anyway superior to the other beliefs. As an upholder of traditions, this should make you sad. In accepting monotheism or monism, Hindus (including the Aryans) have degressed from their original traditions, which were polytheistic. Then, some of the major traditions are not monist. No, I am not surprised by the fact that Hinduism is the one of the oldest religion on earth. This happened because personal beliefs were not considered important enough to fight for, your views could be different from mine, as long as Dharma (duty/right action) was maintained. Personal beliefs, polytheism to monism, after all, are philosophical speculations only. Please do not give examples from Christianity, they are not worthy in a discussion on Hinduism. Man does not rule over all that move. The likeness with God, is He like the Homo Habilis, or Homo Neandertalis, or Homo Sapiens? And where from did he pickup the likeness of Eve?

:Do the Vedas, Upanishads, and Darshanas say one thing? If I go by Samkhya, Vaisesika, or Purva Mimamsa, I would not need a God. Why have you picked just one sentence 'Brahman is one', juxtappose that with Madhva's view that 'Ishwara and Jeeva are essentially different'. You rightly say that &quot;there is no 'right way' to define Hinduism&quot;, but then proceed to define Hinduism in your own way. Kartikeya is not Shiva, he is Shiva's son. Saraswati is not Durga, but Brahma's daughter. And Hanuman is a God, why otherwise half the Hindus would visit 'Sankat Mochan' temples all over India on a Tuesday or a Friday? I may warn you that you are in danger of earning the displeasure of a professional wrestler or a Brahmachari who worships Hanuman.

:Please spare, do not boil down Hindu Gods to three and then to one, in the process you may boil down Hinduism itself. I do not mind many, whatever my personal beliefs be, the more the merrier, more holidays, more festivals; what is wrong in that? I thank you for your magnanimity when you say 'You may be a polytheist but that is your view'. I respond with the same. You may be a monist but that is your view. Do not foist it in Wikipedia as the Hindu view. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 10:56, 8 June 2006 (UTC)


well, aupmanyav, neither you should say that polytheism is the Hindu view. I do not define what Hinduism is but I am only defending an Advaitan way. Who said Saraswati is Brahma's daughter? She is Brahma's wife. Even in your definition, you differ from what many Hindus believe and you contradict yourself. There is nothing wrong with many views. Truth is one, the wise call by different names, the Vedas say.  Hanuman is not God; all his actions were devoted for Rama. Neither should you foist your view as a Hindu view. I am only defending an Advaitan view.

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC)


As for your statement, that Karkiteya is Siva's son, that may be true.
But Swami [[Sivananda]] in his book, Lord Shanmuka and His worship, at http://www.dlshq.org/download/shanmukha.htm said that &quot;Lord Subrahmanya is an Avatara of Lord Siva. All incarnations are manifestations of the One Supreme Lord. Lord Subrahmanya and Lord Krishna are one. Lord Krishna says in the Gita, “Senaninam Aharn Skandah,”—“Of the Generals, I am Skanda.” The Lord manifests Himself from time to time in various names and forms for establishing Dharma and punishing the wicked.

Lord Subrahmanya is a ray born of the Chaitanya of Lord Siva. He is the energy of Lord Siva. Valli and Deivayani are His two Divine consorts. They represent the Iccha Shakti and the Kriya Shakti of the Lord. He is a Pratyaksha Devata in this Kali Yuga, like Hanuman. He bestows on His devotees material and spiritual prosperity and success in all their undertakings, even at the slightest devotion shown to Him. He is worshipped much in South India. Guha, Muruga, Kumaresa, Karttikeya, Shanmukha (he who has six faces), Subrahmanya, Skanda, Velayudha (he who wears the Spear), Saravanabhava are synonymous terms. &quot;

As for Madhva, he also said Brahman was one. Just the soul is separate from Brahman, unlike Advaita.

::We have the following in the description of Hinduism: 'The term Hinduism is heterogeneous, as Hinduism consists of several schools of thought. It encompasses many religious rituals that widely vary in practice, as well as many diverse sects and philosophies. Many Hindus, influenced by Advaita philosophy, venerate an array of deities, considering them manifestations of the one supreme monistic Cosmic Spirit, Brahman, while many others focus on a singular concept of God, as in Vaishnavism, Saivism and Shaktism.[3]'

::Would it be correct to replace it by: 'Hinduism consists of two parts. Dharma (duty, right action) which includes interaction with family and society, the traditions, rituals and practices of a person's society; and Vishwas (personal belief). While the observance of the first is essential, no boundaries are fixed for the second. That is the reason why a Hindu can be a polytheist, monotheist, monist, pantheist, or even an atheist. Followers of Advaita believe in one supreme cosmic sprit, 'Brahman'; while Vaishnavas, Shaivas, and Shaktas focus on a singular concept of God.[3]'

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

Hey Where are my posts? :) However I 100% Agree with all Aupmanyav's considerations ;), only one note for Raj, Monism isn't incompatible with Polytheism and even Monism isn't Monotheism, Monistic Polytheism historically is a reality, Neo-Platonism for example is a Monistic Polytheism (*), Deities/Divinities/Gods-Goddesses (and also Souls) are emanations or hypostases of The One, this doesn't mean that they are only different parodies or disguises of a Unique GOD (like at a Carneval Party where a GOD-PERSON is all the guests at the same time... and it's always IT or HIM with Its/His personality, this is an abramitic view), every Deity has its own personality and qualities or powers, or if you want it IS (and not only &quot;represent&quot;, 'cos this term may suggest the idea of an illusion, a disguise of the same GOD) a different aspect with its own personality and powers of a Unique Supreme Divine Energy or Entity or Reality, The One, Brahman, The Absolute-Infinite, The All, etc. This Supreme Divine Essence can have a Personal or better a Main Coscience, M.C. that can be Personificated, see Ishvara Deva (or Brahma in ancient times) or The Logos, or The Nous; However this is NOT Monotheism... The Absolute-Infinite, Brahman etc. can have a Main Coscience that can be personificated, but subsist the existence of all Deities, each one with its own coscience, personality etc. each one part of The Absolute-Infinite.


(*)Neo-Platonism isn't only the Plotinus' point of view, however Plotinus was a supporter of Polytheism, but other neo-platonic filosophers are more significant about the support and justification of polytheism. 

Greetings, --[[User:Antioco79|Antioco79]] 21:59, 9 June 2006 (UTC)


Antioco, I agree with you and respectfully disagree. Monism is not compatible with polytheism. Monism is beyond monotheism, which I do agree. Here are other comments:
This system common in Advaitan Hinduism is often perceived as polytheistic; it is also a form of inclusive monotheism, where one God is perceived as having many forms. In contrast, a hard polytheist thinks that two gods are different, i.e., [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]], for example. An inclusive monotheist such as a Smarta, on the other hand, thinks that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of a common God. For example, the Smarta theologians, influenced by Advaita philosophy, have cited many references to support this view. In one example, they interpret verses in both the Shri Rudram, the most sacred mantra in Shaivism, and the Vishnu sahasranama, one of the most sacred prayers in Vaishnavism, to show this belief. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the only true God worthy of worship, and worship of other forms as subordinate or simply incorrect.

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:45, 9 June 2006 (UTC)


As this site [http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part14/chap9.htm] states, 
'the Paramatman [[Brahman]] is one and only one. He it is that creates, sustains and destroys. And it is he who exfoliates as the the many different deities. Why does he do so? He has not cast people in the same mould. He has created them all differently, with different attitudes, the purpose being to make the affairs of the world interesting by imparting variety to them. The Paramatman himself assumes different forms to suit the temperament of different people so that each worship him in the form he likes and obtain happiness. This is the reason why the one and only Paramatman manifests himself as so many different deities.....Those who are capable of looking upon all deities as the manifestations of the one and only Paramatman have no cause for exclusive devotion to any one of them. It is only when we think that one deity is separate from- or alien to- another that the question arises of giving up one for another. If we realise that all are the different disguises of the One Reality, the various gods and goddesses potrayed in the Puranas, with all the differences among them, will be understood to be nothing but the lila or sport of Supreme Being. It is the One alone that seems divided into manifold entities. This is to help men of various attitudes and temperaments. If this truth is recognised we shall be able to see the stories in the Puranas- stories that seem contradictory- in the true light.&quot;

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 00:28, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

Raj, sorry but Neo-Platonism is a proof that Monism and Polytheism are compatible and complete themselves each other, however if Monism is reduced to a different doctrinal form of Monotheism is not Monism, if The One is the Only One GOD and Deities are only parodies of IT this is not Monism, and the theologians that assert it are in error, this is Monotheism.
I go further and I ask you if Brahman is the only Supreme BEING, like it could be a Person, who are you? and what are Souls? are we all disguises of Brahman? are we all puppets of It? the Monistic point of view is based on the concept of the Essential Unity of all the plurality of beings and things, but this doesn't mean that this Supreme Essence is the only existing BEING (in sense of a unique person, personality, being etc.), if Brahman is the only BEING and if All the Reality is only a BEING this is not Monism is ULTRA-Monotheism! and I know that your point of view Raj is not the view of the common indian people, maybe some currents or part of them or some theologians can assert it but however the view of Brahman like a Super-Being-GOD is not the only view, it's more common to consider Brahman as a Supreme Divine Energy that pervades all the reality and IS all the reality but not in sense of a cancellation of the plurality.

&quot;The eighteen Purāṇas are divided into three groups of six. The groups and their contents are: 1) the Brahmā Purāṇas: the Brahma Purāṇa, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Bhaviṣhya Purāṇa, and Vāmana Purāṇa; 2) the Viṣhnu Purāṇas: the Viṣhnu Purāṇa, Bhāgavata Purāṇa, Nāradīya Purāṇa, Garuḍa Purāṇa, Padma Purāṇa, and Varāha Purāṇa; and 3) the Shiva Purāṇas: the Vāyu Purāṇa, Liṅga Purāṇa, Skanda Purāṇa, Agni Purāṇa, Matsya Purāṇa, and Kūrma Purāṇa.&quot; - This is the only part that I feel still needs wiklinking.

==On Advaita Vedanta and &quot;Monism&quot;==

It is extremely innacurate to associate Advaita with &quot;monism&quot;. &quot;Monism&quot; is a western philosophical term for asserting that, in a duality, one term of the duality comes from the other. Advaita Vedanta has nothing to do with such concepts. [[User:TwoHorned|TwoHorned]] 10:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:Not true. It depends on what your definition of monism is.
:according to www.dictionary.com, monism can mean
:1. The view in metaphysics that reality is a unified whole and that all existing things can be ascribed to or described by a single concept or system.
:2. The doctrine that mind and matter are formed from, or reducible to, the same ultimate substance or principle of being.
:
:I think advaita fits into one of those categories, definitely the first one.
:
:[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 12:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
:: The first definition of monism you have found from www.dictionary.com does not apply to Advaita Vedanta for the simple reason that Western Metaphysics does not contemplate non-manifestation. Then, accordingly, when www.dictionary.com asserts that &quot;that reality is a unified whole&quot; they assume the equality between reality and manifestation, which is in formal contradiction with the most basic Advaita Vedanta statement. You should have  looked upon the Wikipedia article for [[Monism]], which explains with better accuracy the term. In that article, you will find the indication they give about substantial monism: &quot;Substantial Monism, (One thing) which holds that there is one substance&quot;. The &quot;substance&quot; which is referred to there clearly indicates that, to use Hindu terminology, they don't go beyond Prakriti. Consequently, in the classical Western definition of monism, every duality is resolved, not transcendentally, but by derivation from a single &quot;universal&quot; substance, which is equivalent to the definition of &quot;monism&quot; I gave in the first place, a definition you wrongly declared as untrue. Again, Advaita Vedanta goes infinitely higher than that. If you consider the other significations of &quot;monism&quot;, you will also notice that the association of  &quot;monism&quot; with pantheism clearly indicate how Advaita Vedanta is foreign to these considerations, because pantheism is clearly related to naturalism, a notion in formal contradiction with Advaita Vedanta. [[User:TwoHorned|TwoHorned]] 13:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
:::ok, I agree with your reasoning. Thanks for the clarification. You are indeed correct that Advaita does contemplate non-manifestation. [[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 23:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

==Hindu symbolism==
In the section &quot;Hindu symbolism&quot;, the descriptions associated to the two last items are quite problematic:

1- Swastika. First, an important meaning of that marvellous symbol is not mentionned: the Swastika is a symbol of the action of the Principle on the universal Manisfestation. The four segments are tangent to the circle centered on the cross, and the circle (symbolizing Manifestation)  itself is not present, which is a clear indication that the Swastika symbolizes the dynamic action of the centre (Principle) over the Manisfestation, not the Manifestation in itself. Since two orientations are naturally associated with a circle, you easily obtain in that way the two possible orientations for the Swastika. The two possible orientations are present in India, although one is more prevalent in Hinduism, but the two orientations exist and are perfectly orthodox. There is an evident connection with the notion of Pradakshina. Consequently, the evil in the utilization of that symbol by the Nazis does not come from their particular choice of an orientation, but rather from the subversion of an authentic traditional symbol to make it a political one, as they did not understand its meaning. As matter of fact, I think that it is even not worth mentionning the perverted use that the Nazis made of that symbol: after all, the Swastika is being used since millenaries, by Hindus in particular, so why focus on a malevolent and recent interpretation ?

2- Mandala. In a similar vein, the most important signification of the two triangles is missing: it is a symbol based on the number 6 symbolism and it is a symbol of Analogy. It is not at all a symbol of &quot;opposite energies&quot;, what is written here is false. And its use as a political flag by Israelis also results, like in item 1 above, (although from an opposite perspective of course) in the political perversion of an authentic symbol by people who don't understand it. A reference to the &quot;Salomon Seal&quot; would have been more appropriate than the &quot;Star of David&quot;, if one insists on drawing correspondances with Judaism. And, incentally, please note that this symbol is used in Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and also other traditions.

3- For the Aum symbol, I think that what is written here is correct.

Consequently, I brought little changes to the &quot;Hindu Symbolism&quot; section, to make it more satisfactory. Any reactions are welcome.

== Attitudes Towards Sex ==

Shouldn't the main page contain an article about this? It is, after all, a rather important part of life, it wouldn't be around without it. Most religions attach some form of importance to it so I'm surprised this article doesn't contain any comment on the subject.--[[User:Tiresais|Tiresais]] 16:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
:I disagree.  Unless a religion has specific directive towards sex, their is little reason to include in the article.  Attitudes towards sex is very much cultural rather than religious and it is hard to generalize that in an article about Hinduism to any type of accuracy as cultural attitudes vary from region to region.  --[[User:Blacksun|Blacksun]] 16:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

:: There is obviously mention of it in the article, so a general point on the subject could be express. Attitudes from the religion's point of view are set in stone, or ink and paper. Cultural issues are rather a matter of personal perspective and interpretation. A general point from the religion doesn't need to be accurate.--[[User:Tiresais|Tiresais]] 18:30, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Attitudes from the religion's point of view are not always set in stone or ink and paper.  It is afterall a human that writes things and that always changes.  Don't confuse cultural with religious.  I am not really aware of any strict sexual guidelines in Hinduism that are not cultural - but then again i am not an expert.  --[[User:Blacksun|Blacksun]] 07:50, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

::::I'm not confusing cultural and religious. Take an example of Catholicism, the religion strictly denounces sex before marriage, but cultural differences may put more or less emphasis on the point (Africa is stricter due to prevalent STD's for example). If there are no strict guidelines then fair enough, but it seems a bit weird that they'd not mention it. --[[User:Tiresais|Tiresais]] 08:30, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

Hinduism is not victorian, it accepts sex as very important to life, makes it into four things which must be done in life (Arth, Kama, Dharma, Moksha), and must be indulged in according to Dharma, never to excess. How otherwise one would be free of pitri-rina, if not by begetting not only sons but daughters too. Giving a daughter in marriage (Kanyadana) is a simplest way to Moksha. As for marriage, nineteen ways are listed, some are looked down upon (Rakshasa Vivah, Paishach Vivah - abduction and rape), some are tolerated (Gandharva Vivah - love), while others are commended (Prajapatya Vivah - marriage arranged with consent of parents and gifts for the couple).

== Hinduism And Monotheism ==

Shouldn't this article note that Hinduism is a monotheistic religion? In reality it is. Most Hindus believe &quot;There is One truth, but paths are many.&quot; All Hindu deities are supposedly manifestations of the &quot;One&quot; true God called the Brahman. It is similar to Christianity with the Father, Jesus, and Holy Spirit being actually three versions of the true &quot;One&quot; God. Shouldn't this be noted in the first section of this article? [[User:Zachorious|Zachorious]] 04:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
:There has never been a census of how many Hindus are monotheist or monists or polytheist or atheist or henotheist or pantheist or ...theist. A hindu will be within his rights to change his belief anytime, e.g., from being an atheist to being a polytheist; and return back to atheism after a week's time. Hinduism gives complete freedom to its adherents as far as philosophical speculations go. An opinion on percentages would be very personal.

And for your information, I have had an explicit course in Indian philosophy, + read several books, many of which I can quote. All of them explicitly say that Vaisheshika is theistic philosophy. Only Sankhya  and Mimansa were atheistic (that too not horribly atheistic, just mildly so). Original Vaisheshika sutras had only one reference to God, but the total philosophy has to be taken over the centuries. And later philosophers of Vaisheshika do make logical statements and characteristics about God.

::::::::A History of Indian Philosophy, Surendranath Dasgupta (http://hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/hinduism/philo/ch08.asp)
::::::::Cygnus_Hansa, the probable date of Kanada is 600 BC, whereas the first commentary on Vaisesika by Pras'astapada came in 5th or 6th century AD. And what Pras'astapada wrote was not strictly a commentary, he wrote what he believed after reading Kanada's philosophy. The time difference is some 900 years. Many things had changed by that time. The Vedic beliefs had taken a secondary position and indigenous Hinduism had reasserted itself. That is why God became important and the spirit of independant enquiry was lost. That is why whereas there is no reference to God in Vaisesika Sutra, the commentaries show it as theistic. Note that Poorva Mimamsa also considered performance of actions in accordance with Vedic injunctions enough for our life. More over, Vaisesika got entangled with Nyaya and its pecularities were lost.

== Indian words ==

I'm no expert on the subject, but aren't many words here spelled weirdly?  For instance, shouldn't &quot;Vishnu&quot; be either Vishnu (if simple English) or &quot;{{Unicode|Viṣṇu}}&quot; (if properly transliterated)?  It's &quot;{{Unicode|Viṣhṇu}}&quot; in the article—a spelling which seems to be a combination of both, taking both the English &quot;sh&quot; and the &quot;{{Unicode|ṣ}}&quot; which is supposed to replace it. The article [[Vishnu]] uses &quot;{{Unicode|Viṣṇu}}&quot; as its Sanskrit transliteration. &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;[[User:Osgoodelawyer|'''Oz''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Osgoodelawyer|''&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Lawyer&lt;/span&gt;'']]&lt;/font&gt; 19:44, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:Upanishads are part of Shruti and the others are part of Smriti, which also has a section. The only exception is Kam Sutra, which doesn't have a mention because it isn't really a relgious book. There are few refs to dharma etc., but it is just a Sanskrit book on family relationships and love. Bear in mind that not all existing Sanskrit texts are based on religion. There are also the panchtantra and hitopadesh. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[User:DaGizza|Gizza]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:DaGizza|Chat]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' &lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/DaGizza|&amp;#169;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

== Consensus on &quot;core concepts&quot; ==

Lately, [[user:Maleabroad|Maleabroad]] and I have entered into a cycle of insertions and deletions. Like some other cycles--''samsara,'' for example--this one would be good to escape. 

As I see it, [[user:Maleabroad|Maleabroad]], the problem is that what you are inserting as &quot;core concepts&quot; of Hinduism are concepts many Hindus may agree with but many others may not.

Could I ask, [[user:Maleabroad|Maleabroad]], that before once again inserting this material you place your suggestions about it here on the Talk page and see whether we can arrive at a consensus? Thank you very much. Respectfully, [[User:O Govinda|O Govinda]] 23:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

==Indian law==
I just cut:

:''However, Article 15 of the [[Indian Constitution]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of an individual's caste, while Article 17 prohibits practice of the social stigma of [[untouchability]] &lt;ref name=indianconstitution&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/p03.htm &quot;The Indian Constitution&quot;]. Part III (Articles 15 &amp; 17). &quot;Fundamental Rights&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. In contemporary India, caste differences are slowly disappearing with modernization, but occasional tensions and prejudices still remain.{{Talkfact}}''

...from the article.  This seems to be trying to argue some point about the caste system and Indian law and culture that does not seem to me to be directly relevent to the religion of Hinduism.  If I'm wrong, and this is crucial information about Hinduism, I'd like to encourage some rewording to avoid citing specific articles of the Constitution of India and then immediately changing to a breezy tone of unsourced generalisation.

== No polytheism in Hinduism ==

After long discussions I was able to add to the Hinduism page that there are Hindus who worship many Gods. I return to the page after some days to find that polytheists have been removed from the Hindu fold and only Monism or Dualism is acceptable to the powers that be. That too without any discussion. It seems that the Hinduism page should be made into in many pages, each detailing the views of only one person, like Aupmanyav's page on Hinduism, or Dangerous-Boy's page on Hinduism, or Cygnus-Hansa's page on Hinduism, or Raj's page on Hinduism, or Holy Ganga's page on Hinduism. That is why Hinduism pages cannot even maintain their FA status. That is the reason we do not find any improvement in Hinduism pages, and there is no one else to blame for this but ourselves.

I am sure that people have included many silly other things in Hinduism pages. Now, how many times a person can take up the issue again and try to put things right? People should understand that they are spoiling the introduction to Hinduism to millions of people through Wikipedia in this way. Hinduism will always have all kinds of people in its fold, polytheists as well as atheists (like me).

==Atheistic views in hinduism==

Clause 2(b) of article 25 of Indian constitution says Buddhist and Jains to be Hindu. Buddhist and Jains are athiestic religions as there is no place for creationist god in their philosophy. other links are [http://www.ece.mtu.edu/faculty/jeffc/students/sskaramp/second/atheism.html]
[http://www.darkfiber.com/atheisms/atheisms/hinsankyha.html]
[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/690490.cms]. moreover Nastika in Hindu terms is related to non-believing of vedas, while atheism refers to non beleiving of existence of God. so, although Nastiq covers only Buddhism, Jainism and Charavaka for Hindu philosophy, athiesm covers nastiqs along with poorva mimamsa and sankhya.   

This page just covers about Vaishnavism rather than Hinduism. All the six schools of thoughts covered here are generally considered vaishnavites (I may be wrong here). the current page seems to ignore shavist sects like [[Aghori]] as non-Hindus. This page, also, does not adequately covers Shaktism either.

Moreover, I could not find wikipedia policy which bans me from referring to other wikilinks. If somebody could point me to that. [[User:Nidhishsinghal|nids]] 22:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

there is no mention of atheistic views in this page. it is an integral point of hinduism. i can claim myself an adherent of bhagvata gita and a athiest and a hindu at the same time. i shall mention that on the introduction, but i am waiting for the criticism.

also i can just claim myself to be an athiest and a hindu. the wikipedia definition currently denies me the right. it mentioned &quot;even an athiest can be a hindu&quot; in the past, but it has been removed in the current version.
[[User:Nidhishsinghal|nids]] 03:42, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

You may say atheism is part of Hinduism but I am little puzzled how you can be an adherent of the Gita and atheism at the same time? The Gita is profoundly theistic!

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 10:11, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Ok, but I doubt the view &quot;even an athiest can be a hindu&quot; was removed because other editors though you couldn't claim yourself an &quot;adherent of bhagvata gita and a athiest and a hindu at the same time&quot;. The reason was probably you did not include a reference. [[User:Addhoc|Addhoc]] 10:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

this is a common misconception that gita supports theism. actually the gita is a hard book to understand, not for words but for the meanings. people have and can interpret it as for polythiesm, monotheism and athiesm. but anyway its an outstanding book. 

===Rebutal to atheism and polytheism in Gita===

I disagree about your comment about the Gita.  Chapter 16, verse 7 states that demoniac think that the universe is without a moral basis, without a God, born of mutual union, brought about by lust.&quot;
That comment is strongly theistic.
As for polytheism, here are some comments about that:
Vaishnavites believe that Krishna himself stated that worship of deities other than  [[Vishnu]], are incorrect as such worship would only lead to temporal benefits, rather than [[mukti]], which [[Vaishnavites]] believe that only [[Vishnu]] can grant. For example, [[Krishna]] said: &quot;Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me.&quot; (Gita: 7:21-22) Another quote in the Gita states: &quot;O [[Arjuna]], even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., [[Devas]], for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe.&quot; (Gita: 9:23) 

This clearly distinguishes between worship of Vishnu and devas.

People may disagree about these comments but these are common interpretations.

[[User:Raj2004|Raj2004]] 01:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

i was just making an point that it deserves to point out that you can be a self proclaimed hindu, even if you are an athiest. 

i know several people, who are not allowed to keep mahabharata at their homes (especially upper caste conservative brahmins), and they also do not keep a copy of geeta, (forget about reading it). they say that keeping a copy of mahabharat in home promotes sibling rivalries. arent they hindus then. 

i strongly support the inclusion of comment &quot;even an athiest can be a hindu&quot; in the introductory statement. please cite your criticisms.
[[User:Nidhishsinghal|nids]] 10:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
:Your points are valid only in some homes and families (I'm shocked that such customs exist!), not universally. In [[Sanskrit]], an atheist is called ''Nirishvara-vadi'', such a view is condemned in the ''Gita''. You'd know this if you had read the ''Gita''. Of course, I'm not saying atheism has never been a part of Hinduism. For example, [[Mimamsa]]kas and [[Samkhya]]s were atheists, but all the other schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] are theists as per history. --[[User:Babub|&lt;sup&gt;Babub&lt;/sup&gt;→]][[User talk:Babub|&lt;font color = &quot;DarkBlue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 11:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:babub correctly proves my point. there were athiestic schools of thoughts in Hinduism like the ones mentioned by babub. i just want them to be included in the main article. not their discription, just the mention. (those athiestic schools of thoughts may not be surviving today, but they were very much part of the hinduism)

:and babub, even i was surprised when i knew from one of my brahmin friends that they were discouraged to read or even keep a copy of mahabharat in their homes. but believe me, consult a traditional conservative brahmin, and you can easily find this fact for yourself.

You can refer to the above comment by Babub, 11:08, 9th August.

For now, can i just add in the introductory portion, that an athiest can be a Hindu. Also you do not need a certificate of any organization to be called a hindu, (like being baptized to become christian).

you can also refer to current [[Mimamsa]] page for their athiestic history. does it qualify???

here, i have pointed out just the wikipedia pages and havent even metioned the caraka philosophy. i am refering to mimamsa and sankya philosophy. i have also quoted that. isnt not believing in god &quot;athiesm&quot;. caravaka was a different case since they did not believed in vedas. if dab thinks that not believing in vedas is athiesm, i wonder that in that case what will be christianity???

::Carry on, nids, I am with you. Hindus can be atheists or polytheists. Babub, please understand, being an atheist does not diminish my Hinduism or my love for India. Samkhya, Uttara mimamsa, Vaisheshika, are all atheistic. Raj and others have agreed to it once, but then the page was changed again without any discussion. Now about Vedas or Geeta, I do not believe in God, so there is no question of Vedas being always present or being written by any God, or Geeta being written by a God. The Vedas were written by seers (visualizers, inspired people like those who write poetry or paint), and the geneology of the writers is clearly mentioned for all verses. No doubt, all these books and other scriptures are a store-house of Indian wisdom which is time-less. I believe that Sri Krishna is the hero of our mythology, like Sri Rama, Sita, Hanuman, Bheeshma, Ganesha, and thousands of others. It is from the mythology that a Hindu takes guidance about his conduct in life. If it was not for the mythology, our culture would not have survived. I bow to the idea of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna and so many others, because that has united the hindus in times of distress and given us strength to overcome it. I believe in 'Brahman', something which upanishads say is to be understood and not to be worshipped, like quantum fields and strings. It is the universal substrate which creates space and substance by its own inherent property. I have no objection to people being monotheists or monists, and they should not have any objection about anybody being an atheists or a polytheists. Being dogmatic and enemical to the belief of others is not Hinduism, how can anyone deny 'vipra bahudha vadanti' and call himself a Hindu? [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 17:41, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
:::If I may jump in...Hinduism accepts different beliefs and for this to be true, it should be inclusive of atheism. In fact, the paths to truth may be many - and atheism can well be one of them, by seeking truth purely by objective, scientific means or through an opposite belief of non-existence of god (or non-belief). However I am not implying that athiesm is a necessary part of being scientific, just that science does not rely on belief (as theism requires). If there is a truth which is infallible, perfect and all-powerful then it shouldn't matter if one believes in it or not - either way will lead one to the conclusion of that truth's existence and absoluteness...and the same applies to god. Yes, in the Gita, Krishna says the he is the source of all there is - but that in no way implies monotheism. It is simply an artistic way of saying that Krishna represents the vast cosmic energy from which all there is has been synthesised - that we contain that energy. It is simply a poetic way of saying what scientists say today - we are made of the same stuff that stars are made of. The matter for both came from pure energy when spacetime sprang forth from the big-bang singularity. [[User:Rohitbd|Rohitbd]] 13:09, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

The Gita obviously has many interpretations. It seems to inclined towards a theistic view. Krishna is more than the universe. He says, in chapter 10, verse 42, that He stands supporting the universe with a single fraction of His power. This supports a [[panentheistic]] view where God is more than the vast cosmic energy from which all there is has been synthesized.

===Atheistic views in hinduism===
thanks for your support aupmanyav. but it seems nobody else seems to agree. we can provide the legal sources, through which we could include nastiq philosophies in hinduism too. Such as Clause 2(b) of article 25 of Indian constitution says Buddhist and Jains to be Hindu. Buddhist and Jains are athiestic religions as there is no place for creationist god in their philosophy. other links for athiesm in traditional hinduism are [http://www.ece.mtu.edu/faculty/jeffc/students/sskaramp/second/atheism.html]
[http://www.darkfiber.com/atheisms/atheisms/hinsankyha.html]
[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/690490.cms]. also, Nastika in Hindu terms is related to non-believing of vedas, while atheism refers to non beleiving of existence of God. so, although Nastiq covers only Buddhism, Jainism and Charavaka for Hindu philosophy, athiesm covers nastiqs along with poorva mimamsa and sankhya. I can also not understand why are we not allowed to include buddha as ninth avatar of vishnu here, while our puranas are clear for that.  

This page just covers about Vaishnavism rather than Hinduism. All the six schools of thoughts covered here are generally considered vaishnavites (I may be wrong here). the current page seems to ignore shavist sects like [[Aghori]] as non-Hindus. This page, also, does not adequately covers Shaktism either. in my suggestion, we can do some redistribution of data here. Move some vaishnavism to its respective article and give a brief introduction to other aspects of hinduism like polytheism, athiesm, shaivism, shaktism which are all universally accepted parts of hinduism. hinduism also covers ''tamsiq'' ways of worships like alchohol being offered to shaivist deities like ''bhairon baba''.(there is a temple in pragati maidan, delhi where ''sharaab'' is offered to the god). there are also temples in nepal where eggs are offered to gods. infact shiva worship is more like tamsiq and it is completely condemned in this page. while as a hindu, we must respect all sects, including [[Aghori]]. 

Moreover, I could not find wikipedia policy which bans me from referring to other wikilinks.

You are right, nids. This article needs a thourough revision and the people who wrongly insist to restrict hinduism to philosophies of their liking have to give way. The only condition that Hinduism poses is that one should be a 'vipra', a person of good intention, one who fulfills his dharma to family and society. I suppose I am that. Tantra and Aghorapanth are valid philosophies in Hinduism, though they are not meant to be for everybody. There is however, no bar to put charlatans where they should belong. The best evidence that Hinduism is undefinable is from the latest case in Kerla High Court which refrained from defining a hindu.

Babub, please do not say that Vedanta is the main Hindu philosophy. You are likely to anger a whole lot of those who follow the teachings of Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Vallabhacharya and Sri Chaitanya. You are also not likely to please the Shaivites and the Shaktas either. Hindus have not remained united on the basis of such divisive thoughts.
Here is what Swami Sivananda said about them: 'All were great souls. We cannot say that Sankara was greater than Ramanuja or Vallabha was greater than Nimbarka. All were Avatara Purushas. Each one incarnated on this earth to complete a definite mission, to preach and propagate a certain doctrine, which was necessary to help the growth of a certain type of people who flourished at a certain period, who were in a certain stage of devotion. All schools of philosophy are necessary. Each philosophy is best suited to a certain type of people.'

I have been not seen the whole conseversation but babub is right that all listed are Vedantists. Ramanuja followed qualified monism, and Madhavacharaya followed dualism. It was a tradition of the Vedanta school to write three main commentaries on the Gita, Upanishads and the Brahma Sutras.

But it definately belongs to the article, and preferably on the intro, specially for those who consider them Hindus. As a further example, quite a few Sikhs keep their Hindu caste surnames like Bakshi, Ahluwalia etc. Similarly, if you attend a Jain marriage, you can simply observe that they remember their ''Gotra'' from their Hindu castes (though this is not allowed in either sikh or jains). their are definately some separatist groups everywhere.

:::Going after Wikipedia Notability, I found the conclusion mainly as &quot;Wikipedia should only publish material that is verifiable and is not original research.&quot; - (A whole article or a part.) '''Verifiability'''.

Besides this the LMS Report of about more than 60 years focusing Ayyavazhi. Many of them view Ayyavazhi outside Hinduism. Take care, the LMS Missionaries are of nagative views on Ayyavazhi. Which means, the vision on Ayyavazhi from LMS is a '''Vision from opposite pole on Ayyavazhi'''. So the LMS reports is the most valuable source in this matter. 

:::Over all, once the offline sources are considered, then the vision on Ayyavazhi will remain unbiased (for wiki).

To say Ayyavazhi as a seperate religion there are a number of publications from several Historians. They all infact noted that Ayyavazhi is still remaining as a sect within Hinduism. But noted a significant deviation of the beleif of Ayyavazhi people and the Ayyavazhi theology from Hinduism, saying it should be placed at a different pole from Hinduism. 

The book '''Religion and subaltern agency''' from '''University of Madras''' give a definite and clear vision in this matter. This is more valid because the fore most point of this reserch came from the top known 33 theologions from Ayyavazhi from Kanyakumari to Chennai. That university book itself say that Ayyavazhi theologions spread across these areas.

Another book on Tamil Nadu history from stone age to modern era - '''Thamizaka varalarum Panbadum''' (Tamil) (Author:V.T.Chellam) Says,  &quot;Ayyavazhi serves as a reform movement under sociology&quot; and going on telling the diversified nature of it and finally concluded Ayyavazhi as a seperate religion finally saying, &quot;Ayyavazhi religion gets originated&quot; (Tamil:அய்யாவழி சமயம் உதயமாகியது). 

In the book '''Sri Vaikunda Swamikal and the struggle for social equality in SouthIndia''' (Author:Dr.R.Ponnu) (Madurai Kamarajar University). The Conclusion of this study says &quot;The Followers of Sri Vaikunda Swamigal concentrated upon an '''independent system of worship''' and neglected the prevailing Hindu religious institutions.&quot; Going on, he say the diversifyied nature of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. The same author (as far as i've known) published some two or three more books on Ayyavazhi all focusing almost a same point. (&quot;Sri Narayanaswami Sect in Tamil Nadu&quot;, &quot;Vaikunda Swami:A case study of Socio-religious Awakening in South-India&quot;, &quot;Ayya Vaikundar oru Avatharam&quot; (Tamil) - all were reserch publications.  

In the book '''Land of Charity''' (Author:Samuel Mateer) this Ayyavazhi's were noted as &quot;this singular people display considerable zeal in the defence and propagation&quot; seeing them against the rest of Hinduism. 

And the LMS reports need not be considered as a valid source. But the missionaries were always anti- Ayyavazhi, saying Ayya as &quot;agent of satan&quot;, &quot;devil&quot; etc... But to verify the spread of Ayyavazhi could be seen from these repots of them. And hence they in such matters became valid enough. 

And overall the main reason for focussing Ayyavazhi outside Hinduism is, Ayyavazhi scriptures says that all the Hindu scriptures (Vedas, Sastras, Agamas, Puranas were all lost their substance right from the biggining of Kali Yuga. No other denominations inside Hinduism says so. Ofcourse, there may be different views between them. But they don't say the other gone awry. This was direct internal evidence for taking Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. But still Ayyavazhi accepts Hinduism for a certain period of Time (Until the end of Dwapara yuga). The view of Ayyavazhi on Hinduism seems to be like the view of Christianity to Judaism. 

In the matter of the number of worship centers In the research book &quot;Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sintanaiyum&quot; (Tamil) T.Krishna Nathan (for his project fro M.Phil degree, Madurai Kamarajar university) told, &quot;In regions of Tamil Nadu and Kerala there are more than 8000 pathis (Nizhal Thangals) is running. 

You asked me &quot;Do you honestly belive?&quot; So Iam qouting the following. These were not sources Iam citing. Patiently see each them. Not all of the following is my view. But different sociological views. All were in Tamil.

*[http://www.thinnai.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=20602109&amp;format=print&amp;edition_id=20060210]
*[http://www.thinnai.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=206022412&amp;format=html]
*[http://bhaarathi.net/ntmani/?p=214] - Though this is a common discussion, I feel there are some useful messages about Vaikundar. Read by serching the term  &quot;அய்யா&quot; and &quot;வைகுண்டர்&quot;. Here 
* [http://www.thinnai.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=20602176&amp;format=print] - Also here search the terms and read.

Then, on the basis of the number of followers Ayyavazhi is not equvalent (it doesn't mean that Ayyvazhi is not seperate religion) to Sikhism, Jainism etc. But theology, philosophy, mythology, religiosity etc... Ayyavazhi deviates faraway from Hinduism than these religions. 

Then in the matter of number of followers, since Ayyavazhi is not an officially recognised religion, there is no report from the side of government. But once I remember in a program in Sun Tv one person infromed this number as more than 7 lakhs (in 1997). Any way Iam not taking that as a citation. 

But '''Bala Prajapathi Adikalar''' the present considered leader of Ayyavazhi says in one of the interview that he was ready to sign a document for us, witnessing that there are more than 1000000 Ayyavazhi followers. If needed I shall Try to meet him and get a signed document. Don't think his is not notable, he was a state Award winner for communal harmony, and was a figure who laid foundation stones for more than 1000 Nizhal Thangals from across Kanyakumari to Mumbai.

Over all, Myself As an Ayyavazhi follower dislikes the reports of LMS, treats Vaikundar as &quot;Satan&quot; etc... But in such matters, on studying the religious infrastructure of Ayyavazhi, the negative view is important. Again telling, Don't throw them away. 

And in the case of Duriyothana, Mensturation cycle,etc... on my vision, if Ayyavazhi stands as a seperate religion, definitely it is notable and especially when the view of Ayyavazhi is different from others (certainly with citing the source) .

All people have a soft corner for their own people and prejudices for others, the whites and the non-whites, Japanese and the non-Japanese, christians and non-chiristians, the believers and the non-believers, the momin and the kafirs; if Aryans also thought that way, why should it surprise anybody, There is always a categorisation in any society, Europe also had such categorisation. Arya/Anarya division happened when the Aryans first came to India. After they mingled with the inhabitants of India, there were no Aryans, all became hindus. Bonded labour exists even now, and the people who control it are usually the newly powerful OBCs (Other Backward Classes, particularly the Jats and Yadavs), don't blame brahmins for it. If it was carried on during the British days, then the British also were a party to it. Slavery was even worse as practiced in muslim countries, in Europe and in America. You have not seen or read about true racism and aparthied as practiced by the whites in America and Africa, otherwise your views would have been much different. The Hindu caste system which was based on occupations, language, region of residence, food habits, traditions, has a large self-imposed component.

== Unfortunate ==

It is very unfortunate to include Hitler and Himmler in an article on Hinduism. What has hinduism to do with them?. They belong to the page 'Nazis', if Wikipedia has one for it. Secondly, how come Helena Blavatsky invades a page on Hinduism. She has nothing to do with Hinduism. Theosophy was an immature philosophy put out by a few westerners who thought they knew more than others and it perished with them. I suppose 'Theosophy' has its own page in Wikipedia.

I think it is wrong to mention that all hindus regard vedas as supreme and worship one brahmana, atleast in the introduction. as a fact [[Purva mimamsa]], [[Samkhya]] and [[caravaka]] did not worship any supreme being or brahmana. Amongst personalities, [[Veer Savarkar]] was an athiest and he is important because afterall, he was the one who coined the term [[Hindutva]]. i feel that it would be correct to remove the statement from the intro and move it inside the article and change it to say that most hindus do this (rather than saying all hindus).--[[User:Nidhishsinghal|nids]][[User_talk:Nidhishsinghal|(&amp;#9794;)]] 03:57, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

==&quot;oldest&quot;==
I am fed up with undifferentiated claims of &quot;ancient, oldest, 40000 BC&quot;. The Encarta article contains an informed summary of various historical stages. ''dharma'' was used as a term for the religion since the 7th century. 'Hinduism' may be considered to have originated from the 4th century BC. The [[Shrauta]] tradition within Hinduism may continue rituals that date to 1000 BC. The oldest textual tradition may reach back to as early as 1700 BC. Saying that &quot;the oldest textual tradition may reach back to as early as 1700 BC&quot; is '''''not''''' equivalent to stating &quot;Hinduism is the oldest religion&quot;. A properly phrased statement would read that 
:''parts'' (non-mainstream) of Hinduism are ''among'' the oldest ''surviving'' religious traditions.
The intro should either feature such an appropriately phrased statement, or refrain from touting Hinduism as &quot;oldest&quot; altogether. &quot;Hinduism is the oldest religion&quot; merely smacks of uneducated hype. We don't claim that Christianity goes back to [[Neolithic Europe]], even if ''parts'' of it (such as worship of Mary, such as [[Black Madonna]]s) do. If Hinduism has its roots in the Neolithic, so does every single religion on the planet. &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''ᛎ''')]]&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Dbachmann|qɐp]] 19:24, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

Dab, some of your points are valid but to comparing it with worship of Mary going back to Neolithic worship is a stretch. First, only Catholics venerate Mary. The worship of Mary should not be compared with a worship of a goddess. Mary is not worshipped as a goddess but only as an interceder on behalf on someone who prays to her in order to get God's grace and is not a goddess.Christanity has been around for 2000 years and to compare to neolithic worship is misleading. Neolithic generally means a period between 5000BC to 7000BC and Christianity did not exist at that time.
It is possible some form of Hinduism existed during the Neolithic time. Perhaps one could write oral tradition may have suggested that some form of Hinduism existed then but no verifiable written record to date has been found.

I'd have to agree with Baka here. Hinduism is often regarded as the oldest existing religion - the other main contender to this title is [[Zoroastrianism]]. [[user:BhaiSaab|BhaiSaab]] &lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:BhaiSaab|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:01, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

:It can be argued that elements of [[Christianity]] were borrowed from much older worship systems such as from the [[Ancient Egypt]]. There is strong evidence for the roots of the Christian worship in the Egyptian veneration of [[Isis]], [[Osiris]] and [[Horus]]. Does this mean we can claim that Christianity originated around 2500 BCE during the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]]? Similarly, the current day [[Hinduism]] has no resemblance to the worship systems followed by the Aboriginal or migrant communities of Ancient India. If it can be argued that the ''roots'' of Hinduism was from the prehistoric times then the same argument will hold for many other religions such as [[Buddhism]] and Christianity leading to endless arguments.

look, I wasn't suggesting that we insert the claim that Christianity has Neolithic roots in the ''intro'' of the Christianity article. Prehistoric pagan roots of Christianity may well be discussed, coherently and with clean references. Similarly, I recognize (read my comment!) that Hinduism comprises very old traditions. I did make a workable constructive suggestion:
:parts  of Hinduism are among the oldest surviving religious traditions.
I fully endorse this statement, and I agree that Hinduism is something special in this regard. Feel free to insert this statement anywhere you like. It is ''not'' acceptable to reduce it to mere &quot;Hinduism is the oldest religion&quot; which entails assumptions about all of the terms &quot;Hinduism&quot;, &quot;oldest&quot; and &quot;religion&quot;. It is very simple: If you want to state such a thing, you'll have to clearly say ''who'' is making that claim, per [[Wikipedia:Notability]]. Reputable sources will contain statements similar to those I made here, maybe containing superlative claims of &quot;oldest&quot; but always with some sort of qualification ('predecessor', 'roots' or similar). 1700 BC (to confine ourselves to ''textual'' tradition) is very old indeed for a ''surviving'' tradition, but of course religious traditions are known (notably Ancient Egyptian) that are significantly older, only they do not continue to be practiced today. Also note that possibly the only thing about contemporary mainstream Hinduism that ''may'' date to such early times is  the Gayatri mantra (minus the ''om bhur bhuvah svah'' part): viz., these are ''fragments'' of Hinduism, not Hinduism as a whole. &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''ᛎ''')]]&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Dbachmann|qɐp]] 07:11, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

This is ''not'' true because, [[Vedas]] are learnt ''in full'' (including Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva Veda) by innunmerable Hindus ([[Brahmin]]s) even today. FYI, I personally am learning (orally) the Taittiriya Shakha of the Krishna Yajur Veda and I know several others who have learnt ''orally'' the other Vedas ''in full'' too. You just can't sit in an [[Europe]]an ivory tower and flout such ridiculous claims. Because your &quot;reputation&quot; as a &quot;mainstream scholar&quot; will look ridiculous then and your prejudices are showing up. And mind you, [[Brahmin]]s are pretty much mainstream. 99% of all Hindus look up to Brahmins for religious guidance, much like how Christians do to Church fathers. So all the [[Vedas]] are mainstream today as far as learning them goes, but the observances mentioned in the Vedas may not be followed in full, but is this relevant here? 

::So Dab, believe me, such statements do flare up Hindus, and such scenes are better ''not'' seen on an encyclopedia. IMO that the Vedas are the oldest texts can be mentioned.

My comment on the Gayatri mantra referred to the 18th century BC date, which is, after all, almost another millennium earlier. The 'minus the om bhur bhuva' part of my comment made allowance that this part is ''younger'' (YV) than the Rigvedic 'tat savitr' part. I don't see your point at all, especially since I did grant the &quot;oldest&quot; moniker has some justification, it just needs to be put in some sort of context.

The internet is great for quick and dirty dissemination of text. But finding a lot of hits only proves that the topic has roused some debate in recent years. So I grant you that a google search shows that a lot of Hindus are eager to emphasize the antiquity of &quot;Hinduism&quot;. Gee, we knew that. The googlebomb simile also shows that a lot of people believe that G W Bush is a moron. Gee, we knew that as well. Such truisms don't make for factual statements in Wikipedia's voice. &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''ᛎ''')]]&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Dbachmann|qɐp]] 08:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
::::::holy ***! the &quot;oldest living city&quot; came from this very page. I've removed this statement before. It's simply not true. If any city has a claim of being the &quot;oldest living&quot;, it would be Jericho. Now it's one thing to insert false statements in good faith because you read them on some webpage. It's another thing to repeatedly sneak them in even after they were found out and removed as mistaken. Could people watching this page please show some integrity and and critical thinking? Otherwise, this sad article will ''never'' reach featured status. &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''ᛎ''')]]&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Dbachmann|qɐp]] 08:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

==Improving?==
Per the above discussion, any suggestions about improving this article? It was FA at one time, but now it is very poor in quality, though it has quantity. Vandalisms, edit wars have ruined it. That's why I asked an admin to make it semi-protected.

:the featuring process was questionable, it was never in a state that would pass FAC as it is now. You may go back to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&amp;oldid=3316512 original featured version], or the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&amp;oldid=69456939 version after Blacksun's extensive cleanup] and recover passages that have since deteriorated directly. &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''ᛎ''')]]&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Dbachmann|qɐp]] 16:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Linga Purana]] ==

This page pretty much is a translation of the text. Somebody has to shorten it. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[User:DaGizza|Gizza]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:DaGizza|Chat]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' &lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/DaGizza|&amp;#169;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:18, 31 August 2006 (UTC)


==Ekam Satviprahaa Bahudha Vadanti==
:&quot;Vadanti&quot; is bahuvaachak, right (Vadati, Vadatah, Vadanti Dhaatu Roop)? So should we use the singular &quot;it&quot; in the translation? Presently, the translation says Truth is one, though it is known by many names. Shouldn't it be as follows:

:&quot;The Truths are one, though they are said to be many&quot;.

::You have not kept the two words separate, &quot;Eko Sat, Vipra Bahudha Vadanti'. What you have forgotten in the translation is 'Vipra'. The author of the line is talking about 'good people', he is not talking about bad people. This is important, because bad people may give an intentional wrong description. Good people do not describe it as many, they describe it in many ways. So the correct translation is (IMHO) - 'One exists, good people describe it in various ways'.

::Per sanskrit dictionaries, Vipra means [[Brahmin]]. [[User:Babub|&lt;sup&gt;Babub&lt;/sup&gt;→]][[User talk:Babub|&lt;font color = &quot;DarkBlue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

::OK thanks. I see now that the bahuvaachak refers to Vipra. Does Vipra exclusively refer to Brahmins or all Dvijas?[[User:Subhash bose|Shiva&amp;#39;s Trident]] 00:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:The former. [[User:Babub|&lt;sup&gt;Babub&lt;/sup&gt;→]][[User talk:Babub|&lt;font color = &quot;DarkBlue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
::Check, Babub, Vipra like Arya also means a good, well-intentioned person. Then, it is not 'viprahaa', viprA itself is plural. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 06:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:Ok. There [http://muktaka.dyndns.org/ are] ''secondary'' meanings as you say. but the primary meaning as used in most sanskrit works is Brahmin. [[User:Babub|&lt;sup&gt;Babub&lt;/sup&gt;→]][[User talk:Babub|&lt;font color = &quot;DarkBlue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 08:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
::Agree. Shiva's Trident, Bahuvachan is for Vipras and not for Sat which, no doubt, is one. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] 02:12, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
