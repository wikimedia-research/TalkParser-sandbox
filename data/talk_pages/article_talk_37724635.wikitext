&lt;s&gt;[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Mark91|Mark91]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/37.136.67.216|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:God in Christianity]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Mark91|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Mark91|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Kristen ITC; color:blue&quot;&gt;Mark91&lt;/span&gt;]]'''''&lt;small&gt;[[User talk: Mark91|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;it's my world&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;''''' 20:39, 23 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:Sorry, my bad.--[[User:Mark91|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Kristen ITC; color:blue&quot;&gt;Mark91&lt;/span&gt;]]'''''&lt;small&gt;[[User talk: Mark91|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black;&quot;&gt;it's my world&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;''''' 20:42, 23 November 2012 (UTC)

::No, you were right to revert Mark. There were jokes hidden in that edit. It was vandalism in my view. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:04, 23 November 2012 (UTC)
