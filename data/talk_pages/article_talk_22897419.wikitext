== Youtube video ==

The youtube bit with Urpilainen is the only thing many people outside Finland know about Urpilainen, and gained the biggest short time popularity than any other Finnish video before it. It really is worth a mention, i think Jutta herself can live with it. After all, this is one of the things she will be remembered for decades to come.

And please, if you think something should be deleted because you don't like it, atleast give a proper reason and argue for the change, else we end up with chaos.

: [[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons]]: &quot;Biographies of living persons must be written conservatively, with regard for the subject's privacy. &lt;u&gt;Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid paper&lt;/u&gt;; it is not our job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives. The possibility of harm to living subjects is one of the important factors to be considered when exercising editorial judgment.&quot; --[[User:Pasixxxx|Pasixxxx]] ([[User talk:Pasixxxx|talk]]) 16:52, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
