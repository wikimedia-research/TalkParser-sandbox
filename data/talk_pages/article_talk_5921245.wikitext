== Broken external links ==

Both of the external links at the bottom are broken.

== POV: orthodoxy ==

The article currently reads:

&quot;While in his theology Witsius aimed at a reconciliation between orthodoxy and Covenant Theology (also known as federalism)...&quot;

As an adherent of Covenant Theology I believe CT is orthodoxy. I don't know anything about Witsius, so I don't know what to replace the word &quot;orthodoxy&quot; with. --[[User:S Roper|S Roper]] 00:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

== biblical theologian ==

As far as I know, [[Biblical Theology]] is something that is late 19th / early 20th century. Hence Witsius could never have been a Biblical Theologian. I propose to at least remove the link. Possibly to change

... he was first of all a Biblical theologian, his principal field being systematic theology.

Into

... he was first of all a Scriptural theologian, his principal field being systematic theology.

If no-one disagrees, I will change in two weeks time if I don't forget it.

Also I changed Leeuwaarden into [[Leeuwarden]] and Goesen into [[Goes]] and Wormeren in to Wormer.
