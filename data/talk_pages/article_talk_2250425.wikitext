== Three strip technicolor camera? ==

Acording to the trivia section of Suspiria in IMDB, that sort of camera has not been used since the 1950's. It states that the film was shot with a regular camera and filmstrip of the time and later developed in a three-strip machine.

It also gives the information as to why people are confused about that part of movie history. I just didn't edit the page right away as the person who wrote it may have a reliable source to make such a statement.

:I highly doubt that a production would willingly drag such a large beast of a camera (and a long-obsolete one at that) for a production in the 1970s when so many smaller, lighter, and better options were more easily accessible. Furthermore, the use of such a camera would make any handheld shots utterly impossible, as it would weigh several hundred pounds. I haven't seen ''Suspiria'', so I don't know if there are any handheld shots in it, though.

:What I will speculate is that the editor of these comments got it confused with the 3-strip imbibition process, which is a method of making release prints and is not at all incompatible with normal one-strip color photography. As Technicolor abandoned the process in 1975 and sold the equipment to the Chinese shortly thereafter, it would make more sense that this is what happened - it was filmed using normal cameras and film and then had separation masters made in order to strike IB prints. In any case, I've deleted the information until a citation can be found, as the claims are too highly improbable to accept without one.

: I checked the documentary on the special edition DVD, and cinematographer Luciano Tovoli definitely says it was printed in 3-strip Technicolor, NOT that it was filmed in this process.  The IMDb mentions that there is a shot of a 3-strip camera in the interview, but in fact the interview is fully illustrated with diagrams showing how a 3-strip camera worked, so no wonder many people got the wrong idea.

::Yes, I suppose that's bad (or no) research on the part of the docu crew! In any case, I've re-edited the article again after people seemed to revert it back. So let me clarify for anyone else reading - Technicolor generally refers to either of two processes: the actual camera negative or the release print made. The 3-strip negative stopped being used by the mid-1950s when Eastmancolor emerged, and was not really ever used again. The release print process, also known as dye transfer imbibition, was a method of making higher quality prints for cinemas. It was always used with the 3-strip negative process, but could also be used with normal 1-strip color negatives. In this process they separate the colors into three separation masters (RGB) which are then used to create three positive matrices (YCM). These are saturated with dye and each pressed into a blank frame in sequence, creating a dye transfer print. These prints are much higher in color and tonal rendition, and they don't fade (unlike most release prints which are based on photographic emulsion technology). This release print process continued to be used well into the 1970s before being stopped, and was briefly resurrected in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It does not require a 3-strip camera, and no movie made after the 1950s has used one. Including ''Suspiria''. [[User:Girolamo Savonarola|Girolamo Savonarola]] 21:19, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Just rewatching the movie. The ending credits of the movie list Eastmancolor and Technicolor, presumably filmed in Eastmancolor with the distribution prints processed in Technicolor.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.232.82.50|67.232.82.50]] ([[User talk:67.232.82.50|talk]]) 20:07, 14 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Public Domain ==

Does anyone know why this film is listed under the public domain category? -[[User:Aghost|Aghost]] 03:58, 3 December 2005 (UTC)
:It is listed on quite a few PD film distributor catalogs [http://www.desertislandfilms.com/drivein.html] [http://www.cinemainsomnia.com/cult.html]. As for how a film released in 1977 could be in the public domain already, there are two possible explanations: (A) It was not released with a copyright notice in the USA (B) There are lower quality prints, usually 16mm, that were released into the PD by the filmmakers to sell to second run theatres so the theatres could buy the print upfront and not have to pay royalties to screen it.--[[User:Fallout boy|Fallout boy]] 05:14, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
:The film is not and has never been in public domain in the United States. 20th Century Fox originally had distrubution rights to the film during the '70s and '80s, but they never renewed them after that (one could possibly blame that on the failure of Inferno). The film shuffled through many video distrubutors during the '90s until William Lustwig acquired the rights to the film at the end of the decade when Fox Lorber's rights expired. While the film is currently on license to Anchor Bay Entertainment, once it ends, the film will be released on Lustwig's Blue Underground label (which will be re-releasing most of Argento's films onto DVD within the next few years).&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:68.96.247.177|68.96.247.177]] ([[User talk:68.96.247.177|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/68.96.247.177|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Twist Ending ==

Can anyone tell me why this film is listed under the Twist Ending category? [[User:Pearce.duncan|Pearce.duncan]] 05:01, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Three Mothers, Part III==
According to IMDb, the third part of the Three Mothers series is in preproduction. I thought perhaps someone with a bit more motivation to update the article to reflect this, and perhaps even start an article on the new film.

==Italian language?==
Around the end of last year, I remember there being a list of several different languages under &quot;language&quot; in the infobox, which I assumed to be the different languages spoken by the actors on-set given their varied ethnicities, and then it was changed to only Italian. How is the language of the film Italian if some of the main actors (including Jessica Harper and Joan Bennett) are clearly speaking English? I'm no lip reader, but it's quite clear some of the others are too. Are we talking language of first dubbing here or what? I'll admit that I don't even know what language the script was written in given Daria and Dario are both Italian and not native English speakers, but I'm unsure as to what exactly the infobox language is referring to.
