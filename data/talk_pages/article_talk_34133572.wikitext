== Cue Cat suggestions ==
Hello Binksternet
I see you have made comments and changes to the cue cat record.  I have put up for review suggestions for relevant changes to the cue cat record.  Would you please join in with the rest of us on the suggested changes?  Thank you (ProofPlus Professional Researcher 19:48, 2 November 2011 (UTC))  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Proofplus|Proofplus]] ([[User talk:Proofplus|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Proofplus|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Thank each of you, wiki editors and such, for giving me such great pointers and also for the direct emails of encouragement in learning this process.

== Edit To Classical Music ==
Hi there.  Please help me understand why you had removed my edit for vandalism and copyrighted material.

I posted no copyrighted material, just a link.  I thought it was a shame that the only external link was available to EU members.

All the same, just trying to help.  Cheers!

:I looked at the site and it appeared to me to use copyrighted recordings. Wikipedia cannot link readers to websites that violate copyright laws. 
:Other than that, I did not see any specific encyclopedic information about classical music. [http://www.kickassclassical.com/classical-music-popular-famous-best-top-100-list.html The link] only listed the top 100 classical songs by some unstated algorithm of how much the songs were used in popular media such as TV and movies.

== grand lake theater edit ==

Hello Binksternet,

I've only done a few Wikipedia edits.  I just saw you remove most of the addition I did for the Oakland Grand Lake theater Politics section.

There is a reason for putting down the full transcript from Rachel Maddow's brief coverage which you deleted.

The Oakland Grand Lake Theater has not been given preferential treatment by the City of Oakland as an important landmark.  If anything Oakland Mayor Quan has deliberately introduced anti-small business measures to starve small businesses Oakland and has particularly ignored the owner of the Grand Lake Theater when she was just a councilmember.

The full transcript of Rachel's comments I think is really important for anyone who is looking at the wiki entry for the GrandLake theater because it will give readers a really good idea of just why the Oakland grand lake theater is such a gem.

Frankly I know that Allen Michaan would really appreciate having the full transcript included in the wiki entry, I just spoke with him tonight.

Is there some reason why you took out the text?  I currently live in SF and I grew up about a mile away from the Grand Lake theater and as such really appreciate Allen's guts to post the messages on his marquee.

I can give you  my cell ph if that helps you.  

Best regards,

Katie  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Katt123|Katt123]] ([[User talk:Katt123|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katt123|contribs]]) 04:20, 7 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:First, you would want to know that I love the Grand Lake—I am a loyal theater customer as well as a neighbor. When I look out of my living room window I see the big rooftop sign backwards spelling DNARG. Second you might want to know I am just trying to keep the article neutral and fact-based rather than promotional. Wikipedia is not here to help local organizations gain notice, it is here to document such notice as gained by other means. Michaan has options open to him, avenues of promotion, but Wikipedia cannot be one of them. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not more than that.

== Thanks ==

A belated thank you for taking the time to fully explain the review process to me.  I first saw Warren on the Now PBS program several years ago and was impressed with her intelligence and clear thinking.  You really did a great job on her article.

I lived in CA for several years - Palo Colorado Canyon just up from Garapata Beach, just north of the Rainbow Bridge. I spent some time at Esalen as well. It is a beautiful place and I have very fond memories of that area.  

Also, it is good to see you at the OWS article - it needs good editors like you and I hope you continue to spend a little time there. [[User:Gandydancer|Gandydancer]] ([[User talk:Gandydancer|talk]]) 14:13, 7 November 2011 (UTC)

::Yes, I sure did.  I also saw [[sea sailors]], and luminescent sand fleas.  Each step in the wet sand brought out hundreds of sparkles - it was one of the most beautiful experiences that one could have...  I spent a lot of time near the ocean and used to work the 3 - 11 shift so that I drove home, down the coast, each night.  On moonlit nights...well, you can just imagine... I used to drive the old coast road that takes off above Rainbow Bridge...beautiful rolling hills of California poppies and lupine...  I lived right in the redwood forest in a dome with windows all around.  I was there for the...was it '89?...quake.  The dome was on stilts and it used to sway back and forth all night as the many aftershocks rolled through... In some ways I regret leaving, but my two girls were starting their families and I missed them. [[User:Gandydancer|Gandydancer]] ([[User talk:Gandydancer|talk]]) 16:58, 14 November 2011 (UTC)

== Binksternet can you help me? ==

Binksternet can you help?

I posted to Cue cat as I said I would.  Once again Bbb23 undid my work as he has done to all other.   But in the process of dismantleing my work he left out the Codie Ward for cue cat.  Would you look over my links for the award and consider improving the file of cue cat on my behalf for the codie award?  Seems, me being new and female is hurting me.  Can you help improve the cue cat file?  I have left the links and info in the discussion page.

== Random request ==

I've run into your name a few places and I have a random request due to your GA experience. I have listed [[death panel]] as my first GAN. I'm slightly concerned it may be rejected due to a lack of a formal copy-edit. (I've tried my best to copy-edit and compress the physician/academics/politicians reaction and analysis, as the peer review suggested.) Might you take a quick look and give a bit of feedback on the article in case there are some potentially deal-breaking changes I can make before it is reviewed? Thanks. [[User:Jesanj|Jesanj]] ([[User talk:Jesanj|talk]]) 23:34, 8 November 2011 (UTC)

:I will take a look when I get time. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet#top|talk]]) 00:00, 9 November 2011 (UTC)

A few thoughts: The very first sentence makes no sense. Not a promising start! The rest of the article is not neutral in tone, that is, too much promotion for HR 3200. The word &quot;reform&quot; is used to beat the reader over the head, even though it refers to a proposed bill. [http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cache/wikipedia:en:Death_panel#view=0,0,0,0,1,1 There are three dead URLs]. The article is too repetitious about the concept of death panels being false. Once established, the point does not have to be continually repeated. I don't like the two horizontal galleries of influential parties. If they are not major actors such as Palin and Gingrich then their presence is undue weight. Why is there a wikilink to [[job-killing]]?

== [[Buster Keaton]] ==

Thanks for going in and rectifying the addition of &quot;stuntman&quot; to Keaton's résumé. Actually I think he did stunts on occasion, but I have no citation for that at present. Maybe it is in one of his bios or an interview, but I'm certain he did work as a stuntman now and again. He is simply not notable for it. Good catch.

:Now I'm curious about his stunt work for others. ^_^
:[[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet#top|talk]]) 20:20, 10 November 2011 (UTC)

Sorry, it looks as though I abandoned you... all I can do is make mention of stuff I have known since childhood. All I know is Arbuckle and Schenck naturally found him to be the best stuntman available. He was generally kept from wasting his time that way, but he'd do it if he liked the project.

This reminds me of Ebert, just writing last Friday. He asked stars why they did cruddy films, when they were stars and it was embarrassing. They said because they needed the money for something or other, and because no one would ever really 'see' them in the lousy films anyway....

Sorry, I just never had enough time to read enough about Buster, but I got to see him when I was a kid with my parents and that has always been more than enough for me!

I have to also ask that you quit lying. The Business Insider article was ''not'' copyrighted.

Dear Binksternet
Thank so much for the barnstar! Much appreciated, and it is wonderful to see that someone else here sees that there is something very disturbing about that page. Unfortunately, there is still much work to be done with that page, especially the passage that seems to imply that all Soviet Jews were Communists, which is why they did not deserve &quot;lenient&quot; treatment, which is deeply troubling. I'm going to attach a neurality tag on that article until that matter is sorted out. But in the meantime, thank so much and please have a wonderful day!--[[User:A.S. Brown|A.S.

:::Thanks so much for all the good work on the Manstein article. I've been sick for the last week or so, so please excuse my inactivity as of late. Without mentioning any names, there are some users that depress one because one tries to make an article reflect recent historical work by bringing in proper sources, and then one has to engage in a knock-down battle. This is the kind of thing that makes one want to keep up on Wikipedia. Yes, some of the material that I'll brought in was unflattening, but that is not my fault that Manstein went and did things like massacre Jews. If Manstein wanted to have a better reputation, then he should have refrained from doing that sort of thing. It is really depressing that somebody in this day and age wants to keep alive the mythological reputation that Manstein created for himself in the 1950s, something that historians should not have believed even at the time, and no serious historian believes today. But then there are users like you, who are intelligent, courteous and fair, and gives one hope that in a format like Wikipedia, there are good people still out there.

== Phase equalization ==

''In most non-audio applications the actual [[waveform]] of the transmitted signal must be preserved, not just its frequency content. Thus these equalizing filters must also cancel out any phase shifts (unequal delay) between different frequency components.''

You deleted the above from [[equalization]] stating that it was &quot;unlikely&quot;.  The article already explains why this is necessary in analogue television.  It is also important in digital communications (which probably justifies &quot;most&quot; but &quot;many&quot; might be better).  In fact dispersion was the limiting factor of early submarine telegraph cables.

:I'm not seeing what you're seeing in the article body. The bit about dispersion is not very clear, if that's supposed to explain the concept.
:Sounds like you are describing a system that pre-equalizes a signal prior to the signal traveling through an all-pass sort of medium in which the phases are smeared. If so, it's not just television: there are audio tools for this same purpose because air does not affect all sound waves equally. Air attenuates high frequency sound waves more than low and it smears the phase. Some loudspeaker management tools for large concerts have a way to counteract this condition. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet#top|talk]]) 22:41, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

::Dispersion is referred to in the body at [[Equalization#Television lines]].  I was not particularly referring to pre-equalization.  Whether it is pre or post equalization is irrelevant to this discussion (obviously it has to be pre for a loudpeaker system).  Phase distortion is a cause of [[intersymbol interference]] in digital communications.

::Your comment ''Air attenuates high frequency sound waves more than low and it smears the phase'' is a little confused.  The differential attenuation of frequencies is not dispersion, it is rather, the differential ''delay'' of frequencies.  Dispersion of sound in air is a relatively minor effect (see [[speed of sound]]) and does not have a hugely detrimental result.  In digital communications, on the other hand, it has the potential to completely destroy reception.

::::::Since I am not an encyclopedia I couldn't give you a list of ''all'' of them.  The one I am most familiar with is analogue television, it is vital to phase equalise cables carrying analogue pictures.  As I said above, phase equalisation is widely used in digital modems which would not be able to operate at such high data rates without it because of intersymbol distortion.  That in itself must cover a huge range of applications.  Radar systems use it to preserve the radar pulse shape.  I have a reference which suggests the earliest equaliser may have been a phase equaliser used on a sonar system, but I wouldn't quote that in the article - while the source is Sidney Darlington he is a little vague about it.

::::Swarm, the 24:01 difference was simple chance. I have made more than 68,000 edits on Wikipedia so naturally two article reversions might be 24:01 apart. I happened to be sitting down at the computer at about the same time on two successive nights, looking at the ''[[Maafa 21]]'' article to see what was useful and what needed changing. As always, I had multiple browser windows open, all relating to articles I have on my watchlist, ones that had changed recently. One was the ''Maafa 21'' article contribution history. Another was the article talk page. I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMaafa_21&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=461062565&amp;oldid=432936336 added the abortion sanctions 1RR template] to the talk page, hit 'save page' at 04:27, and then I closed that browser window, revealing the revision history of ''Maafa 21'' which I examined for past editors, to see if there had been any useful prior content contributions that had been subsequently deleted, or whether there were earlier contributors worth talking to. I noticed that [[User:Lifedynamics]] was already warned and blocked for username violations, being the same name as the film production company. The next edit I made was to click on [[User:Maafa21]] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Maafa21&amp;action=history give him a similar warning] about username policy. The next handful of open browser windows that I dealt with took about 45 minutes of my time but I was getting sleepier, and after [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Twain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=461066769 removing a possibly misleading inflation number] from the Mark Twain biography I was about to shut the computer off for the night. Before doing so I remembered the ''Maafa 21'' article, opened it up and examined it for anything worth keeping, made the now fateful revert, and went to bed. There was no sense of gaming the system on my end, no drumming of fingers and watching the clock to make sure I was not breaking 1RR. There was only, oh, hey, I forgot to actually edit the article after sifting through its page history.
::::When NYyankees51 showed me the diffs on my talk page it was the first time I saw the 24:01 time span. I thought, oh, it looks like I got lucky and missed 1RR by a minute. I thought that, because of the minute leeway, I would not have to take any remediating action—would not have to defend myself. If I had felt guilty of gaming at that point I would have done something about it. Let me reiterate that I held no intention of gaming the system.

I was giving you an opportunity to self-revert and remedy the situation. Instead, you defiantly acknowledged that the 1 minute was intentional.

:::You seem to be operating under the impression that a poor image is better than no image. I disagree. At [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Content]], the guideline says that images should &quot;increase readers' understanding of the subject matter.&quot; I don't think most of the sculpture images do that. Instead, they serve to derail topic comprehension, taking the reader away from the article to try and figure out what is being depicted in the unclear photograph, to try and figure out what kind of thinking went into the sculpture. It is true that intangible concepts such as [[pseudoscience]] can be illustrated with images, but in many cases the photos you are adding do not help.

On October 7, WikiProject Conservatism was [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject Conservatism|nominated for deletion]] by member [[user:Binksternet|Binksternet]]. He based his rationale on what he described as an undefinable scope, stating that the project is &quot;at its root undesirable&quot;. Of the 40 participants in the discussion, some agreed that the scope was problematic; however, they felt it did not justify deletion of the project. A number of participants suggested moving the project to &quot;WikiProject American conservatism&quot;. The overwhelming sentiment was expressed by [[user:Guerillero|Guerillero]] who wrote: &quot;A project is a group of people. This particular group does great work in their topic area[,] why prevent them from doing this[?]&quot; In the end there was negligible opposition to the project and the result of the discussion was &quot;Keep&quot;. The proceedings of the deletion discussion  were picked up by ''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2011-10-17/News and notes|The Signpost]]'', calling the unfolding drama &quot;the first MfD of its kind&quot;. ''The Signpost'' observed that attempting to delete an active project was unprecedented. The story itself became a source of controversy which played out at the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2011-10-17/News and notes#Wikiproject Conservatism MfD|Discuss This Story]] section, and also at the {{Plainlink|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJorgenev&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=456469755&amp;oldid=456159509|name=author's talk page}}. 

Two days after the project was nominated, the [[P:RIGHT|Conservatism Portal]] was also [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Portal:Conservatism|nominated for deletion]] as &quot;too US-biased&quot;. There was no support for deletion amongst the 10 participants, with one suggestion to rename the portal.

In other news, a [[s:Portal:Conservatism|new portal]] focusing on conservatism has been created at WikiSource. Wikisource is an online library of free content publications with 254,051 accessible texts.

Seven of the eight new members joined after October 12; the deletion discussions may have played a role in the membership spike.

Timeline of conservatism, a Top-importance list, was [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Timeline of conservatism|nominated for deletion]] on October 3. The nominator stated that since conservatism in an &quot;ambiguous concept&quot;, the timeline suffers from original research. There were a number of &quot;Delete&quot;, as well as &quot;Keep&quot; votes. The closing administrator reasoned that consensus dictated that the list be renamed. The current title is [[Timeline of modern American conservatism]].

== Recent Steinway edit ==

I see that the Steinway article continues to be bizzarely dynamic and controversial. You recently removed a clause that denoted the company's practice of importing some of their product line from overseas suppliers. Because of the beginning of the sentence focusing on the somewhat unique hand assembly process used on American and German Steinways, this did change the meaning of the sentence and make it less complete as a descriptor of the company and its business. I do not see why the national origin of those non hand-made imports is at all relevant (and in this day, is undoubtedly prone to change), but would it not be more accurate to not imply by the current form of this passage that Steinway sells only hand-made pianos (which is how I read the net of your edit)?--[[User:Rwberndt|Rwberndt]] ([[User talk:Rwberndt|talk]]) 13:46, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

== Falsetto article corrections ==

Hi Binksternet

I am a professional singer based in England. I was surprised at how many factual errors were in the Falsetto article.

You were referring to literature which is very old, and has since been found to be inaccurate. I have taught singing for my whole life, and am in touch with very important authorities on matters of the voice (for example Mr Mansel V Griffiths, FRCS http://www.expertsearch.co.uk/cgi-bin/find_expert?2275, founder of the first voice clinic in the UK).

I would like to make alterations to the Falsetto page as it is currently very misleading. Unfortunately there are not many references as the internet (and also many books) are full of misleading misinformation (which people like Mr Griffiths have no time to correct). For example the animation refers to the phonation of the vocal chords (not falsetto at all). Another problem is Falsetto has nothing to do with vocal chords, instead the sound is created by the vibration of false folds above the vocal chords. The article also mixes up the history of castrato singing with falsetto. Obviously the two are very different (in addition to being very different from the technique of counter tenors)!

I’m not sure how invested you are in this article – I would appreciate you at least considering my amendments, and allow me to replace or remove any inaccurate information. Although some of the information is referenced, the references themselves are outdated and the ideas have been disproved and replaced.

Regards

:I am ''not'' heavily invested in the article, but for what it's worth, Wikipedia goes by published sources, not by personal observations. The guideline at [[WP:No original research]] describes how Wikipedia cannot be the first place that an idea is published. If there are no published and reliable sources correctly describing falsetto physiology, the article cannot tell the reader what your conclusions are.

==Maunsel White / Elliott Cresson Medal Recipients==
Dear Binksternet, On the [[Maunsel White]] article I removed the category tag that listed White as a recipient of the [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] because that was actually a different (but related) Maunsel White.  

The following PDF article from Louisiana State University mentions the link between the original Maunsel White (the one who has an article on Wikipedia) and his grandson, Maunsel White III (the one who won the Cresson medal, and who no doubt deserves a Wikipedia article): http://www.bus.lsu.edu/bedeian/articles/MaunsellWhite-NO1988.pdf

However, I cannot figure out how to prevent the reference to Maunsel White on the page listing Elliott Cresson Medal recipients from automatically linking to the article for the wrong Maunsel White.  Do you know how to fix this?  See the reference to Maunsel White here:

== LRAD ==

Another editor removed the modified LRAD sentence, pointing out (quite correctly) that it's out of place in a section about complaints by local residents.  I restored it, but put it in the &quot;Police Reponse&quot; section, where it will not imply a SYNTHy &quot;response&quot; to the resident complaints about noise.  I also clarified the sources -- if you read carefully, it appears that no one, even the protesters who tweeted, claimed that the police used the LRAD as anything other than super-loud megaphones to broadcast police instructions to protesters. (The closest anyone came was one protester claiming that the devices are &quot;usually used in combat&quot; and pointing out that they're ''capable'' of emitting loud tones to drive people away.  No one actually says the NYPD did that.)

== Requesting advice/assistance ==

I'm still rather green at the whole wikipedia thing. I'm not sure how to link specific edits, but if you look at my talk page, you will see that my recent edit on Steinway seems to have attracted the attention of our IP friend who supports other pianos in a rather aggressive and most unwelcome manner. Can you help me to understand where I go when another editor has edited my user page in a slanderous manner, asserting that I work for Steinway, when in fact I work for an automaker and have played Yamaha [[euphonium]]s (flunked class piano twice !!) since 1976 and have no such affiliation? It amazes and disturbs me that the Steinway article is so dynamic. With Samick, a company with a past history of procuring old, respected names and assigning them to new sources possibly in the process of acquiring what has been a generally respected piano maker, I would expect this in the near future, but now? Anyway, I tried to make light of it and dont feel a simple deletion in the logs speaks well to my side (the truth), but I really feel that what this user did on my user talk page was unacceptable, but do not know the wikiprotocol to follow to object. Can you enlighten me?--[[User:Rwberndt|Rwberndt]] ([[User talk:Rwberndt|talk]]) 00:52, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

:The answer is that I don't know. The real problem is how to shut down the IP editor who appears unable to edit the page without a little twist of the negative knife. The article can be semi-protected but your talk page and mine will continue to be available to this guy's accusations. (Check my talk page history for the IP comment I deleted.) Blocking the IP would solve all of the problems, but I don't see exactly what leverage to use on him, what specific guidelines he's breached beyond [[WP:NPOV]] at the article and fairly mild [[WP:NPA]] at our talk pages.

I saw your recent and 100% correct on the Moore article.  I made that same type of edit a few months back and his minions shredded it.  Hope it stays in, but his followers don't like anything remotely resembling verifiable facts in that article.  It's probably the only BLP that uses the subject as a source, too.--[[User:Mike Searson|'''Mike''']] - [[User_talk:Mike_Searson|'''Μολὼν λαβέ''']] 19:18, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

:Oh well. I was surprised that two of my source books were not in the article yet, one something of a puff piece and the other sharply critical, as epitomized by the &quot;Big Fat Stupid White Man&quot; title. You know, the text about Moore's NRA membership is somewhat less appropriate in his biography article and quite a bit more appropriate in the ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' article.

== 92.x ==

Hi Binksternet - this 92.x guy is becoming a real problem - given his track record, I'm assuming every edit he makes is dubious and needs to be reverted.  You think it's time to ask for an IP range block?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:80%;font-family:Tahoma;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;[[User:The Red Hat of Pat Ferrick|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''The Red Hat of Pat Ferrick'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt; [[User talk:The Red Hat of Pat Ferrick|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''t'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 00:55, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
:That IP is actually community banned editor {{vandal|HarveyCarter}}, articles relating to the Suez Crisis are a particular target of his. As he's banned, he can (and should) be reverted on sight without regard to 3RR. As you've already noticed he hops IPs all the time, so it's generally best to ask for pages semi-protecting to deal with his disruption. Playing whack-a-mole with dynamic IP editors can be handled using SPI, but page protection is much easier for persistent and committed sockmasters. &lt;font face=&quot;Celtic&quot;&gt;[[User:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006600&quot;&gt;2 lines of K&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;''[[User talk:One Night In Hackney|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006600&quot;&gt;303&lt;/span&gt;]]''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:48, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

:The notional rangeblock would have to cover at least 92.7.0.0 to 92.7.31.255, if not wider. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rab_Butler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=417272106 This edit] from 92.7.241.136 might have been our guy Harvey.) That kind of rangeblock would inconvenience as many as 8,000 IP addresses. It's perhaps better to keep reinstating protection for the relevant articles than to permanently block so many IPs, many of which I imagine are public or dynamic. The possible collateral damage to beneficial editors must be gauged. I, for one, am in favor of putting a halt to anonymous IP editing, but this is not the place for such advocacy.

Hi B. There are too many redlinks (deadlinks) and I think we have too many wikified titles in the TV section, and in the entire article actually. I think we should turn ''all'' Keaton's titles into a list, easy to read, reference and wikify when applicable. It ought to be in the form of a list instead of this awful mess ''that is nearly impossible to edit''. A form of this message was posted at the talk page, but I wanted your input and help in this. Imagine how it would beautify and streamline the article! All we'd have to do is create the columns and move the text there; I'm short on time for columns but I'd be willing to do the rest if someone would do the columns and make a few title/text moves to the columns. :D [[User:Djathinkimacowboy|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800080&quot;&gt;'''Djathink'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Djathinkimacowboy|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'''imacowboy'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 16:14, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

== Rude action ==

hello,

before you revert&lt;s&gt;ing&lt;/s&gt; anything, you need to read our guidelines before perfoming a revert. Please read [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment]] carefully; I give you one example of text which is of high importance:

''It is vital that people do not take these assessments personally. It is understood that we each have our own opinions of the priorities of the objective criteria for a perfect article. Generally an active project will develop a consensus, though be aware that different projects may use their own variation of the criteria more tuned for the subject area, such as this. Many projects have an assessment team. If you contribute a lot of content to an article you may request an independent assessment.''

Hi. Just a quick reminder that [[WP:Edit warring|edit warring]] is not a good idea. Just because it is being carried out on a talk page doesn't stop it [[WP:3RR|being edit warring]]. If you disagree with the source then engage in discussion with the IP editor rather than repeatedly reverting their attempt at contributing. The talk page isn't an article, the claim may not be true but it isn't causing any harm because it isn't in the article at the moment. After repeatedly adding the source to the article, the IP editor decided to start a discussion on the talk page.

Hello, Binksternet, I disturb You as I do think that the table with the kills of Litvyak should be deeply corrected if not deleted at all. I have just published today the most updated book about Soviet airwomen, with the newest and unpublished data and information about Litvyak available on the market. There is absolutely - for instance - no evidence that Litvyak on 16 july shot down a German ace. That day the Luftwaffe Experten listed in the teble belly landed for an engine failure subsequently an air fight. Now, this is NOT a kill. Moreover, there is only one source - Pennington, pag. 140 - that states that Litvyak that day scored a kill, while Cottam (Women in War and Resistence) writes that Litvyak that day had just to belly land. But there is absolutely no proof that anyway the German ace was hit by Litvyak, as there is not known any claims record on Litvyak side where is noted exactly the Planquadrat Koordinaten or the exact point of any of her air victory. Still, on 1st of August 1943, the Jagdeschwaders engaged along the Mius front had not aircraft damaged and Litvyak was not the one who &quot;taran&quot;ned Merkle, as no one of the witness saw and says that. So I propose to delete those unaccurate credited victories.

::If you check spanish edition you'll see that information is included as a version, not as something probed. It's a controversial matter added in the introduction of the english article in an artful way. (Note the words &quot;Matos' carnival march&quot;, devaluing the author of the piece).

I guess I was not clear at all with my reversion and my explanations: did you notice the article already includes two times the last text inserted? And it was inserted for the same user, if you check history. 
A little article with the same text, basically, included THREE times and by the same user? I wonder why. -- [[User:Fixertool|Fixertool]] ([[User talk:Fixertool|talk]]) 14:52, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

== Active Noise Control ==

I'm no physicist, but I happened to notice the debate at [[Active noise control]] (doing some audio research) and it appears Wikifiximprove is correct. At about 340 m/s, 500Hz works out to a little over 2 feet in one wavelength. I've been acused of having a swelled head, but . . . . I think the 5000Hz figure looks believable. What is frustrating is that this is a classic example of a useful article and a potentially excellent analogy for making the subject understandable, that is unsourced - in either form.--[[User:Rwberndt|Rwberndt]] ([[User talk:Rwberndt|talk]]) 22:01, 22 December 2011 (UTC)

:I found a reference for 800 Hz, so my 500 and the other guy's 5000 were both wrong. ^_^

== edit References to Pseudoscience Should Be Moved to Historical Footnotes ==

Query to the scientific community:

To the Directors of Physics Departments,

LENR - Low Energy Nuclear Reaction and Widom Larson Theory, aka Condensed Matter Nuclear, historically misnamed &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; 

1) Is this science or pathological science? 
2) Do you offer a class in this discipline? If so, please provide information. 
3) Are you developing a curriculum of this science? If so, when will you offer it? 
4) What peer review journals do you source in this field?

Binksternet sir,
P&gt;S&gt; 
1) Any suggestions before I move forward with this?
2) Is this direction of query able to yield opinions the Wikipedia forum on Cold Fusion may value?

Thank you for your time,

== Welcome to the 2012 WikiCup ==

Hello, and welcome to the [[Wikipedia:WikiCup|2012 WikiCup]]! The competition officially begins at the start of 2012 (UTC) after which time you may begin to claim points. Your submission page, where you must note any content for which you wish to claim points, can be found '''[[Wikipedia:WikiCup/History/2012/Submissions/Binksternet|here]]''', and formatting instructions can be found in hidden comments on the page. A bot will then update the main table, which can be seen on the WikiCup page. The full rules for what will and will not be awarded points can be found at [[Wikipedia:WikiCup/Scoring]]. There's also a section on that page listing the changes that have been made to the rules this year, so that experienced participants can get up-to-date in a few seconds. One point of which we must remind everyone; you may ''only'' claim points for content upon which you have done significant work, and which you have nominated, ''in 2012''. For instance, articles written or good article reviews started in 2011 ''are not'' eligible for points.

This round will last until late February, and signups will remain open until the middle of February. If you know of anyone who may like to take part, please let them know about the comeptition; the more the merrier! At the end of this round, the top 64 scorers will progress to the next round, where their scores will reset, and they will be split into pools. Note that, by default, you have been added to [[Wikipedia:WikiCup/Newsletter/Send|our newsletter list]]; we will be in contact at the end of every month with news. You're welcome to remove yourself from this list if you do not wish to hear from us. Conversely, those interested in following the competition are more than welcome to add themselves to the list. Please direct any questions towards the judges, or on the WikiCup talk page. Good luck!
