== Differences between fairytale and film ==

I removed this section because 1) it is completely uncited, 2) if it were cited, it should go in to the film article, and 3) it is a list of [[WP:TRIVIA|miscellaneous information]]. [[User:Cactusjump|Cactusjump]] ([[User talk:Cactusjump|talk]]) 22:25, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

 Princess aurora should be Ukrainian or Russian al.Le its origins are obvious as the story originates from the French perrault but the classic work was written by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and the setting is undoubtedly a landscape of Eastern Europe

== Inconsistent Creator Credits  ==

On this article under the photo of Aurora, the Brothers Grimm are given credit for creating this character. If one looks at the articles, though, for both [[Sleeping_beauty|Sleeping Beauty]] and the [[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|1959 film by Disney]], Charles Perrault is credited. Perrault's narrative is outlined in the first article and is used as a reference point for the other variants. It even states that the Brothers Grimm almost did not include the story in their collection (they did so in consideration of the existence of Brynhild).  
Perrault is acknowledged as the original fairy tale writer in the credits for the film by Disney, including a statement that Disney used Perrault and Tchaikovsky's symphony to create the film. The only possible reason that the Brothers Grimm are considered to be the creators is in the first article where it states the Brothers Grimm story was called ''Briar Rose''. Perrault, though, used the name Aurora for the daughter of Sleeping Beauty. Disney chose to use both names for the character in the film. 
If there are other articles in Wikipedia that credit Charles Perrault's involvement in this character, then he needs at least to be added as a creator on this article in addition to the Brothers Grimm if not made the only creator.

== Cinderella and Aurora photos ==

Now that Cinderella is being shown in her original dress colors here on Wikipedia I think Aurora should be shown in the colors she was advertised in. On her page at Disney wikia, she is wearing a blue dress. That was the color of the dress she had for most of her original film and it's even the color of her dress in the [[Kingdom Hearts]] series. She was also originally advertised wearing blue. Look at these VHS tapes. [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7WQST4JL._SY300_.jpg] [http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTE=/z/kv0AAOSw7PBTofoz/$_35.JPG] Plus, there are these theatrical release posters. [http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131219054505/disney/images/5/5f/Sleeping_Beauty_1990's_Re-Release_Poster.jpg] [http://www.pastposters.com/cw3/assets/product_full/(PB)__SleepingBeauty-1980(1)front.jpg] She also used to wear it in Disney parks. Heck at the El Capitan Theatre in 2008, she is even advertised wearing blue in the marquee. [http://www.dvdizzy.com/images/q-s/sbelcap-01.jpg] If we are instead going to base it on the colors, they are being advertised in now, then Cinderella's dress should not be silvery white if Aurora's is pink.

: I visited Aurora's photo page and I noticed the drama that was going on. I saw the drama that was happening and you have very good points. A few months ago, Disney's official fan club, [[D23]], even did a poll and they voted that the dress should actually be blue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://d23.com/poll-pink-or-blue/ Are You Team Pink or Team Blue?]&lt;/ref&gt; So, I do believe that we should show her in her blue dress.
