A tag has been placed on '''[[:El mercado de los angeles]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#G11|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an acceptable page. Please read [[WP:GCSD|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item G11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this page is not blatant advertising, [[File:Speedy delete contest button.svg|link={{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:El mercado de los angeles}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}}]]. Clicking that button will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[{{TALKPAGENAME:El mercado de los angeles}}|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. You are welcome to edit the page to fix this problem, but please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. As well as removing promotional phrasing, it helps to add factual encyclopaedic information to the page, and add [[Help:Introduction to referencing/1|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the page will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt; [[User:Citrusbowler|Citrusbowler]] ([[User talk:Citrusbowler|talk]]) 00:53, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
