== &quot;Normal&quot; memory address range? ==

So, the Z8001 has 7-bit segment registers that extend RAM out to 8MB (64KB per segment x 128 segments...).

And Pole Position uses Z8002s with a &quot;smaller&quot; memory range (how small?).

But... what does the Z8000 itself manage? As it's 16 bit, did the original authour thus imply 64KB? (Not really very much for a 16-bit class CPU) ... Or does it inherently have SOME ability to use multiple segments... just not 128 of them?

How's this processor architecture? There's no info on register structure, instruction structure, anything...
