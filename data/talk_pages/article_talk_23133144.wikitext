Very nice job with the article DR! I only have one issue with it, the radar loop of the ET storm in 2008 is making the page very slow. Can you find a way to make it so that the image doesn't slow down the page? (this wont hold it back from passing GAN though). Since everything looks good, I'm passing the article.
