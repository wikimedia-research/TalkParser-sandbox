[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added {{#if:Atreyu (band)|to the page [[:Atreyu (band)]]}} do not comply with our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines for external links]] and have been removed. [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]]; nor should it be used for [[Wikipedia:Spam|advertising]] or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the {{#if:Atreyu (band)|[[talk:Atreyu (band)|article's talk page]]|article's talk page}} before reinserting it. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. {{#if:&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|Thank you.}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam1 --&gt;
:Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atreyu_%28band%29&amp;diff=197147805&amp;oldid=196681714 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove [[WP:NOT#REPOSITORY|unwanted links]] and [[WP:SPAM|spam]] from Wikipedia.  If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.
:The external links I reverted were matching the following [[regex|regex rule(s)]]: rule: '[A-Za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' (link(s): http://s125.photobucket.com/albums/p63/selenita_photos/?action=view&amp;current=atreyu.jpg&quot;   http://i125.photobucket.com/albums/p63/selenita_photos/atreyu.jpg&quot;) .  If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[Wikipedia:Media|media]] file (e.g. an [[Wikipedia:Images|image]] or a [[Wikipedia:Media help|sound or video]] file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's [[WP:COPYRIGHT|copyright policy]] and therefore probably should not be linked to.	Please consider using our [[Wikipedia:Upload|upload]] facility to upload a suitable media file.
:Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]].	 For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]].	 Thanks! [[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 02:51, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
