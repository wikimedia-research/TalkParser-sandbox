[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Widr|Widr]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/68.98.138.78|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Eden Riegel]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Widr|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Widr|Widr]] ([[User talk:Widr|talk]]) 22:26, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
