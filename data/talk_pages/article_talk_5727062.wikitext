I hope you like this place &amp;mdash; I sure do &amp;mdash; and want to [[Wikipedia:wikipedians|stay]]. Before getting too in-depth, you may want to read about the [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|Five pillars of Wikipedia]] and [[Wikipedia:Simplified Ruleset|simplified ruleset]]. If you need help on how to title new articles check out the [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions|naming conventions]], and for help on formatting the pages visit the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|manual of style]]. If you need help look at [[Wikipedia:Help]] and the [[Wikipedia:FAQ|FAQ]] , plus if you can't find your answer there, check the [[Wikipedia:Village Pump|Village Pump]] (for Wikipedia related questions) or the [[Wikipedia:Reference Desk|Reference Desk]] (for general questions)! There's still more help at the [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]] and [[Wikipedia:Policy Library|Policy Library]]. Plus, don't forget to visit the [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. And if you have any more questions after that, feel free to post them on [[User talk:Kf4bdy|my user talk page]] or place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on your talk page and someone will be by to help you shortly.

====Additional tips==== 
		 
Here's some extra tips to help you get around in the 'pedia! 
*If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]] is for you.	 
*You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too. Five will get you the datestamp only.
*You may want to add yourself to the [[Wikipedia:New user log|new user log]].	 
*If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the [[Wikipedia:votes for deletion|votes for deletion]] page. There is also a [[Wikipedia:votes for undeletion|votes for undeletion]] page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted.
*If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an [[IRC]] client (or don't mind getting one), check out the [[WP:BC|Bootcamp]]. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills.
*If you're bored and want to find something to do, try the ''Random page'' button in the sidebar, or check out the ''Open Task'' message in the [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

'''Happy Wiki-ing.''' &amp;mdash;[[User:Kf4bdy|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kf4bdy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kf4bdy|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Kf4bdy|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;
