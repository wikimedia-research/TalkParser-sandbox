[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Mattythewhite|Mattythewhite]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:James McClean]], but you didn't provide a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. It's been removed and archived in the page history for now, but if you'd like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the [[Help:Referencing for beginners|referencing for beginners]] tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Mattythewhite|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; [[User:Mattythewhite|Mattythewhite]] ([[User talk:Mattythewhite|talk]]) 21:57, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
