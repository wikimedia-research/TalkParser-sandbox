Wondering how to edit this U.S. City Entry?&lt;br&gt;
The [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities|WikiProject U.S. Cities]] standards might help.

==Status of Article==
This article is a very rough draft, and was not proof-read to a great degree.  I am currently working on getting the information from the [http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CF_CIS.htm State of Alaska's] community information database copied over for each community, at which point I will come back through and start editing.  If this message is still here, that means I have yet to come back.  Of course, please feel free to clean this up, hopefully to conform with the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities|WikiProject_Cities]] standards (or at least, as well as can be done for Alaska's unique villages and towns).  Thanks!!  &amp;mdash;'''[[{{ns:2}}:AKGhetto|akghetto]]'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:AKGhetto|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:39, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
