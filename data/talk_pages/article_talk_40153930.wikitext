==Speculation==
This article seems to contain a lot of things that appear to be speculation on the part of the author.  AFAICT this not what Wikipedia is:

*&quot; It is ''likely'' Virgin Media shops ''could'' be set up in major cities to promote its services, on a stand alone basis.&quot;
*&quot;The ultimate holding company of Virgin Media Plc is ''likely'' to be Virgin Media, Inc.&quot;
*&quot;However, if in the future it is felt that it would be inappropriate, the division ''could'' be re-branded something like Virgin Content, whilst a channel like Living TV ''could'' be re-branded as Virgin Living.&quot;

== Clean Up ==
This article is currently a bit of a mess and needs a cleanup.  Although I have tried to restructure it a bit, as I said above there is a lot of Crystal Ball gazing.  There are also acres of unsourced statements. IMHO this article, [[NTL]], and [[Telewest]] (possibly [[Virgin.net]] as well: AFAICT it is rebranding to Virgin Media) should all be merged, probably with NTL forming the back-bone of the new article amended for changes in the structure.

I definitely think this should happen once Virgin Media is officially launched (rumoured to be either 8th or 14th Feb).

:It appears someone has changed the dates of the merger on all articles with out providing any source.
:Just to add, it appears that Virgin.net IS changing its name to Virgin Media.  I dont know where this leaves the claim that Virgin.net is one of the 6 divisions of the new company.  As far as I can tell its products are being merged into the rest of the group.  Also what happens to NTL:Telewest business???? [[User:Pit-yacker|Pit-yacker]] 17:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

Posted by Alex on 4th of Febaury 2007

I think that the section Ntl:Telwest should be scrapped since virgin media is the new name of all the companies put together and more foucsing on this (Virgin Media)

----

Firstly Virgin Media Sections are to be created in a lot of Virgin Mobile stores, which cannot be rebranded at this time. 

Virgin.net will remain as an ADSL broadband service, as opposed to cable broadband.

Virign Media officialy launches on Feb 8th 2007 which has been labeled V Day.

As for a source - I am currently employed by ntl:telewest (Soon to be Virgin Media). The above information has been posted on the company intranet.

: Hi, Thanks for your reply. I have to admit I'm quite confused to what is happening, it appears NTL seem to be throwing in suprises for the media and public to keep us on our toes. As a customer of NTL, the details I have received suggest the Virgin.net will be re-branded &quot;Virgin Media&quot; at the same time.  Virgin's promotional website (know1st.co.uk) also appears to indicate Virgin.net will be integrated into the rest of the business.  If this is the case where do the 6 divisions come from? At the  same time I note there is no mention of &quot;NTL:Telewest Business&quot;, is this the 6th unit or is this also being integated into the rest of the business?
: I think we need to keep things from the NTL and Telewest articles such as the history, it sets a context about the company, and thats what Wikipedia is about more than being an advert for Virgin IMHO.  However, I guess a lot of the stuff regarding services will probably be irrelevant now.
:I have seen that [[Digital Spy]] is now reporting the new launch date which should do as a source for that.

===Merger of Virgin Mobile ===
Since Virgin Mobile has international operations, IMHO this should remain a separate article, unless they are also rebranding as Virgin Media [[User:Pit-yacker|Pit-yacker]] 02:53, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

B. The business divison is knows as ntl:Telewest Business

C. Telelvision content is Virgin Media Television

NASDAQ is American. Therefore there is no PLC. Virgin Media operates in the UK, so it is very likely that it is Virgin Media PLC. Look on the London Stock Exchange instead.

After searching, I found &quot;VMED - Virgin Media Inc&quot; So I guess you are right, but that does not mean there is no Virgin Media PLC.

Oh and in their terms (http://allyours.virginmedia.com/html/legal/oncable/terms.html) They reference &quot;Virgin Media Limited&quot;... which in the UK usually refers to a privately limited company (LTD)

[[User:Ongal|Ongal]] 18:32, 9 February 2007 (UTC)As much as I hate the proxy servers - I don't think that this problem is actually related:

''These transparent proxy servers also override the user's hosts file and prevent manual DNS updates.''

I could list many problems that are caused by proxies, but this isn't one of them to the best of my knowledge. Any objections if I remove this line?

== Redirects to this page ==
The following all now redirect here [[NTL]], [[Telewest]], [[Virgin.net]]. They are all historic names in British business history and deserve articles of their own.

:I agree. - [[User:X201|X201]] 12:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

::I agree. It's quite rediculous that people always jump on merging and redirecting articles just because companies have merged or rebranded. NTL and Telewest have been major brands in the UK for decades, and the wealth of information that is relevent to an encyclopedia like this but not specific to Virgin Media is huge.

:::Question is, where do you draw the line? How do you break the articles in two? (Given that IMHO duplication on Wikipeida is a '''very''' bad thing (it very quickly leads to inconsistencies - if it isnt already the first law of Wikipedia should be avoid duplication at all costs)).  Fact is Virgin Media *IS* NTL Inc - just with a different name. AFAICT, there hasnt even been a pretence on VM's part that it is a different company.

''(Moved by [[User:Pit-yacker|Pit-yacker]] as it is substantially the same topic of debate):'' Now that the Telewest article redirects here, where's amm the Telewest data gone; its history, trade and information specific to what Telewest was that no longer exists in the Vermin oriented article?

::For the main part see my reply above as to why I think one article is a better idea.  As for where the data is? Things such the history where copied and pasted to this article.  A few things that I felt werent really notable were deleted.  For example, are advertising campaigns really notable? Equally a lot of the services actually refer to the service that was provided just before the merger, and bare more similarities to the services provided by VM today rather than the Telewest of old.[[User:Pit-yacker|Pit-yacker]] 17:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Other than, I'm clearly against the mass redirecting to Vermin Media, there is a clear loss of information when redirects are implemented following company mergers. The information present on [[Telewest]] is a testimony of what the company was and is set in stone. The VM article will evolve as the branded services do, the Telewest will not. It is unencyclopedic to remove information on the grounds a company no longer exist when the company in quest is notable and possesses a substantial history. I agree with the changes you have implemented since the reopening of [[Telewest]] and it is important that such information hidden in history logs be present and not ommited in the VM article where they would be out of date and rather off topic, there place rightfully being in [[Telewest]]. I see that messages above tend to agree in a less aggressive manner to mine to the fact that articles are too easily merged and forgotten. Wikipedia would be very empty with no History related articles: ''sorry WWII was 50 years ago, it's been merged with Iraqi war II''.

::Correct. Sky Sports (and Sky Movies), though not currently, AIUI, the HD versions, are on what is called the ''Rate Card'', which is a list of channels maintained by OFCOM. If something is on the Rate Card, then any platform that is willing to pay the asking price, which is regulated, must be given the channels. Sky One was on the Rate Card for a time (which is how it turned up on ITV Digital), but was removed either last year or the year before (I don't know the details). Some have speculated that it might be put back on, especially if the rumoured move to put some Premier League football on it on Saturday afternoons turns out to be true.

:::AFAICT, in actual fact, Telewest took over NTL and re-named itself NTL (AFAICT NTL:Telewest was just a trading name).  If we want to be properly correct that means there should be at least 4 articles.  Telewest (pre 2006), NTL (pre 2006), NTL (2006-07) [aka the company previously known as Telewest] and Virgin Media.  Each of these has its own history.  Of course then we remember NTL (2006-07) does actually still exist, just its called Virgin Media now. This raises a few questions:
:::#Given the rebrand was very much a rolling programme.  Eg. product lines were harmonised and rebranded ahead of the re-name, where is the rebrand line drawn?

I removed the &quot;Internet Group Anonymous&quot; sentence. there is nothing noteworthy happening there yet. some youtube video with 267 views as of writing this is hardly worth mentioning in here. also: raidfags suck.

== BSkyB/virgin issue. ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Virgin Media replaced the Sky1, Sky2, Sky Travel, Sky Travel Extra, Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a standard message&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;umm not quite.
in a childish stunt, virgin renamed [[Sky News]] as 'Sky Snooze' and [[Sky Sports News]] as 'Old Sky Sports Snooze':&lt;br/&gt;- [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/01/sky_virgin_spat/ Sky takes ball and goes home]
&lt;/br&gt;- [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/virgin/Virgin-shrugs-off-the-loss.3351386.jp Virgin shrugs off the loss of Sky channels]&lt;br/&gt;
as it stands, the above quote is just wrong. i dont really know how to edit that section but it seems to have missed out a lot about virgin and their immature actions and comments. [[User:Perry mason|Perry mason]] ([[User talk:Perry mason|talk]]) 20:48, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

== Virgin rank as broadband provider in UK ==

The following statements cannot be correct:

&quot;Virgin Broadband {{as of|2009|1|alt=currently}} ranks as the UK's third-largest broadband supplier, behind [[TalkTalk]] and [[BT]]. Figures show Virgin to have just over 3.6 Million customers, which would translate as a 35% market share across the UK; its major competitor, [[BT Broadband]], had a 40% market share.&quot;

If BT has 40%, and Virgin has 35%, then the remaining competitors in total can have only 25%, thus Virgin must be the number 2 provider. What is the correct figure for TalkTalk? (above by 24.63.141.95) 

: The problem is that the figures are out of date, and have been doubled so as to represent the market share that Virgin Media would have in the fantasy world where their cable network reached the whole of the UK. VM's true market share is 22%, BT's about 27%. Have amended the paragraph with better figures and a citation.

== Cable London - article perfunctorily removed ==

It's rather disappointing that someone unknown, and without the courtesy of discussion, should remove the historical article I had researched and written about Cable London, one of the first and last of the small Cable operators in the 1980s and 1990s.  Foolish of me not to have kept a copy of my work - so many days' work and effort is just wasted owing to such action.  

As a local historian, I know that articles such as my mine have value to a wide range of people and it would have sat quite happily with, in the background and separate from, the article which has superseded it - Virgin Media (the successor company).  Indeed, given that nowhere else is such a company history available, it is plain daft and bad manners to throw it away (delete it) without reference to the originating author (me!).

If Wikipedia is not interested in encouraging, and safeguarding, such work as the article on Cable London, then the author should be told.  Actions such as this - and something similar, related to an entirely different article, happened before do nought to encourage research work and posting articles on Wikipedia.  

Whatever the outcome of this post, I would like my original article back, so that at Least I may have the work to hand.  I will donate a hard copy to the local borough archives who, I know, would appreciate it unlike, it seems, Wikipedia.

I have a life and do not spend my whole day online and Wiki-ing.  Thus, I cannot and do not monitor what happens to my work on Wikipedia.  It was only my responfing to a question about Cable London that alerted me to the article's total disappearance.  

Wikipedia, and those who monitor articles, would do well to embrace good manners and decent research effort.  I am quite happy not to contribute if my work is not wanted but I am certainly not prepared to have my work discarded willy nilly and my time and effort, all well intended, wasted.  So, please own up and let me have my article back!

:The [[Cable London]] article has been redirected to [[Virgin Media]] by [[User:Cloudbound|Cloudbound]], rather than deleted altogether. Although explanation is given in the edit summary, the actions appear to be in line with [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Redirection|Alternatives to deletion]] (a method of response is also outlined).
