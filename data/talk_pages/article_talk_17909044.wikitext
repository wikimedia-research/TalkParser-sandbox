I have added references and categories and given more info on the background of the song including recordings made. In light of this I have removed the notability and unreferenced tags. I hope all will find this reasonable. The article could still do with a lot of beefing up though particularly in relation to finding out who the characters in the song are and explaining so of the more obscure terms and references in the lyrics. --[[User:Seamasmac|Seamasmac]] ([[User talk:Seamasmac|talk]]) 16:24, 12 June 2008 (UTC)
:It still needs some secondary sources and some information as to why this song is significant. Perhaps there's something [http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22The%20Charladies%27%20Ball%22%20-Wikipedia here] that can be used.
