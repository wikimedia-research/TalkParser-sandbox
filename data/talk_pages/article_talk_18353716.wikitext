== Poll to move to face-transitive ==

Face-transitive is a standard term for polytopes. ''Face-uniform'' was an incorrect term derived from ''uniform polytopes'' which are are vertex-transitive, and their duals which are face-transitive.

* Yes - [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] 22:27, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

* Yes and no. I would prefer to move it to ''Isohedral'' because it's shorter and has been around longer, and redirect from ''Face-transitive''. [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] 13:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
*: It can be both with redirects, although I agree best to encourage one set of terms or other. How about starting by adding links/referenecs to all these stubs? [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] 19:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

::I wasn't sure whether it was best to move the pages first, before doing all that. Yes I know it can be both with redirects, but we still need to decide the titles of the pages to which we redirect the others. [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] 20:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

==Move to Isohedral?==
Looking behind the recent to-and-fro moves, it seems to me that [[Isohedral]] should be more than a redirect. It could be made a [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambuguation]] page, or it could be basically this one, with links to [[isohedral number]]s and the like. My vote is to move this page across. -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 19:35, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

: Hi Guy. I don't have a strong preference what to do on the ''isohedral'' page. I'm not against moving this page there, or making it a disambuguation page. I do like using ''face-transitive'' better for being more descriptive to me, but that can as well exist as a redirect to isohedral. 
:: Hmmmm.... a separate item, I added the ''isotopic'' term here, but unsure if it well belongs here, a bit different, meaning facet-transitive, so isotopic=isohedral for polyhedra only. Maybe it should be on its own page? I suppose it is too underused. The duals of uniform polytopes (isogonal/vertex-transitive) are isotopic, but they are pretty rarely given. Like the [[Disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb]] is isotopic (cell-transitive), but might as well say that! [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 20:24, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

=== Don't use an adjective ===

If this is to be moved, move it to [[face-transitive polytope]] or [[face-transitive polyhedron]] or [[isohedral polytope]] or [[isohedral polyhedron]] or some other appropriate noun phrase, not to an adjective. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] ([[User talk:Michael Hardy|talk]]) 20:48, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

: Or to '''[[face-transitivity]]'''.  That is a noun phrase. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] ([[User talk:Michael Hardy|talk]]) 20:49, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

::In that case, I suggest '''[[Isohedrality]]'''. We should only use &quot;polytope&quot; in the title if we create a separate disambiguation page, which would be trivially small and nobody has voted for it. And hey, can you guys stop this ping-pong renaming until we reach consensus? It's making me dizzy ;-( -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 09:49, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

: I'm mostly content with either. I see that [[edge-transitivity]] (isotoxality!?) and [[cell-transitivity]] (isochoricity?!) have already been moved now. And maybe [[facet-transitivity]] (isotopicity?!) Oh, I'm far over my head beyond ''-transitivity''! [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 15:34, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

::&quot;Isotoxality&quot; only seems to appear in a single paper, unsurprisingly by Grunbaum and Shepherd (I don't know about &quot;isotopic&quot; vs. &quot;facet-transitive&quot;, especially as &quot;facet&quot; means different things to different polyhedronists). In truth, only the adjectives are commonly used - in all cases the nouns are much rarer. I have asked the maths wikiproject about [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics#Adjectives_as_article_titles|adjectives as article titles]] in this unusual circumstance. -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 19:46, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:::From the wikiproject discussion, the best idea is to redirect &quot;isohedral&quot; etc. to the associated polyhedron article, e.g. &quot;Isohedron&quot;, and at the top of the article to put disambiguation links to the other articles (tilings, etc) - which for the most part are there already. So if nobody objects, I shall move the &quot;xxx-transitive/ity&quot; pages over to &quot;Iso-xxx polyhedron&quot; when I get a moment. -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 21:34, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:: Ummmm... what about the issue that these terms apply to polytopes in general, AND include infinite forms as the honeycomb/tilings? I'd prefer [[Isohedrality (geometry)]] if needed for clarity, or something like that, just like [[Truncation (geometry)]], etc. See [[:Category:Polytopes]] for other example. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 21:57, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:::&quot;Isohedrality (geometry) would be little more than a very short disambig page: policy guidelines do not approve of spawning mini-pages unnecessarily, and I do not think that it is necessary here. Also, &quot;Isotoxality (geometry)&quot; has only one documented usage - that's hardly encyclopedic. Isohedral polychora are of comparably minor interest to isotoxal polyhedra - the interesting ones being the isochora. So unless and until &quot;Isohedral polychoron&quot; spawns its own article, it should at best be no more than a redirect to [[Isohedron]] which would have the disambig bit at the top, or maybe to [[polychoron]]. It's all about reconciling common sense with Wikipedia policy. I actually believe that the insistence on nouns is in this instance misplaced, but I'm not about to start a policy war with the self-appointed Wikipedia thought police. -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 08:57, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

:: I can't really say I follow much of this logic, BUT I'd be okay with something like this: (And adding a (geometry) qualifier anywhere it is needed.)
::# [[Isogonality]], redirected there by [[Vertex-transitivity]]/[[Vertex-transitive]] (0 faces)
::# [[Isotoxality]], redirect there by [[Edge-transitivity]]/[[Edge-transitive]] (1 faces)
::# [[Isohedrality]], redirect there by [[Face-transitivity]]/[[Face-transitive]] (2 faces)
::# [[isochoricity]](?), redirected there by [[Cell-transitivity]]/[[Cell-transitive]] (3 faces)
::# [[isotopical]](?), redirected there by [[Facet-transitivity]]/[[Facet-transitive]] (n-1 faces)
Anyway I DEFINITE dislike adding the word &quot;polyhedron&quot; to terms that apply to all polytopes/tilings/honeycombs. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:12, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

:Every scheme so far seems to have its problems:
:* &quot;Xxxxxality&quot; fails because &quot;Isotoxality&quot; is not used enough to warrant inclusion.
:* &quot;Xxxxx-transitive&quot; fails because &quot;Cell-transitive&quot; suffers the same problem (Google returns just 1 significant hit).
:* &quot;Xxxxxal polytope&quot; fails because tilings, numbers and other things can have these properties.
:* &quot;Xxxxxal&quot; is what everybody uses but fails politically because it is an adjective.
:* &quot;Xxxxxal figure&quot; is perhaps a workable alternative? It includes the commonly used form and manages to be a noun.
Would that last one be OK by you? -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 19:23, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

: Good suggestion. Gosset used the term ''figure'' for both polytopes and tilings. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 21:18, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
::# [[Isogonal figure]] (0-face transitive).
::# [[Isotoxal figure]] (1-face transitive)
::# [[Isohedral figure]] (2-face transitive)
::# [[Isochoric figure]] (3-face transitive)
::# [[Isotopic figure]] ((n-1)-face transitive)

:::OK I have moved the first three, and started a poll '''[[Talk:Cell-transitivity|here]]''' to delete the fourth, as it is so little-used. I know nothing about &quot;isotopic&quot;, so have done nothing about it. If it is as unused as cell transitivity, i suggest that it should go too. -- Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 19:08, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== k-isohedral ==

I am confused by the section {{pslink|k-isohedral}}. The definitions for polytopes and tilings appear to be very different: The former makes no mention of symmetry orbits and explicitly forbids different shapes. Strangely, it does not refer to any ''k''. The latter defines ''k'' as the number of symmetry orbits and explicitly allows different shapes. But why ''m''&lt;''k''? Apparently confirming my suspicion that the definition for polytopes is simply wrong, the example is a polytope that has 2 or 3 symmetry orbits. (An ambiguity, that, btw, doesn't make it a good choice for an example.) But if the definition for tilings is the correct one for any figures, we run into another problem: The example says it is &quot;''k''-isohedral but not isohedral&quot;, which seems to contradict my understanding that isohedral is the same as 1-isohedral. Is my understanding wrong or is there a special condition that ''k'' &gt; 1? Why would that be? &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 16:24, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

: Yes, wording could use improvement. They should be the same. Isohedral means 1-isohedral. While k-isohedral doesn't require all k types of faces to be identical, hence the ''m'', which is called monohedral if m=1. For instance the [[k-uniform tiling]]s have k-types of vertices, and are also t-isohedral (with ''t'' types of regular polygon faces). So examples here really should show different types of faces to not give the wrong impression. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 17:26, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

:It does seem fundamentally correct, although the wording is awful and Tom has already changed what you were asking about so I cannot be sure. Tiles or faces of a given shape may lie in more than one symmetry orbit, i.e. in distinct groups which permute with their own members but not with each other's despite being congruent. Thus, the number of distinct shapes ''m'' may be less than the number of orbits ''k''. This applies both to polyhedra and to tilings. Also, the section title should not be an adjective, it is an embarrassment to whoever put it there. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 17:48, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

:: Thanks a lot for your clarification and edits to the article; that's a huge improvement! Now my only question remaining is why there is the condition ''m''&lt;''k''. I wouldn't be surprised if this strict inequality could be proven to hold in reality, but I don't see why it is part of the definition. &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 17:57, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
::: Your intuition is correct, it is not part of the definition - for polyhedra or for tilings. It needs to be explained separately, in a paragraph relevant to both polyhedra and tilings. &amp;mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 18:02, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

::: I added some varied examples. The text still could use improvement and unification between polyhedra and tilings. The ''m'' is the number of unique shaped-faces, and the ''k'' is the number of symmetry positions, with different colors used to distingish geometrically identical faces. I don't care of the ''m'' commentary is removed. I agree it is confusing. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:06, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

:::: {{EC}} Thank you! And, yes, I meant to thank you for the edits! &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 18:19, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

::: p.s. The [[pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron]] article says it is 2-isogonal, but 3-isogonal if only rotational symmetry is considered. I've not seen any definitions that say &quot;k-isohedral in rotational symmetry&quot;. I actually uploaded a new image with 2 colors, but the original had 3. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:15, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

:::: Yes, that's what I referred to. I realize the word &quot;ambiguous&quot; isn't exactly correct, since for each definition it is unambiguous. I just meant that it adds another aspect to consider, which doesn't help when explaining a simple concept. Your other examples already do that well, so we could just leave out the pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron. On the other hand, the confusion also gets diluted thanks to the other examples, so it might as well stay. &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 18:23, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

::::: p.s. All the examples are edge-to-edge, but we could add a non-edge-to-edge example tiling like the [[Herringbone pattern]] that has 2 or more short edges along a longer one. I guess polyhedra also don't have to be edge-to-edge, but not very common. ... I replaced the isohedral tiling example with herringbone. k-isohedral tilings could also have curved edges, like this [[:File:Wallpaper_group-p6m-1.jpg]] could be 3-isohedral by the black boundaries.[[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:27, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: Good choice, the herringbone is a great example because it's well known. It's also a good idea to just replace it, since I like the nice symmetry between your two tables. Question, though: Are regular-faced and monohedral mutually exclusive? &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 18:38, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::: Not mutually exclusive. There are 3 [[regular tiling]]s (and 5 [[platonic solid]]s that are 1-isohedral and monohedral. 
::::: The [[Voderberg tiling]] is monohedral, but perhaps &amp;infin;-isohedral since it doesn't have translational symmetry! [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:33, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::: Wow, that's an amazing pattern! If I'm not mistaken, it doesn't even have rotational symmetry except the obvious C2 in the center and then perhaps locally for some tiles. &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 18:41, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
::::::: Yes, just C2 [[inversion symmetry]]. I actually don't know what the coloring implies. There are [[frieze group]]s also with infinite tiles, like the isohedral [[:File:E2_tiling_22i-8_dual.png]], but fortunately not many examples there. And we could also show hyperbolic k-symmetry, also not many examples. No, I'm not really suggesting more examples, unless there's a source that says Voderberg is &amp;infin;-isohedral. AND [[penrose tiling]]s would also be like this has 4 tile shapes[[:File:Penrose Tiling (P1).svg]], but &amp;infin;-isohedral based on radial symmetry. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 18:56, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:::::::: I think it's good enough as it is; it explains the concept as far as it's useful. That's all I feel needs to be done here for now. Now you got me hooked with the Voderberg tiling. I'll continue the conversation on that [[talk:Voderberg tiling|there]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 19:18, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

== Monohedral figures==
I see '''''r''-hedral''' apparently means ''r'' shapes of tiles, monohedral (r=1), dihedral (r=2), trihedral (r=3)... [https://books.google.com/books?id=KW4EwONsQJgC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;ots=2X-KKkUa9t&amp;dq=monohedral%20dihedral%20trihedral&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=monohedral%20dihedral%20trihedral&amp;f=false] So maybe this could be defined somewhere else, and then monohedral could be moved there. [[Monohedral tiling]] directs to [[Tessellation#Introduction_to_tessellations]]. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 19:09, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
:: We don't usually use redirect pages for discussions, but how about moving this to [[talk:Monohedral tiling]]? I could undelete that page, which contained just the maths rating template. &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 19:18, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
::: It wouldn't be good to have talk page on a redirect. [[Monohedral figure]] directs here at the moment, so I'll just add a new section for now. [[User:Tomruen|Tom Ruen]] ([[User talk:Tomruen|talk]]) 19:24, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
