I'm fairly well satisfied that 
# 1889-1962 are his correct dates
# our confusion about it is not from our clerical error.
Most of my basis for that is two Google searches, with about equal numbers of hits, but from my incomplete inspection, i think that the '72 YoDs are disproportionately attributable to WP compared to the '62 YoDs. (I need to think about the 1963 YoD, but i take comfort that it is contradicted elsewhere on the only site i found it on.)  Here are the Google URLs:

Perhaps i'll inspect further, say more, and go around hunting down the bad dates in our articles that refer to him. &lt;br&gt;--[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]]â€¢[[User talk:Jerzy|t]] 06:47, 6 December 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
