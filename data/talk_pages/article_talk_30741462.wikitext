The article [[Jay Weigel]] has been [[WP:BLPPROD|proposed for deletion]] because under Wikipedia policy, all '''[[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]]''' created after March 18, 2010, must have at least one [[WP:V#Sources|source]] that directly supports material in the article. 

If you created the article, please don't take offense. Instead, consider improving the article. For help on inserting references, see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]] or ask at [[Wikipedia:Help desk]]. Once you have provided at least one [[WP:V#Sources|reliable source]], you may remove the {{tl|prod blp}} tag. '''Please do not remove the tag unless the article is sourced.''' If you cannot provide such a source within ten days, the article may be deleted, but you can {{#ifexist:Jay Weigel|request that it be undeleted|[[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request that it be undeleted]]}} when you are ready to add one.&lt;!-- Template:ProdwarningBLP --&gt; [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 21:40, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
