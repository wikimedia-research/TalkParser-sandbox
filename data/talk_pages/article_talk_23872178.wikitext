== Orphaned non-free media (File:Gold_idol-screenshot.jpg) ==
[[File:Ambox warning blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Gold_idol-screenshot.jpg]]'''. The media description page currently specifies that it is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, it is currently [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Orphanage|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the media was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that media for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'file' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;File&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that all non-free media not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Files|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Orphaned --&gt; [[User:Melesse|Melesse]] ([[User talk:Melesse|talk]]) 05:02, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for November 17==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[The Slickers]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[CBS Records]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/The_Slickers|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/The_Slickers|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 12:22, 17 November 2012 (UTC)
