Hi Andy king50, I have moved [[Rishiri]] to [[Rishiri Island]], per [[WP:RM]]. Please remember to create the disambiguation page, otherwise there would have been no need to move it!

== NZ Maps ==

Hi Andy - 

not sure how much help I can be - I rarely use online map resources (and usually then for overseas countries). Wises has a good reputation - they used to put out the country's top Gazeteer (although dated, a copy of &quot;Wises New Zealand Guide&quot; is very useful).They might only specialise in street maps now though. I've heard good things about a CD-ROM made by [http://www.tumonz.co.nz/ TUMONZ] - if you're looking to buy a NZ map, that might be your best bet.

: the TUMONZ DVD looks quite good, ... maybee I'll skip my annual donation to wikipedia this Year an by this instead.... Thanks [[User:Andy king50|Andy king50]] ([[User talk:Andy king50#top|talk]]) 17:53, 18 February 2008 (UTC)
