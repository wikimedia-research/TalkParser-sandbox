== Not the First Gay Marriage on TV ==

This article currently says this was the first gay marriage &quot;within American culture&quot;â€” whatever the heck that is supposed to mean.  If the writer meant this was the first gay marriage on a popular TV series, he or she is wrong: it is far from the first.  There was a gay marriage as far back as the early 1990s on the weekly [[dramedy]] [[Northern Exposure]], and there have been others since then.

:Reese and Bianca's wedding/marriage was the first gay/lesbian marriage on an American soap opera/daytime drama, which the lead (intro) very clearly states. This is backed up by various reliable sources. It did/does not say &quot;the first gay marriage on television ever.&quot; It is distinguished by the words &quot;American,&quot; &quot;soap opera&quot; and &quot;daytime drama.&quot; Yes, part of the lead says &quot;Though the wedding received praise for being the first within American culture,&quot; but most people should realize that we are speaking of the first within American soap opera...since that is specified earlier. If you feel that we need to put &quot;soap opera&quot; or &quot;daytime drama&quot; yet again, then that can be done. And judging by your misunderstanding, we might need to.
