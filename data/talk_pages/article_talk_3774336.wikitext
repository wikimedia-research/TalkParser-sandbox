Seriously, though, we are trying to write an encyclopedia here, so don't make joke edits. Some readers looking for a serious article mightn't find them amusing. Remember, millions of people read Wikipedia, so we have to take what we do a bit seriously here.

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikipedia]]. Thank you for your contributions.

Currently, you are [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|editing]] without a username. You can continue to do so as you are not required to log in to Wikipedia to read and write articles, however, logging in will result in a username being shown instead of your [[IP address]] (yours is {{PAGENAME}}). Logging in does not require any personal details. There are many other [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits for logging in to Wikipedia]].

Please note these points:

* Please [[Wikipedia:Copyrights |respect others' copyrights]]; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly.
* Please use a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view |neutral point of view]] to edit the article; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
* If you are testing, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox&amp;action=edit do that]. 
* Do not add unreasonable contents into any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|articles]], such as: '''[[copyright]]ed''' texts, '''advertisement''' messages, and texts that are '''not related to that article'''. Both adding such unreasonable information and editing articles maliciously are considered vandalism. A user who repeatedly vandalises articles will be blocked from editing.

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia Tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia.  If you have any questions, ask me on [[{{ns:3}}:kukini|my Talk page]] &amp;ndash; I will answer your questions as far as I can! Thank you again for contributing to Wikipedia.
