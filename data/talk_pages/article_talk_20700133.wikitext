==Speedy deletion of &quot;Lee Legal&quot;==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A page you created, [[:Lee Legal]], has been tagged for [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion]], as it meets one or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]]; specifically, it is about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how it is important or significant, and thus why it should be included in an encyclopedia. Please see the guidelines for what is [[Wikipedia:Notability|generally accepted as notable]], and the [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|guidelines for companies]] in particular.

You are welcome to contribute content which complies with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies#Content and Style|content policies]] and any applicable [[Wikipedia:Notability|inclusion guidelines]]. However, please do not simply re-create the page with the same content. You may also wish to read our [[Wikipedia:Introduction|introduction to editing]] and [[Wikipedia:Your first article|guide to writing your first article]].

Thank you. [[User:BarretBonden|BarretBonden]] ([[User talk:BarretBonden|talk]]) 00:05, 15 December 2008 (UTC)
