{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. This is a notice to inform you that a tag has been placed on [[:The Office Group]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A3|section A3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an article with no content whatsoever, or whose contents consist only of external links, a &quot;See also&quot; section, book references, category tags, template tags, interwiki links, images, a rephrasing of the title, a question that should have been asked at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help]] or [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|reference]] desks, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:The Office Group|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontent-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; —[[User:Biblioworm|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6F4E37;&quot;&gt;'''''Biblio'''''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6F4E37;&quot;&gt;'''''worm'''''&lt;/span&gt;]] 17:36, 28 November 2014 (UTC)
