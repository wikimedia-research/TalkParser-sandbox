[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:DoorsAjar|DoorsAjar]]. I noticed that you recently removed some content from [[:Hello, Dolly! (film)]],&amp;nbsp;with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello%2c_Dolly!_(film)?diff=573205166 this edit]&lt;span&gt;, without explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]]. If this was a mistake, don't worry, the removed content has been restored. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:DoorsAjar|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-delete-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-delete1 --&gt;[[User:DoorsAjar|DoorsAjar]] ([[User talk:DoorsAjar|talk]]) 20:16, 16 September 2013 (UTC)
The information is nto correct, and until the correct information can be added to the page and not changed by someone who is not sure of their facts, it should not be allowed to remain on the page.
