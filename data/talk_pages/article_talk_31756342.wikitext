*'''You don't need to read anything''' - anybody can edit; just go to an article and edit it. [[WP:BOLD|Be Bold]], but please don't put silly stuff in - it will be removed very quickly, and will annoy people.

*'''Ask for help'''. [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikipedia-en-help Talk to us live], or edit this page, put '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and describe what help you need. Someone will reply very quickly - usually within a few minutes.

*'''Play''' in your user area. For example, create [[User:Tsmoreta/test]].

*'''Edit existing articles''', before you make your own. Look at some subjects that you know about, and see if you can make them a bit better. For example, [[Wikipedia:Cleanup]].

*'''When you're ready''', read about [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]. It should be about something well-known, and it will need references.

Good luck with editing; please drop me a line some time on [[User talk:Chzz|my own talk page]].

There's lots of information below. Once again, welcome to the fantastic world of Wikipedia!

== Your submission at [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]] ==

&lt;div style=&quot;border:solid 1px #9accf6;background:#f1f9ff;padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em;width:20em;color:black;margin-bottom: 1.5em;margin-left: 1.5em;width: 90%;&quot;&gt;[[File:Citaton-needed-vertical.svg|150px|left|link=Wikipedia:Citing sources]]
Hi Tsmoreta,

You recently made a submission to [[WP:AFC|Articles for Creation]] &amp;mdash; {{#if: Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tania Sang | the page is '''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tania Sang]]''' &amp;mdash; }} and it will be reviewed by a volunteer soon.

However... it doesn't seem to have correctly formatted references.

All articles on Wikipedia should have inline, numbered references after facts, showing the 'reliable source' (newspaper, book, etc.) where the information can be checked.

If you put a reference like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Chzz is 98 years old.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;The book of Chzz&quot;, Aardvark Books, 2009. &lt;/ref&gt;

He likes tea.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
[[File:Citing_sources_tutorial,_part_1.ogv|right|thumb|Video tutorial - hit play, then right-click for &quot;full screen&quot;]]
...then the reference will automatically be displayed as a small number&lt;sup&gt;[{{colour|blue|1}}]&lt;/sup&gt;, and the number will link to the details, wherever there is a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;mdash; there should be one of those in a section titled == References ==.

You can see that example in action on this page: [[user:chzz/demo/simpleref]].

For more help, see [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]].

It is a very important policy of Wikipedia that all information is [[WP:V|verifiable]] &amp;mdash; i.e., that all material added to articles must be attributable to a source with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.

Your submission '''will''' be reviewed as soon as possible, and we'll try to help with it, but it would help us a lot if you could add inline references.

If you need any other kind of help, just put {{tn|helpme}} at the end of ''this'' page, followed by a question. Best, &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid;background:#00008B&quot;&gt;[[User:Chzz|'''&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00008B;color:white&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chzz&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']][[User talk:Chzz|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00008B;background-color:yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;►&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:50, 12 May 2011 (UTC)

The page will shortly be deleted.
