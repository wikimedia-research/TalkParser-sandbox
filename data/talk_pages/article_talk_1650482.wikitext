Thank you for uploading '''[[:File:Stubbspamphlet.jpg]]'''. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, please add a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a brief restatement of that website's terms of use of its content. However, if the copyright holder is a party unaffiliated from the website's publisher, that copyright should also be acknowledged.

If you have uploaded other files, consider verifying that you have specified sources for those files as well. You can find a list of files you have created [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Supernanny}} in your upload log]. '''Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''' per Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F4|F4]]. If the image is [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyrighted]] and [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free]], '''the image will be deleted 48 hours after 11:36, 1 May 2010 (UTC)''' per [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] criterion [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F7|F7]].
