[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Forgot to put name|Forgot to put name]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/76.64.125.130|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Spider monkey]] because it didn't appear constructive. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Forgot to put name|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;  [[User talk:Forgot to put name|Forgot to put name]] 06:34, 15 January 2013 (UTC)
