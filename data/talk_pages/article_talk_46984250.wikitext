==Recent edit to [[Preston High School (Ontario)]]==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[Preston High School (Ontario)]], but you didn't provide a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. It's been removed for now, but if you'd like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] and re-add it, please do so! If you need guidance on referencing, please see the [[Help:Referencing for beginners|referencing for beginners]] tutorial, or if you think I made a mistake, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you! &lt;b style=&quot;font-family:tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:TeaLover1996|&lt;b style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Tea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Lover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:TeaLover1996|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Talk to me &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;‚òè&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/b&gt; 08:42, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
