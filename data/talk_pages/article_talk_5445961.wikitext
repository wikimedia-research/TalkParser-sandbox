==Charlie's Angel's==
I never heard they were modeled after Charlie's Angels characters: reference for it?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.12.101.30|78.12.101.30]] ([[User talk:78.12.101.30|talk]]) 23:21, 30 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== I don't think her memory returns in the manga. ==

The article currently says &quot;Toshio spends time with her and her memories come back&quot;, but the last thing I see in the book on the topic is Toshio shows Hitomi one of the Cat's Eye calling cards and asks &quot;これを覚えてるかい？&quot;  She replies &quot;思いだせない&quot;, and he says &quot;それでいい・・・思いだせないほうがいい・・・&quot;  (&quot;Do you remember this?&quot; &quot;I don't remember&quot;  &quot;It's better this way...It's better that you don't remember...&quot;)  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.181.39.169|71.181.39.169]] ([[User talk:71.181.39.169|talk]]) 18:56, 11 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== City Hunter ==

Isn't this the preceding work to City Hunter (then succeeded by Angel Heart)? Shouldn't there be mention of that, and the links to it? [[Special:Contributions/70.55.86.157|70.55.86.157]] ([[User talk:70.55.86.157|talk]]) 04:41, 28 June 2008 (UTC)


You're correct that Cat's Eye was Tsukasa Hojo's first real successful series. There was also a crossover episode with City Hunter as Saeba Ryo made his debut...although Ryo was smaller in height there.  In City Hunter, Umibozu bought the Cat's Eye cafe and has been a fixture thought the series as well as in Angel Heart (I think that this series IS the true sequel to City Hunter no matter what other fans think!)  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.207.95.248|98.207.95.248]] ([[User talk:98.207.95.248|talk]]) 19:25, 28 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
