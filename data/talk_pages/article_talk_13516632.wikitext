==Speedy deletion of [[:Eric roxas]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|32px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Eric roxas]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia per [[WP:CSD#a7|CSD a7]]. 

Under the [[WP:CSD#General_criteria|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not meet basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Your first article|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article]], and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the article and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag) and leave a note on the page's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

[[Image:Circle-style-warning.svg|left|48px|]]
A {{[[Template:prod|prod]]}} template has been added to the article [[Whoosh]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice explains why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dated prod}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:Whoosh|its talk page]]. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached. If you endorse deletion of the article, and you are the only person who has made substantial edits to the page, please tag it with {{tl|db-author}}.
