I'm not sure, but I took those images. Are they okay now? Is there a way to still have them copywritten in Wiki if I took them?
::Yes your images have been properly tag but please do not delete content on your talk page which may be needed for future reference.

==Image Tagging [[:Image:PBRLOGOCOLOR.jpg]]==

&lt;/center&gt;

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:PBRLOGOCOLOR.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{tl|GFDL-self}} tag can be used to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], and then use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use]].  See [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you. --[[User:Nivus|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Nivus&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Nivus|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:21, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with Image:Pbrbullridingequipment.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Pbrbullridingequipment.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikipedia]] because of [[Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikipedia are [[open content]], [[public domain]], and [[fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;. If you have not already done so, please also include the source of the image. In many cases this will be the website where you found it.

Please specify the copyright information and source on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.

==File permission problem with File:Soapontherangecharacters2.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Soapontherangecharacters2.jpg]]'''. I noticed that while you provided a valid copyright licensing tag, there is no proof that the creator of the file agreed to license it under the given license. 

If you created this media entirely yourself but have previously published it elsewhere (especially online), please either 
* make a note permitting reuse under the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] or another acceptable free license (see [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags/Free licenses|this list]]) '''at the site of the original publication'''; or
* Send an email from an address associated with the original publication to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}''', stating your ownership of the material and your intention to publish it under a free license. You can find a sample permission letter [[WP:CONSENT|here]]. If you take this step, add {{tl|OTRS pending}} to the file description page to prevent premature deletion.

If you did not create it entirely yourself, please ask the person who created the file to take one of the two steps listed above, or if the owner of the file has already given their permission to you via email, please forward that email to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}'''. 

If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], use a tag such as {{tlp|non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags#Fair use]], and add a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|rationale]] justifying the file's use on the article or articles where it is included. See [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied, too. You can find a list of files you have created in [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Billymay}} your upload log]. '''Files lacking evidence of permission may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Files|criteria for speedy deletion]].
