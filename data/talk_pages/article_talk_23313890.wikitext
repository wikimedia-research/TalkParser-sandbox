== Move page to [[Shangganling]] ==
[[:Triangle Hill]] → [[Shangganling]] &amp;mdash; Content does not match article title, Triangle Hill is a hill, Shangganling is a hamlet behind the hill. Since the content of the article describes the hamlet, it should be moved to the hamlet's name Shangganling. [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 06:01, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

:The original article name is [[上甘岭]], which means &quot;Shangganling&quot; the hamlet, not &quot;Triangle Hill&quot; the hill.

:Source [http://www.superarmy.com/zmzl/koreawar/2001_0207_1.htm: here], rough English translation is: ''In the valley behind Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge, there is a hamlet with 10 families that is called Shangganling.'' [[User:Jim101|Jim101]] ([[User talk:Jim101|talk]]) 17:50, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
