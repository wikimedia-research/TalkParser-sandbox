This is an automated message from [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]].  I have perfomed a web search with the contents of [[:Fernhill School and Language College]], and it appears to be a substantial copy of {{{2|http://fernhill-comp.hants.sch.uk/}}}.  For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material; such additions will be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences.

This message was placed automatically, and it is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists.  If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article and it would be appreciated if you could drop a note on [[User talk:Coren|the maintainer's talk page]].

==Image copyright problem with Image:N3009520359 9574.jpg==

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|32px|left|Image Copyright problem]]
Thank you for uploading [[:Image:N3009520359 9574.jpg]]. However, it currently is missing information on its copyright status. Wikipedia takes [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] very seriously. It may be deleted soon, unless we can determine the '''license''' and the '''source''' of the image. If you know this information, then you can add a '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|copyright tag]]''' to the [[Help:Image page|image description page]].

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|media copyright questions page]]. Thanks again for your cooperation. NOTE: once you correct this, please remove the tag from the image's page. [[User:STBotI|STBotI]] ([[User talk:STBotI|talk]]) 09:27, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
==File permission problem with File:Court Moor School Logo.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Court Moor School Logo.jpg]]'''. I noticed that while you provided a valid copyright licensing tag, there is no proof that the creator of the file agreed to license it under the given license. 

If you created this media entirely yourself but have previously published it elsewhere (especially online), please either 
* make a note permitting reuse under the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] or another acceptable free license (see [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags/Free licenses|this list]]) '''at the site of the original publication'''; or
* Send an email from an address associated with the original publication to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}''', stating your ownership of the material and your intention to publish it under a free license. You can find a sample permission letter [[WP:CONSENT|here]]. If you take this step, add {{tl|OTRS pending}} to the file description page to prevent premature deletion.

If you did not create it entirely yourself, please ask the person who created the file to take one of the two steps listed above, or if the owner of the file has already given their permission to you via email, please forward that email to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}'''. 

If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], use a tag such as {{tlp|non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags#Fair use]], and add a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|rationale]] justifying the file's use on the article or articles where it is included. See [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied, too. You can find a list of files you have created in [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Colonial77}} your upload log]. '''Files lacking evidence of permission may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Files|criteria for speedy deletion]]. You may wish to read the Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:image use policy|image use policy]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-no permission-notice --&gt; [[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 22:27, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for August 9==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[ICE - International Currency Exchange]], you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages [[Foreign Exchange]] and [[Currency exchange]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/ICE_-_International_Currency_Exchange|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/ICE_-_International_Currency_Exchange|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Asset Control]]==
[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Asset Control]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Asset Control|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;ยง[[User:FreeRangeFrog|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00CA00&quot;&gt;FreeRangeFrog&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:52, 21 April 2015 (UTC)

== April 2015 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from [[:Asset Control]], a page you have created yourself. If you believe the page should not be deleted, you may contest the deletion by clicking on the button that says: '''Contest this speedy deletion''' which appears inside the speedy deletion notice. This will allow you to make your case '''''on the article's [[Talk:Asset Control|talk page]]'''''. Administrators will consider your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy1 --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;ยง[[User:FreeRangeFrog|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00CA00&quot;&gt;FreeRangeFrog&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:05, 22 April 2015 (UTC)
