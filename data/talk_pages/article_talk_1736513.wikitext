==Untitled==
I live in India. Am an avid Cricket Follower. Can some one tell me the Name of the Cricketer who has represented NZ in Test Matches and is a Qualified Medical Doctor?  - Shankar. C.N.

Not sure, I'm fairly certain it wasn't a recent player. Martin Sneddon (1980s player and current head of NZ cricket) is a lawyer and Adam Parore has a law degree too. [[User:Lisiate|Lisiate]] 03:01, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It's [[Justin Vaughan]] - now NZC CEO

==Underarm delivery==
The umpires ruled it legal because it was legal. I think that needs to be re-worded slightly. The way it reads it sounds like the umpires had a choice in the matter. The sportsmanship can be debated but it was allowable under the rules of the competition at the time.

==NPOV??==
&quot;To this day, Australia treats New Zealand as inferior, agreeing only to three-Test series while playing Test series comprising five or even six tests against other nations, such as India, England or the West Indies.&quot;
Come on, grow up! The truth is NZ gets 3 test series because 1) they don't attract big enough crowds and 2) there isn't enough time to have 5 test series against everyone. Same as Pakistan, South Africa, and the same as the West Indies (see http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/406181.html). So your example is not only out-of-date but reflects what I'm saying - when the West Indies attracted big crowds they got 5 tests. Also given the amount of tests there are hardly any 5 test series. Australia only played 2 in India this year. Last time India toured there were 4 tests.
I really suggest this is removed or reworded. It reflects badly on the quality of the article. [[User:Tigerman2005|Tigerman2005]] ([[User talk:Tigerman2005|talk]]) 10:58, 13 November 2010 (UTC)

==Copyvio pic?==
That's a nice pic of the Black Caps in the article. Unfortunately, it has ''www.photosport.co.nz'' on it,  top left hand corner. Is it in fact copyvio? [[User:Moriori|Moriori]] 23:22, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

::* I'm not sure that that means fair-use at all. Isn't publishing an image in the internet redistribution as per the second sentence above?

== Matches this year ==

The article says NZ has played 3 tests this year. Haven't they finished a 3 match test series as well against South Africa?

==All Rounders Double==

This article states that the double is 3000 runs and 200 wickets, yet the Wiki Category for it states that it's 3000 runs and 300 wickets, a feat that only one NZ player, Richard Hadlee has achieved. [[User:Pottski|Pottski]]

Whether the definition is 200 or 300 wickets, Shane Warne needs to be added to the list (as he now has over 3000 test runs).

A quality allrounder is someone who has a higher batting average than their bowling average. There are far too many bowlers-who-can-bat-a-bit in the alllrounder lists simply because they have played so many games - even Muali has over 1000 runs. I suggest deleting all those players whose bowling average is higher than batting average.

== New link ==

I've just added a new external link to our NZHistory.net.nz feature on New Zealand cricket. It is written by a professional historian and includes images and videos. Let me know if there is a problem with this. Thanks.

== adding links to scorecards ==

I think it would be good to set up a new column in the &quot;first test&quot;, &quot;series&quot; and &quot;oneday&quot; wins verses each nation tables to link to the scorecards of these games. perhaps hyperlinking from a column with the game number? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/202.49.35.20|202.49.35.20]] ([[User talk:202.49.35.20|talk]]) 04:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

==Injury==
Given the injury list during the Cricket World Cup, is there a list of replacements?  I only know that Hamish Marshall replaced Lou Vincent.

==Current Squad==

The current squad should include players who played last seaosn and have a reasonable '''chance''' of playing for NZ in the upcoming season, not just those on a contract.

== Timing of Updates ==

This page is badly lacking in references (basically, each statistic should be linked to the relevant source, (which is nearly always cricinfo - finding a stat there without a direct link can be difficult).
Therefore, editors should refrain from updating statistics while a match is in progress. It would be best to wait until Cricinfo has updated, probably 24 hours after the conclusion of a game. That way we will avoid figures on the page being out of step with the sources. [[User:Dramatic|dramatic]] ([[User talk:Dramatic|talk]]) 00:22, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

== This article was the source of a news article ==

== Ross Taylor's appointment ==

Someone changed the article to note that Ross Taylor had been appointed the captain, but edited the article simply replacing Vettori with Taylor, leaving the article saying that Taylor replaced Fleming. I've quickly edited the article to make the transitions clearer, but the early part of the article now really required wordsmithing to make it better. There really isn't any need to have such an early paragraph discussing the achievements of a captain who is now 3 captains ago, in an article about the team, not a Fleming. Nor is Vettori's early loss really of particular note anymore.

The text currently reads:

'''The current Test, One-day and Twenty20 captain is Ross Taylor. Taylor replaced Daniel Vettori  after Vettori stepped down following the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. Vettori had replaced New Zealand's most successful captain, Stephen Fleming, who led New Zealand to 28 Test victories, more than twice as many as any other captain. Vettori lost his first match as captain (vs South Africa) by 358 runs, New Zealand's worst ever defeat by runs.'''

Perhaps something like the following would be better:
''The current Test, One-day and Twenty20 captain is Ross Taylor. Taylor replaced Daniel Vettori  after Vettori stepped down following the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. There have been 26 [[New Zealand national cricket captains]].''  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Fivey|Fivey]] ([[User talk:Fivey|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fivey|contribs]]) 05:21, 23 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
