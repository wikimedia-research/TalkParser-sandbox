A tag has been placed on [[:Dadaji thandai]], requesting that it be deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under two or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], by which articles can be deleted at any time, without discussion. If the page meets any of these strictly-defined criteria, then it may be soon be deleted by an administrator. The reasons it has been tagged are:
* It seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. (See [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information.
*It appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. (See [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. &lt;p&gt;If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. However, even if you use one of these processes to release copyrighted material to Wikipedia, it still needs to comply with the other [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] to be eligible for inclusion. If you would like any assistance with this, you can ask a question at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]].&lt;/p&gt; 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Dadaji thandai|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;.

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Dawnseeker2000|Dawnseeker2000]]. I wanted to let you know that I removed an external link you added&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Saffron]], because to me it seemed inappropriate for an encyclopedia. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Dawnseeker2000|my talk page]], or take a look at our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines]] about links.

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=Stop icon]] Your addition to [[:Thandai]] has been removed, as it appears to have added [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyrighted]] material to Wikipedia without [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|permission]] from the copyright holder.

For legal reasons, Wikipedia cannot accept copyrighted text, or images borrowed from other websites, or printed material without a verifiable license; such additions will be deleted. You may use external websites or publications as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''content'', such as sentences or images&amp;mdash;you must write using your own words.
