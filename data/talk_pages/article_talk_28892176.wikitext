[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left]]The article [[:Syed abu mohammad]] has been speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This was done because the article, which appeared to be about a real person, individual animal, organization (band, club, company, ''etc.''), or web content, did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the notability of the subject may be deleted at any time. If you can indicate why the subject is really notable, you are free to re-create the article, making sure to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|cite]] any [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable sources]].

Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], and for specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:MUSIC|for musicians]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn-deletion --&gt;  -- [[User:Gogo Dodo|Gogo Dodo]] ([[User talk:Gogo Dodo|talk]]) 18:11, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

== Don't panic! ==

Your article got moved to here: [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Syed Abu Mohammad]]

The article being deleted is just a left over side-effect from when it got moved. Don't worry about that.

A decision will be made on whether it is a subject eligible for an article. If it is then the proper article will be created. That said, I don't think you have explained why this person is [[WP:N|notable]], so you should try to add that to the moved article.
