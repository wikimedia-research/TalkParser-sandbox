This used to be an article that talked about [[professional certification]] and [[product certification]], in addition had MANY unrelated incoming links for meanings such as [[RIAA certification]], [[film certification]], [[digital signatures]].  Refactored the lot of it and made a disambig page.  &lt;span class=&quot;user-sig user-Quarl&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;mdash;[[User:Quarl|Quarl]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Quarl|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[2006-01-12]]&amp;nbsp;10:27[[ISO 8601|Z]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I can't possibly imagine that this one instance of &quot;Certification&quot; should get its own section.  It should be addressed in the list of examples down below.
