==Stub to start==
The article only needs a cast section to upgrade to start class. Once it's added, change the class to start. --[[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] 07:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

==Fair use rationale for Image:The prize moviep.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:The prize moviep.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:The prize moviep.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

== Cast ==

Isn't listing the entire cast a bit excessive?--[[Special:Contributions/213.191.70.184|213.191.70.184]] ([[User talk:213.191.70.184|talk]]) 02:58, 31 January 2011 (UTC)

== Influences and similarities ==

I have moved this entire section here because it appears to be pure [[WP:OR|original research]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The film has an overall Hitchcock-esque mood, bearing a few similarities to 1959's ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) and 1940's ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' in its use of mistaken identity and the idea of a distinguished professor being impersonated by a double. The scene on the bridge and in the nudist club in ''The Prize'' are most often mentioned. ''The Prize'' has further, troubling similarities to Hitchcock's earlier ''Foreign Correspondent'', many of them identical to the similarities that it has to ''North by Northwest'', in particular: (1) the hero's summoning of the police to the scene of a crime, only to have the body and criminals not present, creating the suspicion among the police that the hero (Huntley Haverstock in ''Foreign Correspondent'' and Roger Thornhill in ''North by Northwest'') are either unbalanced or clownish; (2) a false assassination or kidnapping (Van Meer in ''Foreign Correspondent'' and Max Stratman in ''The Prize'' (3) the use of identical doubles to advance the plot (Van Meer in ''Foreign Correspondent'' and Max Stratman in ''The Prize'' This raises the question as to whether the real issue of plagiarism isn't between Ernest Lehman's two screenplays, first for Hitchcock's ''North by Northwest'' and Mark Robson's ''The Prize'', but whether he lifted material in the first place, from the 1940 Hitchcock film ''Foreign Correspondent'' (which Lehman had nothing to do with) and his screenplay for ''North by Northwest'' in 1959. {{POV-statement|date=December 2011}}
