[[File:Information orange.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not add promotional material to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:User talk:NeilN]]. While [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|objective prose]] about beliefs, products or services ''is'' acceptable, Wikipedia is not intended to be [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox|a vehicle for soapboxing, advertising or promotion]].

If all you see in my statement is promotional material then you are truly blind and will inherit only the death of your soul, for those who see the light of my statement there is potential for ever-lasting life, but remember it is only an aid to finding your faith, it is not your or my salvation, only trust in Jesus Christ can provide that.

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Welcome to Wikipedia and thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Zxuiji|your contributions]]. I am glad to see that you are discussing a topic. However, as a [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|general rule]], talk pages such as [[User_talk:Zxuiji]] are for discussion related to improving the article, [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#FORUM|not general discussion]] about the topic or unrelated topics. If you have specific questions about certain topics, consider visiting [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|our reference desk]] and asking them there instead of on article talk pages. ''Zxuiji, Wikipedia is not a forum for you to &quot;save souls&quot;. It's an encyclopaedia, based on objective collaboration using reliably sourced materials. Also, telling a user that they are &quot;spiritually blind&quot; and destined for hell is not only soapboxing, but could also conceivably be considered a personal attack. Please, try to remain civil, keep your discussions with other editors relevant to content, and try to read up on those policies other editors and administrators provide links to. They're only trying to help you be a more constructive editor. Thank you.''&lt;!-- Template:uw-chat1 --&gt; [[User:Quinto Simmaco|Quinto Simmaco]] ([[User talk:Quinto Simmaco|talk]]) 00:20, 8 March 2015 (UTC)

There was nothing &quot;General&quot; about the topic, here's the simplified version of what I wrote:
Fact: Existence is infinite in all directions it can go (even if we haven't yet discovered those directions)
Fact: The motion of time is infinite in the only 2 directions it can go
Fact: Given the above facts it is thus &lt;b&gt;IMPOSSIBLE&lt;/b&gt; for the God described by his Holy Bible to &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; exist, it then stands to reason that such a God who loves us all so much really would send his only begotten son to sacrifice himself for &lt;b&gt;our sins&lt;/b&gt; (whether we notice those sins or not) for only they can truly see how badly we need a saviour.
