{{divbox|gray|&lt;!-- no title --&gt;|To have a Wikipedia article a program must be &quot;noteworthy&quot;. That means that is must already be widely known outside of Wikipedia. To show this you must provide references to articles ABOUT the program that are independent of the program. Is there newspaper coverage outside of the university town. Has it been nationally noticed. Has it received awards?

Also this is written like publicity material, not an encyclopedia article.[[Category:AfC submissions declined with a custom reason]]|}} Please check the submission for any additional comments left by the reviewer.
