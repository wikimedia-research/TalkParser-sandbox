Hi! Thanks for uploading the following image:

*[[:Image:Dolla.jpg]]

I notice it currently doesn't have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image copyright tag]]. Could you add one to let us know its [[copyright]] status? (You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{gfdl}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you release it under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fairuse}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you claim [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], etc.) If you don't know what any of this means, just ''let me know [[User talk:Poccil|at my talk page]]'' where you got the images and I'll tag them for you. Thanks so much. [[User:Poccil|[[User:Poccil|Peter O.]] ([[User Talk:Poccil|Talk]], [[User:Poccil/Automation.js|automation script]])]] 04:31, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)

P.S.  You can help tag other images at [[User:Yann/Untagged_Images]].  Thanks again.
