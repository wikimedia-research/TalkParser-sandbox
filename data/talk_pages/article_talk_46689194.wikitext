== Dominant language: Canadian english was hardly used in the war ==

There were numerous small battles in Canada but apart from Thames the big ones &amp; major activity were elsewhere &amp; at sea. Only a small minority of the soldiers &amp; sailors spoke Canadian English. None of the main players, political leaders or military commanders were Canadian. The dispatches, speeches, orders, communications between the two sides, treaties etc were not written in Canadian English.  &quot;Canadian English&quot; barely even existed in 1812.  That makes it a very weak 3rd place behind US English and British English. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 23:57, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
:English was not the principal language used during the [[Gallic Wars]] but the Wikipedia article is written in English. Wikipedia has a policy about which version of English to use and that changes should not be made arbitrarily. If you look at the top of the Talk page you will see
{{Canadian English}}
:Changes from the use of Canadian English should not therefore be made according to [[Wikipedia:ENGVAR]] unless some attempt has been made to establish that broad consensus and suitable grounds for that chanmge can be argued.

::I thought I recalled a discussion in the Archives, so I checked and found this [[Talk:War_of_1812/Archive_16#WP:ENGVAR]] which summarises why the decision was made that this should be in Canadian English spelling. [[User:Dabbler|Dabbler]] ([[User talk:Dabbler|talk]]) 00:42, 7 October 2014 (UTC)
::::I fully concur with Rjensen's analysis here. This war was declared by the US Congress on June 18, 1812 against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, ''not''  Upper and Lower Canada known until 1867 as ''British'' North America. This was the first of only five wars ever formally declared by the United States Congress against foreign powers. (The Mexican War in 1846, Spanish-American War in 1898, and entry in WWI in 1917 and WWII in 1941 were the others.)

::::The only two named parties to the [[Treaty of Ghent]] concluded on December 24, 1814 and ratified unanimously by the Senate on February 16, 1815 to end the war were &quot;his Britannic Majesty&quot; (George III) on behalf of the United Kingdom, and the United States. British North America was not a party to the Treaty nor is &quot;Canada&quot; on &quot;British North America&quot; mentioned anywhere in its [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ghent.asp text]. Also nowhere else in this Wikipedia entry on the War of 1812 is &quot;Canadian&quot; or Commonwealth English, spelling, or date formatting used. That being the case, I believe that it is time to reconsider the use of &quot;Canadian&quot; English in the article and reach consensus as to whether it makes any sense to use it in this entry. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 00:55, 7 October 2014 (UTC) 
:::::I agree with Dabbler that change should not be made without consensus as has been done. Treaty participation is hardly relevant; for example, no English-speaking nation signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but the article is still in English. Also, see [[Wp:Retain]].

::::::*Using as an argument that &quot;Canadian&quot; English should be used in an article about a war between the United States and Great Britain fought mostly at sea and in US which included its most important engagements in such places as Baltimore (which is the subject of the US National Anthem), in Washington, DC with the burning of the White House and sacking of the Capitol, and as far south as New Orleans, simply because there ''also'' were some skirmishes in what is now Canada which came about by the invasion of US forces really just does not make sense to me. Based on that &quot;logic&quot;, could it not be equally argued that the Wikipedia article on the [[American Revolutionary War]] should ''also'' employ &quot;Canadian&quot; English because the first major military actions of the war authorized by the Continental Congress and carried out by American troops came from a major [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] beginning in May, 1775 and lasting until October, 1776? This included an occupation of Montreal and siege of Quebec with more than 10,000 American troops involved in these actions. Americans also regularly attacked Nova Scotia and Halifax by both land and sea throughout the course of the war including the Battle of Halifax in May, 1782 and the Raid on Lunenburg in July, 1782.

::::::*I assume, however, that there are no editors in Wikipedia that would ever think it reasonable to propose that &quot;Canadian&quot; English should be used for WP's entry on the American Revolutionary War, and with that being the case my question to the community is what is so different about the War of 1812 that anybody at all thinks that American English is the wrong choice for that article about a war between the same two protagonists -- the US and Great Britain -- fought in virtually the same territory? I really just don't see the logic in that at all. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 03:23, 7 October 2014 (UTC)
::two points: The rule about the original style chosen by the first editor is not helpful, because the original Wikipedia 1812 article was not written by a Wikipedia editor – it was cut and pasted in a mechanical fashion from the Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1910 as part of a massive cut-and-paste effort.  That Encyclopedia, although edited and owned in Chicago, favoured British spellings.  The second point is that Canadian English is a blend of British and American styles. &quot;The feature that may be most distinctive about Canadian English writers and readers is there calm acceptance, even in the same sentence, of both American and British forms&quot; say  Fee and McAlpine in ''Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage'' (1997) p xi.  That is, people who want to use Canadian English are favoring a composite of the British and American variations. For myself I favour that composite here. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 03:55, 7 October 2014 (UTC)
::*My point above is that the War of 1812 is ''far'' more associated with the United States than it is with Canada in that it was a war ''declared'' by the US Congress and its major engagements were fought on US soil or at sea between American and British forces. Those skirmishes that took place in British North America (as Canada was known as until 1867) were the result of the invasion of those areas by US forces.

The status quo is Canadian English as stated at the top of this Talk page. Wkipedia MOS says that this should only be changed if there is a strong consensus to do so. So far I have not seen much demand to change the status quo and am therefore in favour of retaining Canadian English, which has an advantage for me in that it is quite easy for me as a British born Canadian to use ;-).

::::::: I don't really have an issue with the language variety one way or another, but the war was not fought mostly in the US and at sea. Canada was the main theatre of war until 1814, when the British were for the first time able to go on the offensive. The most important campaigns - in that they dictated the war would continue for three years rather than coming to a quick end - like Detroit and Queenston Heights, were fought in Canada. So basing one's decision entirely on that - as Centpacrr has done - is a mistake. Also, the war is at least equally, if not more, significant in Canada than the US, because it makes a good national myth for the Harper gov. [[User:Rwenonah|Rwenonah]] ([[User talk:Rwenonah|talk]]) 22:14, 7 October 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::Perhaps we have a Canadian who has never heard of New Orleans (LA), Baltimore (MD), the blockade (coast), Plattsburgh (NY) or the Battle of Lake Erie (OH), and believes that Detroit used to be in Canada instead of Michigan. A bunch of little skirmishes that together were far smaller than New Orleans does in deed make up the Canadian mythology of the war, but that's not quite the whole story. For example there is a shortage of Canadian military or political leaders--the commands were given in British English.  I suggest that at the time that half or more of the &quot;Canadians&quot; (if we can use the term) did not speak English of any kind, and most of the rest grew up in American colonies and spoke an American version of English they brought with them when they came in the 1783-1812 era.

::::::::::Dabbler, as Rjensen pointed out above, the so called &quot;establishment&quot; of the English variant for the original War of 1812 article was purely arbitrary as it ''&quot;was not written by a Wikipedia editor – it was cut and pasted in a mechanical fashion from the Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1910 as part of a massive cut-and-paste effort.&quot;'' This hardly seems to be a persuasive or logical basis to retain &quot;Canadian&quot; English for an article about a war declared by the United States against the UK. [[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 22:48, October 7, 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::So ... Canadian's didn't speak Canadian English at the time. Not really relevant. No one in the Roman Empire spoke English, yet the article is still written in that language. It's clear that Americnas or British didn't speak our modern-day conception of American or British English at the time either; to say that &quot;commands were given in British English&quot; is to ignore that language has a tendency to change over 200+ years, something a historical article (or historian) should keep in mind. Perhaps we have an American who has never heard of Crysler's Farm (QC), Stoney Creek (ON), Moraviantown (ON), Chippawa (ON), or Lundy's Lane (ON), actually the bloodiest battle in North America until the Civil War. All participants were aware that Canada constituted the main front of the war, especially until 1814. Furthermore, the key point is that Canada has taken a great deal more action to commemorate the war, as well as popularize it. The American national myth is equally inaccurate, but less well known (hence, I think the reason you mentioned Lake Erie while discarding Bladensburg). [[User:Rwenonah|Rwenonah]] ([[User talk:Rwenonah|talk]]) 00:15, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
It should remain at Canadian English per [[WP:ENGVAR]]. There really isn't a valid reason to change it under current policy. [[User:Calidum|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002244; font-family:serif&quot;&gt;'''-- ''Calidum'''''&lt;/span&gt;]] 00:32, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
:::Goodness were these the bloodiest of all battles in North America? No, only in Canadian history.  At Lundy's Lane, 260 soldiers were killed on both sides, at Crysler's Farm 133 were killed, at Stony Creek, 39 were killed on both sides, at Moraviantown about 60, and at Chippawa about 170. Thus maybe 680 in all the major battles in Canada.  At New Orleans the British alone had about 390 killed and 550 &quot;missing&quot; and never recovered (and 150 Americans).  Now as pointed out before &quot;Canadian usage&quot; allows a MIX of both US and British forms, which seems ok to me. &quot;The feature that may be most distinctive about Canadian English writers and readers is their calm acceptance, even in the same sentence, of both American and British forms&quot; [''Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage''] [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 00:39, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
::::WP:MOS states at [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Strong_national_ties_to_a_topic|section 2.3]] that &quot;An article on a topic that has '''''strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation'' should use the English ''of that nation''&quot;.''' Simply because the first posting was arbitrarily not in American English because its text consisted of &quot;cut and paste&quot; material plagiarized from the 1910 Encyclopedia Britannica is no reason not to repair that error and follow the &quot;strong ties&quot; policy. The insistence that such an error should never be subject to correction seems to me in this case to be little more than jingoistic wikilawyering.

Thank you for your contribution, of the five editors who have contributed to this discussion so far, three or four (I think [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] is in favour) support the continued use of Canadian English at least until there is a strong consensus that it should not be used.

::::My observation is not intended to be abusive but is based on the impression left by the comments above that imply a view that &quot;Canadian&quot; English should be retained because the War of 1812 is a &quot;big deal&quot; to Canadians and &quot;ignored&quot; by Americans. Really? With respect, that really seems to be pretty thin, highly subjective, and factually unsupportable reasoning in this case. As I mentioned above, the US National Anthem, &quot;[[The Star Spangled Banner]]&quot; is derived from a key action in the War, the siege of [[Fort McHenry]] in Baltimore on September 13-14, 1814, and the flag itself is one of the nation's most important icons. While there were engagements that took place in Canada (British North America), they were the result of US forces going there to engage British interests there in a war declared by the US (the first of only five to ever be declared by the US Congress), not Canada or the UK. The war also involved the burning of the White House and sacking of the Capitol in Washington, no small thing to the US. It could logically be said that the War of 1812 was declared and fought to clean up issues and consequences left unresolved with the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] which ''also'' had significant engagements in what is now Canada but this article correctly employs American English.  None of the comments posted by others above, however, have really yet addressed the specifics of the points I have made, the tenants of [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Strong_national_ties_to_a_topic|section 2.3]] of WP:MOS, and the arbitrariness of how the wrong original English variant was &quot;established&quot; to begin with. It would be helpful in resolving this issue if the other editors commenting would do so.[[User:Centpacrr|Centpacrr]] ([[User talk:Centpacrr|talk]]) 14:42, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
:::::For what it is worth, my attitde is still based on the policy rather than any attempt to claim that the war is more important to any one side. For a start, I do not believe that drawing on that claim is really valid in a case when at least two of the regions involved consider to be existential. As a result I stand by the status quo. However, the decision was arrived at, it was established and, until now, not really challenged that Canadian English, as a variant which allows for both American and British spellings to be used in some cases was suitable for an article which involves American, British and, yes, Canadian interest to a greater or lesser extent. As for your reasons why you consider the war to be peculiarly American, may I suggest that you look at it from another point of view. While you can point to the US flag and national anthem as reasons why this war was so important to the US, Canadians point to the local militia's defence against perceived American imperialism and the  resistance to American invasions which ensured the separate existence of a country that eventually became Canada. Until the eventual adoption of the anodyne ''O Canada'' as the official national anthem, English Canada's unofficial anthem was ''[[The Maple Leaf Forever]]'' which draws just as strongly on War of 1812 mythology as ''The Star Spangled Banner''. Toronto, see [[Battle of York]], was the scene of the looting and burning of the provincial parliament buildings and the theft of the Speaker's mace, only returned in the next century, which, in part, was the reason why the Royal Navy burned the public buildings of Washington. It seems to me to be unacceptable to claim that only one side in a war was important and to dismiss the colonists of Upper and Lower Canada and Nova Scotia as irrelevant to the war and its outcome.

:::I agree with Dabbler that the page should use the &quot;Canadian&quot; style, which allows both American and British spelling. However I disagree that it is central to Canadian identity.

::::I would agree with your contention that it is not &quot;central&quot; to the Canadian identity. However, it is more than just of importance to &quot;British Canada&quot;. For a start, Quebecois militia also played an important role in the defence of Lower Canada. While it is probably more important to what is left of British Canada, that is a still a large number of people. The war is still considered an important part of the founding history/myth of Canada as a country which is part of the Commonwealth and more importantly separate from the US. It, along with Vimy Ridge, is one of the few historical military events that is still covered in Canadian school history classes.

That said, very few people, excepting historians or (In Canada's case) the government, really care or pay attention to the war today in either country. So to say that the war is central to any Canadian conception of national identity is somewhat false. In the US, the Revolutionary War generally makes a more convenient national myth. Only certain aspects of the 1812 war are noticed (like the fiction of Dolly Madison saving the paintings in the burning of the White House), but primarily the three main battles in the US, Baltimore, New Orleans and Plattsburgh.

* Good God.  If there are valid competing varieties of English, then [[WP:TIES]] cannot possibly be applied—either to defend CanEng, or to oppose it.  TIES is ''only'' for clearest cut of cases, so that [[New York City]] doesn't end up in Australian English or [[Mumbai]] in American English.

If the article is in CanEng, per the MOS ([[MOS:RETAIN]]) it should stay that way unless it can be shown to do harm; having said that, [[MOS:COMMONALITY]] should trump any outright Canadianisms (&quot;riding&quot;, &quot;chesterfield&quot;), and preference should be given to those spellings that are common between the two varieties (preferring &quot;-ize&quot; even if &quot;-ise&quot; is sometimes considered acceptable in CanEng).  This is ''not'', of course, because CanEng is more appropriate in any way, but only because it is ''established''—the whole point of ENGVAR and RETAIN is to ''avoid'' these ridiculous time-draining &quot;discussions&quot;.

== not good summary of war and peace ==

I believe the summary needs to be changed .As numerous battles are mentioned twice such as New Orleans and south west Indian defeats. Whereas other battles if not more important are not mentioned at all such as the battle of Chryslers farm or Stoney creek and fort bowyer.

While Ghent summary is not sufficient as it is .As pressure from British government(worried about Europe)on British diplomats was the primary reason for them to drop their demands to get the war over and done with. While the summary fails to mention American demands made at Ghent such as there demands to change British maritime belligerent rights which was main cause of war and even demands on Canadian territory . However summary is a bit one sided and only stats that Britain asked for demands.

:Firstly, any change to the summary needs to be packed up by [[Wp:RS|published, reliable sources]], of which you have presented none supporting your views on the war. Crysler's Farm and Fort Bowyer were both relatively insignificant in terms of the larger conflict, and definitely don't deserve a place in the lede. Stoney Creek might, but in my opinion the summary is already bloated,a nd we should be considering ways to trim it rather than expand it. Many of the battles were added by another editor without consensus some time ago. Insofar as I know, the US made no claims on Canadian territory or demands to change British maritime regulations (other than impressment, which can hardly be called a &quot;right&quot;). American diplomats were fully aware that their country was risking defeat following the end of the Napoleonic Wars; after 1814, the US no longer expected victory.

Tirronan if you mean the treaty of Ghent which was my last non minor edit. This  was a while ago and there was discussion and sources involved and if have deleted them non the less you should revert the American demands back to what they were, as I displayed these sources for the demands made

:::I think we covered this before, Benn and Lambert are not RS on diplomacy (their research has been on military &amp; naval history--diplomacy is a different field); they spend little attention on it &amp; they garbled the secondary sources. For example, the US delegation did NOT present the demands drawn up in Washington at Ghent, as all the diplomatic historian since 1890 have said (see note 165) [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 17:00, 2 October 2014 (UTC)

Hickey makes clear that Lambert is a good NAVAL historian but is poor on political and diplomatic topics. Lambert the suffers from a common problem: &quot;a problem common among military historians—a poor grasp of the all-important political and diplomatic background of the military actions they seek to explain.&quot;  Hickey attacks Lambert's poor grasp of numerous points: &quot;Lambert makes dubious and erroneous claims about the causes of the war.&quot;  &quot;Lambert also makes sketchy claims about the end and aftermath of the war....Lambert insists that, in the peace negotiations, 'Americans conceded Britain's core war aims, maritime belligerent rights and impressment, at the outset,' and that the Treaty of Ghent 'upheld British maritime rights.' But the treaty did not mention these issues, which remained open questions and the subject of subsequent diplomatic exchanges.&quot; &quot;These are but a sampling of Lambert's errors and dubious claims. They suggest a penchant, especially when dealing with American topics, to make airy generalizations and deliver questionable judgments without looking at the evidence.&quot;.  see  Donald R. Hickey, &quot;'The Bully Has Been Disgraced by an Infant'—The Naval War of 1812,&quot; ''Michigan War Studies Review'' (2014) 2014-097 [http://www.miwsr.com/2014-097.aspx online] [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 02:40, 3 October 2014 (UTC)

::I think Lambert stating that Ghent upheld British maritime rights possibly could mean that because US diplomats not challenging this at Ghent( according to hicky) this ,therefore results in them being upheld . Which may answer this question [[User:Imperialredcoat|Imperialredcoat]] ([[User talk:Imperialredcoat|talk]]) 21:11, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
:::No--Hickey makes clear that Lambert is all mixed up --and doubly so if Lambert he thinks when a treaty is silent on XYZ that means it upholds the former British position on XYZ. Actually the British had decided not to use impressment against American ships, which was the US demand (Brits did not give up the right to use impressment on BRITISH merchant ships, but that was never at issue in the war). [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 22:30, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
::::Well, the British never de jure ''gave it up'', per the US demand; to the end of the war and onward, they maintained they had the right to search American ships for British deserters (they never actually wanted to impress American sailors). However, this was moot while the two countries were at war, and afterward, with the Napoleonic wars over, the British had no further need for sailors, meaning that the issue never came up again. [[User:Rwenonah|Rwenonah]] ([[User talk:Rwenonah|talk]]) 23:13, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
::::::The American goal was not some sort of written promise by Britain but an actual end to impressment. The end actually and permanently happened in 1814 before the treaty was written. Is that success or failure? I'd call it achieving the war goal. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 23:45, 6 October 2014 (UTC) 
::::::: Yes, but impressment was always an extreme for Britain - something it only did when it desperately needed sailors. The &quot;permanent&quot; end only happened because Britain no longer needed sailors, meaning it had no need to continue impressment. The fact it was permanent is only due to the fact that Britain wasn't in another life-and-death war over the next 100 years (before maritime rights became generally accepted). If Napoleon had successfully been reinstalled as Emperor of France in the Hundred days, resulting in another ten years of war, Britain would have resumed taking deserters off American ships (possibly with more tact). There is a difference between a war goal is only achieved if events change because of the war, rather than a coincidental end only due to a long period of peace. In other words, American actions didn't change impressment; it was a historical coincidence. [[User:Rwenonah|Rwenonah]] ([[User talk:Rwenonah|talk]]) 23:52, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
::::::::Actually Ian Toll states that the British Navy was at pains to make sure no US ship was stopped and no sailors were impressed during the hundred days when the same horrific pressures for sailors existed. While the right of impressment was never given up by the British Navy, in practice, American ships were left strictly alone and stopping and impressing of US ships fact ended. I wanted to address another issue brought up here in this section. If you dig but just a little, there are letters from impressed American sailors to their fathers in the record. British naval captains were not always all that picky about who they impressed so long as they could speak English. Documentation to such also exists. The fact that American accents and dress were virtually identical to Britons also made this more difficult. All this was dependent on the British commander so the actual truth varied widely by warship. That being said it was a rare capture where impressed Americans were not found on British warships. True black and white lines are rare in any war and the issue of impressment was very murky indeed. Nations do what is in their best interest and another war with America made no sense at all at this point in time.

In the first section, paragraph 3, sentence 6, where the article is on the topic of Gen. Andrew Jackson and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, the information there is inaccurate. It states that The Battle of Horseshoe Bend took place in the Southwest. Horseshoe Bend is in Alabama near the town of Dadeville. Alabama is in the Southeast, not southwest.

Regarding President Madison and The Battle of Bladensberg. Source: A New American History, by W.E. Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;A New American History, W.E. WoordwarGarden City Publishing Co., 1936.d, &lt;/ref&gt; In the description of the war Woodward creates a portrait of Madison and the &quot;muddled situation&quot; he was involved in prior to the war. This section would benefit from expansion. In addition, the Battle of Bladensberg is poorly characterized. Woodward says that it was called the &quot;Bladensberg Races&quot; fought mainly by miltia who fled &quot;in a senseless panic, every man racing against his comrades on the road to Washington.&quot; Woodward also describes the Army, American, as only 7,000 strong commanded by old men from the American Revolution. Finally, there is no mention of the John Henry/Count de Crillon episode that fed into the &quot;war Hawks&quot; desire for war. This episode is essential in understanding the tone of the nation prior to declaring war.

::W.E. Woodward Was a popular author in the 1920s, famous for debunking heroes in American history. He never published any serious scholarly work, and historians have not cited him in  75+  years.
