==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:University College Hockey Club]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:University College Hockey Club]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a club, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific notability guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|people]] and for [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|organizations]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:University College Hockey Club|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:University College Hockey Club|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-club-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Codf1977|Codf1977]] ([[User talk:Codf1977|talk]]) 16:27, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== August 2010 ==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop removing [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] notices from pages that you have created yourself, as you did with [[:University College Hockey Club]]. If you continue, you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. &lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy3 --&gt; [[User:Codf1977|Codf1977]] ([[User talk:Codf1977|talk]]) 16:55, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
