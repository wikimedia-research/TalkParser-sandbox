[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]
A [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] template has been added to the article [[Afraid to Dream]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice should explain why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; &lt;b&gt;[[User:Jauerback|Jauerback]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jauerback|dude?]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Jauerback|dude.]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:03, 14 October 2008 (UTC)
