{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Jommel rendon]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A3|section A3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an article with no content whatsoever, or whose contents consist only of external links, a &quot;See also&quot; section, book references, category tags, template tags, interwiki links, a rephrasing of the title, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Jommel rendon|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontent-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Thebestofall007|Thebestofall007]] ([[User talk:Thebestofall007|talk]]) 18:20, 3 September 2012 (UTC)
