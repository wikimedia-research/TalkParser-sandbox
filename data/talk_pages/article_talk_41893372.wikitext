==Speedy deletion==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] A tag has been placed on {{#if:Kaiperambalur|[[:Kaiperambalur]]|a page you created}} requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia, because it appears to be a [[WP:CSD#G4|repost of material that was previously deleted]] following a [[Wikipedia:Deletion discussions|deletion process]]. If you can indicate how it is different from the previously posted material, place the template {{tl|hang on}} '''underneath''' the other template on the article and put a note on the page's [[Wikipedia:Talk page|discussion page]] saying why this article should stay. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page. If you believe the original discussion was unjustified, please contact the administrator who deleted the page or use [[WP:Deletion review|deletion review]] instead of continuing to recreate the page. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template: Uw-repost --&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JoeSperrazza|JoeSperrazza]] ([[User talk:JoeSperrazza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JoeSperrazza|contribs]]) 19:47, December 31, 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

*It is probably worth merging this page with [[Thungapuram]], as they appear to be copies of each other. Thungapuram is the proper name of the village according to the Indian postal service. &lt;small&gt;20:30, 4 June 2013‎ (UTC) [[User:Jebobjebob]]&lt;/small&gt;
* According to [[Google Earth]], [[Kaiperambalur]] http://goo.gl/maps/Oxwgp and [[Thungapuram]] http://goo.gl/maps/h5w2i are two distinct places. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 20:38, 9 February 2014 (UTC)
