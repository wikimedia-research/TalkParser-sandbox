As you appear to know something about the series [[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)]], I ask that you heed the banners on the article that indicate the plot section is ALREADY TOO LONG AND DETAILED and attempt to condense the content to a readable summary that simply includes the major highpoints. Thanks for your help![[Special:Contributions/Active_Banana|''Active'']] [[User:Active Banana|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''Banana&lt;/font&gt;''']]  [[User talk:Active Banana|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;''bananaphone''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:35, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
