==Fair use rationale for [[:Image:Aliso Niguel logo.gif]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
Thanks for uploading or contributing to '''[[:Image:Aliso Niguel logo.gif]]'''. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is not a suitable explanation or rationale as to why each specific use in Wikipedia constitutes fair use.  Please go to [[:Image:Aliso Niguel logo.gif|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|fair use rationale]].

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-no fair use rationale-notice --&gt; NOTE: once you correct this, please remove the tag from the image's page. [[User:STBotI|STBotI]] 21:32, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

==thanks for your note==

You might ask your fellow students why they think the book is so negative. Both the good characters AND the bad characters are all students at the school. There are as many good kids as bad. I find it interesting that some of you have chosen to identify ONLY with the bad guys. Why not identify with Paski, Tina, Chris, Kerani, Keoni, Haley, or Sydney? There are really only two bad kids in the entire book, Jessica and Chad.

It is tough being in high school. Peer pressure is overwhelming, and I'd imagine that if it were suddenly &quot;cool&quot; at your school to hate me, then kids would jump on the bandwagon.

But if your goal is to show that students at your school are NOT petty, mean, nasty or cruel, attacking an author on Wikipedia, without having read the book, is not a good way to do it. You simply end up strengthening the very allegation you are trying to disprove - ie, you show yourselves to be hateful while demanding to be seen otherwise.

Here in Phoenix, public school already began.

I would be happy to send you a signed copy of the paperback in the spring. You can judge for yourself.

Alisa

==Exit lists==
&quot;This column is optional for routes that are within a single county.&quot; --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 16:54, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

What's messed up? --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 16:59, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, you did. Please show me what's messed up. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:01, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

::Yes; it looks fine to me. Try reloading the page; I recently screwed up [[template:jct]] for about a minute while editing it. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:03, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:::[[Wikipedia:Be bold]] agrees with my decision; there's no need to include a column when it applies to the whole route. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:10, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

I already explained it; there's no need to include a column that applies to the whole route. You're needlessly [[Wikipedia:wikilawyering|wikilawyering]]; please stop. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:14, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

Uh... you added the column to both. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:18, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

Wikipedia is often not consistent. That's not necessarily a good or bad thing. Note that there is a featured article - [[Kansas Turnpike]] - that doesn't even have an exit list. --[[User talk:NE2|NE2]] 17:22, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

==Removing stuff from your talk page==

==Interstate 98==
A {{[[Template:prod|prod]]}} template has been added to the article [[Interstate 98]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice explains why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dated prod}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:Interstate 98|its talk page]]. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached. If you endorse deletion of the article, and you are the only person who has made substantial edits to the page, please tag it with {{tl|db-author}}.

== State specific Interstate sheilds on main routes ==

Please do not add State Specific interstate shields to the main interstate highway articles such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstate_80&amp;curid=84143&amp;diff=156621494&amp;oldid=155966599 here].  These are to be used on state detailed articles like [[Interstate 80 in California]].  The main routes need to be neutral to the country as far as the shields are concerned.
