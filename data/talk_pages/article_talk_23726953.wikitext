== More accurate details needed re age of existing buildings ==

This article refers to the long history of Wuzhen (2,000 years of history; possibly populated for 7,000 years).  The tone of the article and the implication from the article is that the buildings, bridges and other structures one sees today are similarly ancient.  Although the site of Wuzhen town is ancient and apparently the layout of the existing town is the same as in ancient times, many of the current buildings are relatively new given the long history of Wuzhen town. This is confirmed in the submission dated 28 March 2008 to UNESCO by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of China which states that the buildings and other structures in Wuzhen preserve &quot;the layout and settings in the late Chinese Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China period.&quot;  [http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5328] I noted this as well in Wuzhen this week - the details provided on site in Wuzhen indicate that many of the buildings on the main tourist route were first constructed in the late 1800's or early 1900's and, further, have been rebuilt or restored recently.  Although the article refers to certain buildings in Wuzhen which were constructed in the 19th century, more discussion is needed to accurately convey the current status of Wuzhen.
