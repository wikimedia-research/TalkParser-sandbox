*I am SO sorry if this is too long if it is, please leave me a note and I will edit it... but it is my belief that I have seen longer talk pages so just leave me a message. Thank you.
*oh and here's a nice link to know... [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Famous Wikipedians]]
*and this (I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this concept!) [[Wikipedia:IPs_are_human_too]]

This is all me speaking.
If you would like to speak put your comment on the bottom of the page with 4 [[Tilde|tildes]] and a signature

==Introduction==
*I'm not a REAAAAAL account...
*Well, i try to be :D
*Oh cool i just noticed! My laptop is the same IP as the desktop! I was scared I was going to get banned for vandalism for editing the desktop's profile on the laptop X3

*I like using wiki terms although IPers tend to be like &quot;No, we can't make a talk page! I don't have an account!&quot;
Well, you can! That's great... I can feel like I'm part of Wikipedia at least a bit!
So it's like renting a movie instead of buying it!

*Ok, now i'm going to tell you my personal history on wikipedia.

*Disclaimer before reading next section: I am not trying to manipulate any positions, I don't mind if I never get an account, I just want to proclaim my history of being on Wikipedia, please don't act irrationally.
==So, why do I NOT have an account?==

*You know how some bots are kind of stingy like that and they'll like ban you for apparent sock-puppetry because the last edit you made on the older account (I made a dormant account to make an edit on an article, and didn't use it again for two years and forgot the username AND password therefore it is dormant currently...) was from two years ago and..... so you have two accounts and you get banned in two hours by a bot.. it's alright though.

*You know?

*Well yeah that's what happened.... and I got banished to the eh.... i would say uh its not the underworld of Wikipedia its like
earth? Limbo? Space? Vacuum?
Because banning the IP means you can't edit and THAT would be the wiki underworld. Logic?

==Questions For Mrs. Ms. or Mr. Admin==

*Well, so I am now an IPer. So. If there is an admin reading this (And if there is, nice to meet you I'm an IP, say hello :3) then I would like to ask them to delete the dormant and blocked-because-of-the-dormant-account accounts I created in the last two years

so i can start clean and start editing like a REAL account

and get spirited away to the Wikiheavens of editor status

And please please please if that seemed like a statement that you consider like something a vandal would write or of the like 
PLEASE do not drop the ban-hammer because (Check my IP activity -.-) I have never vandalized ANYTHING, I just have one dormant account I'm trying to get rid of and this other account that got banned because of the dormant account that I'm trying to get rid of because it makes me look like a what is the name? sock-puppeteer.

D'accord?

==Other Facts==

My blarg is done.
Other things about me are:

*I'm Canadian-American... 
*I would like to be in a WikiProject
*I love Japanese culture
*I know some french
*I live in the Mid-Atlantic Seaboard
*I am an IPer (I guess I'm proud of it, too?)

And So, This is THE AWESOME IPER!

==Contributions and a Farewell==

I've made X amount of contributions (as of 2013, 20 :D NEW RECORD!!!!!)

AND THEY ALL GOT ACCEPTED ;D
well because they're all on talk pages :3
suggestions? I make them.

*My user page is actually not red-linked. It's rose-linked because I have an IP. Differences.

So, I bid you good day for visiting this half-account, half IPer
annnnnd see you later on the amazing virtual library we all call...

WIKIPEDIA!

*i like history and geography, did i mention?

==Userboxes :D==
{{Template:User expat canadians in US}}

== More Random Stuff ==
Today I visited a page about DC to find an edit from an admin so i went to her page and visited her tools which was an edit war database
and so i see the biggest edit war of all time! I look at it, and I'm like: &quot;Look at all the banned users!&quot; or &quot;So many retirees!&quot; and then i find this dude named &quot;The Fat Man Who Never Came Back.&quot; Curious name... So I go on his page and I see this long description of trolling and constructiveness. Basically his whole WikiLife. So I realize here that you can make so many friends and enemies on wikipedia! And I see all the things this guy has done, etc. I'm in wonder. People live such a hard life on Wikipedia. I didn't know that. There are good times and bad times, and I guess I'm in the bad times. But if you look at most users, they've pushed through blocks and brought themselves up to a nice position. There was this one photographer who was blocked and is now a sensible editor. So I think that I should maybe give this a second try and attempt to get the dormant accounts removed. Oh, I also realized how much vandalism is actually on Wikipedia! Like, really? I think that if I was a full-fledged editor, I'd want to keep that position with my life! (exaggeration.) Do people value their accounts? If they don't, then that's terrible. So my editing has gone well, no retorts, no problems.. I think that all is going as planned! I try suggest things on talk pages, as editing an article is kind of scary! (What if the admin doesn't like your edit?!) So yeah! I don't think many people are reading this, but for those who are, Hello! I don't bite, i hope you don't too! And I look forward to continuing a long time making small improvements on WIKIPEDIA! Also, I'm never retiring :D....

== Edit Conflict ===
What is this madness called an edit conflict DX
here u can see mah edits if u like
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lists_of_English_loanwords_by_country_or_language_of_origin
hmm i dont think I did anything wrong hopefully

== Should I request an unblock? ==

I haven't made any sort of offence in all of the edits I've made since being demoted from a full user because I don't know why. So, if anyone's reading this, maybe you can look at my edits or the asks for me to be unblocked (Dontbitethenewcomer was my original account, i got demoted for sockpuppeting, see my talk page if you must learn more....) and see if I should go for it and try to become a full user!

I really want to become a real user again, and I don't know why I got banned....
So yeah!

==Question?==
Um, How long is the block? Just wondering...... If you guys don't want me to make an account again, fine but I want to at least be able to edit....... Please.... I haven't made any harmful edits at all.....

'':Please read [[WP:EVADE]], which is why you are blocked, and [[WP:GAB]] which contans advice on how to properly appeal a block. (hint:I want to edit&quot; is not a compelling explanation for why you have repeatedly evaded a block) [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 17:46, 20 April 2013 (UTC)''
::Um, I wasn't appealing (I know how to do that....) for an unblock, rather asking how long the ban was. Can you at least tell me that?
'':::Doesn't really matter. You, the person behind the accounts that are blocked, are not welcome to edit '''under any identity''' until the block on your original account has been lifted. If you evade the block again after the temporary block on this IP expires, you will just get blocked again. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:12, 20 April 2013 (UTC)''
::::You seem to be misunderstanding my original question. '''How long is the temporary block on this IP for''' ? Seriously, I thought that would be obvious. Can you just answer that question so I'm a little bit less confused?
'':::::It doesn't matter how long the temporary block is because you are not supposed to be editing Wikipedia at all whether this IP is blocked or not. So, as far as you, the individual currently  using this IP are concerned, the block is indefinite, until such time as the block on your original named account is lifted. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 19:44, 20 April 2013 (UTC)''
::::::Why can't I edit using an IP? I've been doing it for the last 5 months and I can't see why I can't edit now. When I previously joined wikipedia, I got blocked and resumed editing on this IP... there was never a problem and I never made any harmful edits. I don't see a problem in resuming this, as I haven't done anything harmful at all to Wikipedia's contents. Ever.
In fact, the only edits I've made, EVER, have been done on talk pages to small grammatical errors. How is that a problem?

''*If you hadn't decided to go around advertising that you were evading a block it is likely nobody would have noticed, but for whatever reason that is what you did. When your original account was blocked, that did not mean you were &quot;demoted&quot; as you seem to think. We only have two kinds of users: users who are blocked and users who are not. There is no in-between level where you are not allowed to use an account but it is ok to just log out and keep editing. Again, if you would like that situation to change you are free to appeal, but if you continue to evade the block instead that will actually diminish the chances of the situation changing. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 20:43, 20 April 2013 (UTC)''
::I only did that in order for someone to look at my previous appeals at DontBitetheNewcomer. In that appeal, I asked all further accounts I had at the time to be deleted along with that one, in order for this one (which is now blocked) to be an account where I wouldn't have to deal with being blocked. So, if someone could delete all previous accounts I had, could this be a legitimate account, or would I just be blocked indefinitely for it? If all previous accounts get deleted, I don't see how I could be using this site to sockpuppet or whatever. If you have the power to do that..... 
And don't read my earlier posts, that's my business and has no relevance whatever to this! That was when I wasn't blocked and was open to editing!!! And I didn't log out, I got banned for something I didn't comprehend in the first place! Where else would I have edited? And I continue to say that I've never harmed the site anyways, so isn't it OK to make helpful contributions and keep editing?!
Finally, I'd say there are no chances of this changing, because whenever I appeal or anything the answer is always &quot;NO. you're only lecturing us and trying to change our opinions.&quot; if I get shot down whenever I make an appeal, how can I change this at all? If I hadn't made the account yesterday, everything would be fine! How can making an account change all that in like a day?!



I'm sorry for all of that..... I got really angry and I kind of understand this now.
Upon further research, you have a policy of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Beeblebrox/fuck_off
fine. you're telling me to fuck off because &quot;I deserve it.&quot;
Well, I also found out the ban's for two weeks. Thank you, I thought I was banned off of WIkipedia for the remainder of forever on this IP, which I couldn't understand why. So, I'm done. I'll wait out this two weeks and then continue on my IP. 
You don't need to do anything I mentioned before. I won't make another account, I learned that, and I'll stop bothering you.
Sorry.....

Ok, so....

'':*I never told you to fuck off and your comments would seem to indicate that, just like everything I have said here, you are deliberately ignoring the key points in that essay and making up a meaning that you want it to have
:*You also seem to be a bit unstable and easy to anger, and to have entire conversations with yourself. This, along with the way you ignore or do not understand the points in our previous discussion  suggests that you are probably not well suited  editing in a collaborative environment such as this.
:*And you have announced your intent to ignore everything I have explained to you and evade the block again at the earliest opportunity.
*For all of those reasons, I am restarting and extending your block and revoking your ability to edit this talk page. You may use the [[WP:UTRS]] system or contact [[WP:BASC]] by email if you wish to appeal further. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 21:30, 20 April 2013 (UTC)''

==Wow!==
Wow! I can edit again! Cool!
I'm seriously jumping up and down right now!!!
And btw, I'm not unstable/easy to anger at all, if you knew me in real life. But then again, you don't. Eh.
And you'd also know that I'm a kid. Well, an early teen, but whatever. 
Still, I'm really excited! I'm quivering literally with joy :D
