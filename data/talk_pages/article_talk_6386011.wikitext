==NPOV and strange accounts of firing==
&quot;There he discovered the deep connection between medicine and politics firsthand&quot; seems a little suspect. Also, was there no sources of the 2002 incident besides the glowing testimonial on his party's website? If you Google search the string '''&quot;Alberta Association of Medical Health Officers&quot; -swann''' you get precisely 0 hits. Is the Association related to the Society? If you Google search '''&quot;Alberta Society of Health Officers&quot; -swann''' you also get 0 hits. Is there some reference to either organization before or after he was apparently involved in it?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.148.225.118|68.148.225.118]] ([[User talk:68.148.225.118|talk]]) 06:29, 2 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
