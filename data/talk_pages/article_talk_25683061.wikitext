== You Are Fast. ==

The speed and skill with which you flit through Wikipedia correcting wayward graffiti is astounding.  My meager efforts to make humorous jabs at a female friend remain no match for your precision and dedication. Alas, I must turn to other less nerdy methods of making my female companion laugh, therefore drawing her farther into my trap of &quot;seduction&quot;.  I bow to you, oh wayward wanderer of the web, and look forward to matching wits with you in the future. And by the way, she really is good at recapturing lost bovines. And DID score that badly on a&quot;Dirty Mind Test&quot;. Obviously a keeper no? I thought so too. I'm gonna go watch some random Youtube video now, cause its business time. Till we meet again, goodbye.

:The bit that you added may very well be correct, so in that sense there is nothing wrong with the post. I certainly didn't mean to step on your toes with my quick removal and warning. But this is an encyclopedia; we say what previously published (reliable) sources say. That's it and nothing more. Because of its open access though, Wikipedia can be a place for folks like yourself to get up on a soap box and yell something out. This just isn't the place to make yourself heard. Thanks for jumping in here, and I'd love to see you stick around and write some criticism (based on notable and reliable sources, of course) of that LIGO project.

So, as long as I site a source where someone else says the same thing, then it's legit?  Since when does something being published establish it's legitimacy?  And who determines reliable?  Some people think CNN is reliable and others don't.  Look at the &quot;reliability&quot; of current cosmology...not doing so hot these days.  I understand your beef with my comments, which is fine, but the inverse is never true.

I see that you removed the listing of EvDO equipment manufacturers. I believe that this information is useful, in that if I was researching and wanted more information about EvDO, I might visit those manufacturers sites.

== McDonalds warning ==

Maybe you need to be slowing down on the &quot;last warnings&quot; there.  If you think someones gonna get blocked for what was on the McDonalds page, you need to take a deep breath.

At its worst it was adding unsourced information.  Which begs the question of wether or not you actually checked to see if the information was verifiable or not before sicking twinkle on it.  

Perhaps a review of WP:AGF and WP:BITE would do you some good?  Perhaps pointing out to the user that information needs to be verified would be better than leaving final warnings you can't enforce.

:No. I don't think WP:BITE applies here. There are too many dumb people making unconstructive edits, vandalism, and &quot;hey look at me&quot; stuff. Also, there are the folks that don't do formatting and syntax correctly, possibly because English is not their first language. Those folks should be working on Wikipedia in the language that they know best. Not this one. Finally, one warning is sufficient. I do not believe that a whole string of warnings (our current method includes four) is necessary to effectively communicate to an individual to stop what unconstructive and ridiculous edits that they're making. I think that most of them are really not that stupid and that they understand what they are doing is malicious. So no, I will not take your advice. Goodbye.

Take a deep breath... I am not itching to ban anyone. Nor am I looking to be an admin. That appears to be too much work. 

My goal here at Wikipedia is that I am trying to build this encyclopedia, but these [[douchebag]]s are taking up seventy five percent of the time that I actually work on it. I'm tired of spending so much time on maintenance. I don't know what your goal is, but mine is one that is to actually get some work done. See ya. [[User:E_dog95|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;''E_dog95'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:E_dog95|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;''   Hi '''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:45, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

Right now my goal is to not be lumped together with a group labeled 'douchebag'.  Instantly templating someone for not sourcing their edits invites distruption (see:Feeding the Trolls).  Not everyone (and especially not IPs) know how to source things properly but might want to know how.  Templating borderline cases with last warnings and labeling them as vandals will either drive away potentially good editors, or worse turn them into real vandals.  Then you will never get any work done.  Read up on the history of USER:Betacommand and you'll get an idea of what I am talking about.  He did great work against vandals and copywrite violators, but was rewarded with near constant harassment IN PART because his attitude made enemies out of people who were just trying to help.  If you can't be bothered to even TRY to show someone how to source an edit before putting them into the douchebag pile, then maybe you should put twinkle down and, as you say, 'actually get some work done'.[[Special:Contributions/198.161.173.180|198.161.173.180]] ([[User talk:198.161.173.180|talk]]) 20:49, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

==Re: Pandora (disambiguation)==
Odd though this may sound, I didn't realize putting a URL into a disambiguation page was out of bounds. However, after reading up on [[WP:Spam]], I see your point. I am sort of a casual Wikipedian, and had fallen into the habit of assuming the idea here is simply to lead people to any little bit of information they may be seeking, &quot;by any means necessary,&quot; as it were--I see now that the more appropriate focus is on &quot;building the encyclopedia.&quot; Basically, I was starting to confuse Wikipedia with Google. I had begun looking at disambiguation pages as guides to almost any possible meaning of a term, as opposed to guides to any possible Wikipedia article relating to a term. 

I realize the above may sound unaccountably moronic, but let's remember to assume good faith--I initially found your use of the term &quot;spam&quot; perplexing, because the notion that I, AdRock, have a goal of promoting the business of a small British publishing house called Pandora Books is absurd--I merely wanted to know what the &quot;Pandora&quot; I ran across in a magazine article today was referring to specifically, and I didn't find it here on Wikipedia, which is usually my first port of call in such matters; my second port of call is Google (see above), and when I found Pandora Books there, I thought I would help out anybody else in the same situation by putting the external link on the Wikipedia disambiguation page for &quot;Pandora&quot;. I see now that that was entirely wrongheaded; and frankly, I've done exactly the same thing on other disambiguation pages, probably two or three times. On one occasion, I later saw my edit reverted with no explanation, and I didn't understand why. Your brief message gave me a clue, although it was rather brusque and uninformative--again, as though I'm some kind of shill for Pandora Books--the idea! Based on my scan of the WP:Spam page, a quicker (for you) and more helpful (for me) message might have been {{tls|uw-spam1}}.

== Civility ==

While [[WP:BITE]] is a guideline, not a policy, I strongly urge you to abide by it as it's a very good idea and repeatedly biting newcomers may lead to an RFC.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AToddst1&amp;diff=267334357&amp;oldid=265877510 This edit], however violates a Wikipedia policy, [[WP:Civil]].  It is not OK to refer to other editors as &quot;losers&quot;, whether they are vandalizing or not. Comment on content, not on the contributor.  Repeated transgressions of [[WP:Civil]] will get you blocked.  [[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk: Toddst1|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:23, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

== Hairshirt environmentalism ==

I suppose I should have worked on this page in my sandbox first, but as it was, the only Wikipedia guideline that it missed was that it didn't have references.  There are myriad pages on Wikipedia without references.  Hopefully the page is in better shape now.  I was taken slightly off guard by having this called &quot;Vandalism&quot;.  That's pretty extreme.

I hope that you are as speedy with removing the hoax tag as you were with applying it.

:The [[DJ Doran]] page just contained the words &quot;[[Doran Chambers]]&quot;, and was obviously an attempt at a redirect. I've moved the &quot;Doran Chambers&quot; page to [[User:Dawnseeker2000/Doran Chambers]] so you can work on it. However, be aware that albums of artists without Wikipedia articles can qualify for speedy deletion at any time per [[WP:CSD#A9|speedy deletion criterion A9]]. If you want to avoid that, move them both to your userspace or add more info to the articles to show why the albums are important.

Dawnseeker2000, you are incorrect in reverting my change of the default Krb5 max clock skew.

The correct default skew is 5 minutes, not 10.  See MIT's implementation for reference.  This is true of MSFT and IBM impls also.

Hello there! As an editor who has posted a comment in one of the recent Peer Reviews, GANs or FACs of [[International Space Station]], or who has contributed to the article recently, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind commenting in the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/International Space Station/archive4|current Featured Article Candidacy]] with any suggestions you have for article improvements (and [[WP:BOLD|being bold]] and making those changes), whether or not you feel any issues you have previously raised have been dealt with, and, ultimately, if you believe the article meets the Featured Article guidelines. This is the fourth FAC for this article, and it'd be great to have it pass. Many thanks in advance, [[User:Colds7ream|Colds7ream]] ([[User talk:Colds7ream|talk]]) 16:45, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

== Warning vandals ==

Hello.  It was recently brought to my attention the way you used vandalism warning messages on [[User talk:Miley234350]].  You gave three escalating warnings simultaneously when the user hadn't edited between them.  The page that contains the warning templates and how to use them, [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace]], says &quot;You should check that the user has made harmful edits since their last warning – the user must be given a chance to see and react to each warning given.&quot;  Also, [[User:Lear's Fool|Lear's Fool]] had already given a warning for the edit to [[Stuff]], and you gave a repeat warning for the same edit unnecessarily.  The final warning you gave was for edits to [[Y]], and from the user's [[Special:Contributions/Miley234350|contributions]] you can see that those edits were made in September and November of 2008, more than a year ago, so that additional warning was not relevant.  And because the user talk page was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;page=User_talk%3AMiley234350 deleted] on December 10, 2009, there may have already been a warning or two for those edits, making your final warning possibly a repeat too.  The reason warning should be given the way I have described is so that the user can be properly reported to [[Wikipedia:Guide to administrator intervention against vandalism]] if more vandalism occurs.  Obvious and persistent vandals can be reported there and then blocked if they have received appropriate and sufficient warnings for current vandalism.  As it stands now, if Miley234350 continued to vandalize Wikipedia today, I would not feel the warnings were appropriate and sufficient to add a report to AIV, and I don't believe an administrator would block the user if a report was added, despite what your final warning says on Miley234350's talk page.

Your reversions of vandalism have been very good, and I am not trying to discourage you from continuing.  In the future, please give one vandalism warning at a time, for a recent vandalism edit if it was made after the last warning, if one exists.  This will give good-faith editors a chance to learn how to make constructive contributions and ensure that bad-faith vandals have the proper warnings for an administrator to block them, if that becomes necessary.  Please let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks!  --[[User:Mysdaao|Mysdaao]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mysdaao|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:01, 20 December 2009 (UTC)

:Yes I did notice that I warned the user for the Stuff edit when the warning already existed. I hdan't noticed until I posted it, but decided not to remove it. I frequently see vandals work way faster than vandal fighters and admins can and this is why I was too heavy handed there. I have been admonished for dealing with vandals before. It bothers me. But I have taken your words seriously and will be watching what i do.

== D-STAR page changes ==

There was a reference in some of the changes you'd made asking the question Who is Matt Yellen. This was asked as you deleted the section within the history that referenced who Matt Yellen was. Matt Yellen KB7TSE and later K7DN was an Icom employee, and was put in charge of Icom's D-STAR development for the US. Later references indicated that not only was he in charge of development, he attended many Hamfests to include Dayton, and played a large marketing role for Icom and D-STAR. In other words, if there was one person in all of Icom America who knew D-STAR, was authorized by the company to talk about it, it was he. He trained many of the Icom support people you now might correspond with when it comes to D-STAR. He flew to Texas to help the K5TIT team deploy the first Gateway, which is now the primary Trust Server for the World.

Finally, he used the Icom forums as a major information dissemination tool. Much of the historical information now on the Wikipedia page that now has no reference as to it's source, was originally sourced from the Icom Forums, and from the statements made by Matt Yellen. Matt Yellen and his statements as made in the Icom forums appear to be the most accurate source of real D-STAR information I could find. He was the horse's mouth ;-)

Matt no longer works for Icom, and was not replaced. Now this is totally opinion, but I think it shows. Matt was the single connection we as a community had into Icom that could give us good, accurate and current D-STAR information, in part because he was the one that did the work that created the information, and developed the press releases.

I'm by no means an Wikipedia expert. The D-STAR page was my first attempt to contribute, and I'm sure it showed. Heck, I'm struggling to write this! ...but one thing's for sure, everyone knows Wikipedia is user created. As such, it has to be treated as the shaky source of information it can be. If I can't find specific reference to information on any Wikipedia page, I must assume it's not true, rumor, etc... How do you suggest we resolve it on this particular page? Did I do something wrong in my referencing?

Thanks

[[User:KF7CEG|KF7CEG]] ([[User talk:KF7CEG|talk]]) 20:08, 23 December 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for your response. This was my attempt at a first contribution. I now have a much better idea how Wikipedia works, and realize it's not my bag.

==Tunguska Event changes==

Sorry for the confusion, i should have said something in the discussion.  As i was reading over the article, i saw two bits of information that seemed to contradict each other.  It says earlier in the article that the blast most likely was the equivalent of 10–15 megatons of TNT.  This piece of information is cited.  However, later, it says that this impact would be a 5.0 on the Richter scale.  This piece of information is not cited.  When looking on the richter scale article, it rates an explosion with a yield of 16.2 Megatons of TNT at a 6.7 on the richter scale.  Therefore, i inserted a magnitude more fitting with the cited information.  Either the magnitude should stay 6.6 or 6.7, or the sentence should be deleted due to the fact that it's not cited.  Either way, what i did was not vandalism, it was fixing incorrect information.  Again, sorry for any confusion.

Whoops, sorry, my mistake.  It turns out that it was cited further down in the article.  Still contradictory, but i don't want to be the one to fix it.
