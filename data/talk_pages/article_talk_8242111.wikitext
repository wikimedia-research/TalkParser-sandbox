==Disambiguation link notification for April 27==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Shakhriyar Mamedyarov]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[FIDE Grand Prix]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Shakhriyar_Mamedyarov|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Shakhriyar_Mamedyarov|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

== Good article reassessment. ==

Hi there. I noticed that you recently nominated [[Azerbaijan Premier League]] and [[Neftchi Baku PFC]] for [[WP:GAR|Good article reassessment]]. As this is something that it used for ''current'' good articles, and neither of those are listed as GA's at the moment, I believe that you wanted to nominate it for [[WP:GAN|Good article nomination]]? If that is correct, you should remove the GAR-template at the talkpages and follow [[WP:GAN/I]] for instructions on how to nominate these articles for GAN.

&lt;small&gt;''Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Procedures#Enforcement|here]]. According to the procedures, a &quot;clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors&quot; is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. &lt;p&gt;To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see [[WP:UNINVOLVED]]).''&lt;/small&gt;

===Statement by NovaSkola===

Hello, I've been user in Wikipedia long time ago, made over 20,000 contributions and never been given topic ban until few days ago, someone violated my IP and wrote some nonsense and as a result I've been topic banned for editing Azerbaijan-Armenia related articles, even though it wasn't completely my fault.

I've demand to unblock me on charges of that 99% of my edits been trouble free, I've understand that in future I've take responsibility from my account as well as I will follow Wikipedia's guideline to make better community. Furthermore, 6 month ban for this looks extremely harsh.

===Statement by Sandstein===

===Statement by (involved editor 1)===
Your topic ban is solely due to your edit-warring. Your disruption and as to what you were exactly edit-warring over was not even considered in the WP:AE process. This would mean that you received a six month topic ban in the least and escaped with anything more than that.

P.S. You could've warned us earlier about your IP address problems (if that were the actual case that is). Besides, your contributions and edits seem to be consistent and similar for the past month in the least.

== Guba Article ==

How is it vandalism when i am posting the Armenian side of the event? You claim the info i posted is one sided, have you read the article? There is no evidence in the article which proves Armenians were responsible and yet it claims Armenians were responsible. Like i stated in the summary of my revision the Armenian Genocide has a denial section because some people dont believe it took place so this article should have its own denial section as most people dont believe it happened. So you deleting it because you dont like it is an act of vandalism so i am giving you a warning here, if you keep deleting it i will report you.

; [[WP:ESC|Project News]]
* When creating new articles about a performer or song, please remember to [[WP:SOURCES|add sources]] either from Eurovision.tv, ESCToday or other [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].  If you're not sure a source is reliable enough, then ask the project for an opinion.
* Data tables of winners for [[OGAE]] and [[Marcel Bezençon Awards]] have been mass added under the radar across a variety of Eurovision articles without any [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]], which there should be for something like that. These sections have been badly formatted with various problems including inappropriate links in the section headings (discouraged in [[MOS:HEAD]]), no written explanation on what these tables mean, and most importantly, no [[WP:SOURCES|sources]].
* Remember to only add content to articles that is relevant to the article's main subject.  Anything not in relation to the article may be questioned and/or subject to redirection to an article that would benefit it's inclusion.  Again if in doubt, ask on the article or project talk pages for an opinion - communication is an important tool.
* On the subject of communication, please make use of the article talk pages.  They are a vital tool in conducting consensus talks of additions of proposed new sections and/or removal of unnecessary section.  If you don't use these pages to put across your views, then you only have yourself to blame if actions are taken that you disagree with and you end up wandering into [[WP:WAR|edit warring]] territory.
* The 2012 season of Eurovision has drawn to a close, and we now start preparations for the 2013 edition.  While things will be slow to start of with, now is the ideal opportunity to do a [[WP:CLEAN|clean-up]] exercise across articles relating to the project.  There's over 4,500 articles associated with the project. If you happen to see a Eurovision related article without the {{tl|EurovisionNotice}} template on the article's talk page, please add it. You can also read [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment]] if you would like to help assess or reassess articles in our project if you see that they have outgrown their current assessment. There is currently one unassessed article.
* '''''And finally...''''' a massive thank you to all members of the project for your constant hard work on collaborating and contributing to [[WP:ESC|Eurovision]] related articles.  Keep up the good work team!

[[User:MauriManya]] is relentlessly replacing in the infobox of the [[Azerbaijan]] article, the map &quot;Azerbaijan (orthographic projection).svg&quot; which shows Azerbaijan with its de-jure borders and is replacing it with the map &quot;Azerbaijan with Nagorno Karabakh and region.svg&quot; which shows Nagorno-Karabakh as a legitimate entity.

==Edit war on [[Khojaly Massacre ]]==
Hello. You appear to be involved in an [[WP:EW|edit war]] on [[Khojaly Massacre ]].

While [[WP:3RR|the three-revert rule]] is hard and fast, please be aware that you can be blocked for edit warring without making 3 reverts to an article in 24 hours. You are not entitled to 3 reverts and edit wars may be slow-moving, spanning weeks or months.  Edit wars are not limited to 24 hours.

If you are unclear how to resolve a content dispute, please see [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]].  You are expected to cooperatively engage other editors on talk pages rather than reverting their edits.  Note that posting your thoughts on the talk page alone is not a license to continue reverting. You must reach consensus.  

If you feel your edits might qualify as one of [[WP:3RRNO|the small list of exceptions]], please apply them with caution and ensure that anyone looking at your edits will come to the same conclusion.  If you are uncertain, seek clarification before continuing.  Quite a few editors have found themselves blocked for misunderstanding and/or misapplying these exceptions.  Often times, requesting [[WP:RFPP|page protection]] or [[WP:SPI|a sockppuppet investigation]] is a much better course of action.

''Continued edit warring on [[Khojaly Massacre ]] or any other article may cause you to be blocked without further notice.'' [[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk: Toddst1|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:45, 31 December 2012 (UTC)
==Notice of AA2==
You are now notified of the discretionary sanctions provisions of the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan 2|''Armenia-Azerbaijan 2'' (AA) arbitration case]]:

{{quotation|[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] The [[WP:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]] has permitted [[WP:Administrators|administrators]] to impose, at their own discretion, [[Wikipedia:General sanctions|sanctions]] on any editor working on pages broadly related to [[Armenia]]-[[Azerbaijan]] and related conflicts if the editor repeatedly or seriously fails to adhere to the [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|purpose of Wikipedia]], any expected [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|standards of behavior]], or any [[Wikipedia:List of policies|normal editorial process]]. If you engage in further inappropriate behavior in this area, you may be placed under sanctions including blocks, a revert limitation or an article ban. The committee's full decision can be read at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan 2#Final decision]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-sanctions - {{{topic|{{{t}}}}}} --&gt;
}}

In future, please take care to edit constructively on contested topic areas. When in disagreement with an editor over an aspect of article content, take the dispute to the talk page or to [[WP:dispute resolution|dispute resolution]]; do ''not'' use the revert function to repeatedly force through your preferred version of the page.

== You are now a Reviewer ==

[[File:Redaktor Wikipedia 600px.png|right|130px]]
Hello. Your account has been granted the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;reviewer&lt;tt&gt;&quot; userright, allowing you to [[WP:Reviewing|review other users' edits]] on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, will be commencing a [[WP:Pending changes|two-month trial]] at approximately 23:00, 2010 June 15 (UTC).

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not [[wp:autoconfirmed|autoconfirmed]] to articles placed under flagged protection. Flagged protection is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. 

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or [[WP:BLP|BLP violations]], and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see [[Wikipedia:Reviewing process]]). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found [[WP:Pending changes|here]].

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time. &lt;!-- Template:Reviewer-notice --&gt; [[User:Courcelles|Courcelles]] ([[User talk:Courcelles|talk]]) 23:50, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

==Issue==
You are inviting feedback to your articles. Well, an issue is that you delete talk page items. The convention is that you keep talk page items on your page for a while, and then you archive them. How would I know whether somebody else has already commented on the issue before? I don't want to have to go through your talk page history to find out.

What I wanted to let you know about is that your DYK nomination has been rejected. I suggest you read up on the [[WP:WIADYK|DYK rules]].

== Notification: changes to &quot;Mark my edits as minor by default&quot; preference ==

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled &quot;Mark all edits minor by default&quot;, which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse ([[Help_talk:Minor_edit#Should_we_remove_the_Preference_setting_to_.22Mark_all_edits_minor_by_default.22_.3F|consensus discussion]], guidelines for use at [[WP:MINOR]]). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and all users will still be able to manually mark their edits as being minor in the usual way. 

For well-established users such as yourself there is '''[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_default_asked_to_be_removed_in_bugzilla:24313|a workaround available]]''' involving custom JavaScript. If you have any problems, feel free to drop me a note.

Please refrain from introducing inappropriate pages, such as [[:MTV Azerbaijan]], to Wikipedia. Doing so is not in accordance with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]]. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted.

Hi NovaSkola. If you make [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azerbaijani_Armed_Forces&amp;diff=438428680&amp;oldid=438428442 this] kind of edit again, which is drawn from an independent third party source, and as far as my professional credentials can assess, represents an accurate view of the military balance in the region, without discussion, you will be blocked without further warning. Regards [[User:Buckshot06|Buckshot06]] [[User_talk:Buckshot06|(talk)]] 23:51, 8 July 2011 (UTC)
:Please read the actual reference, which is linked in the footnotes. Charles Blandy, a British military analyst employed at the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]], is making some professional judgements based on what he reads from the Russian-language press and other sources. The general contention is also backed up by the linked [[International Crisis Group]] report, and finally and most importantly, it makes sense to me personally. The general situation has parallels with the [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]] experience and Israel; the Armenians feel they are isolated and outgunned by the military forces of Turkey and Azerbaijan, so they have a very high motivation to improve the functioning of their armed forces. According to all the data I have read, Azerbaijan's position is different, and the factors which impede the effectiveness of many post-Soviet armed forces are impeding the effectiveness of the ground forces. To be honest, I'm not so sure about the Air and Air Defence Forces; there is less data.

Hello,

Please note that there have been some changes to operations surrounding Eurovision articles, these being that:

* Template names have now been standardised, for example [[Template:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest]] and [[Template:Countries in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] have both been moved in order to be consistent. If you are planning to create a new template, please keep the standardised titles in mind.
* {{tlx|WikiProject Eurovision}} now accepts importance ratings as well as quality ratings, and the project now has a formal [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Eurovision/Assessment|assessment department]] which gives details on how to assess articles, and provides a place for contributors to request re-assessment. Feel free to add the {{tlx|WikiProject Eurovision}} template to the talk page of any new Eurovision articles you create.
* The Eurovision Song Contest now has its own [[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]] template at {{tlx|Eurovision-stub}}. Please only use this on Eurovision Song Contest stubs, with {{tlx|Music-stub}} and {{tlx|Dance-stub}} being the appropriate template for other Eruovision contests.

If you have any questions, please ask at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Eurovision]].

{{unblock reviewed | 1=I've been blocked by user [[User:Sandstein]] based on facts that I violated my ban at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sandstein&amp;oldid=595043489#Section_blanking_by_user_Zimmarod for 2 months. However, I am appealing to get unblocked on facts that... 1. I've never been told by Sandstein, that discussion of this issue in talk page leads to the ban. 2. Instead of warning me about this, he straightly banned me and wrote &quot;I'll block you in enforcement of the ban as soon as I get around to it.&quot; like he seeking kind of personal revenge 3. I've been trouble free all of these years until Sandstein under guidance of armenians users started to ban me. I do agree, I violated sometimes policies, but Sandstein instead of using explanation and warnings, he straightly banned me, which for me looks like administrator's power abuse. 4. Furthermore, his blocks duration been far long compared to others users. I hope at least my ban period will be reduced because it doesn't seem fair after all these contributions that you can check done to wikipedia articles. I've contributed to over 5,000 wikipedia articles, which all been trouble free so I hope this dispute resolves in good. | decline = (1) On a previous occasion when you tried to get round your ban by asking on a talk page for someone else to make an edit for you, you were told ''&quot;You sent me some changes you proposed for the article Azerbaijan. Unfortunately I can't take action on this. Per [[WP:PROXYING]] you can't have another editor make changes to an article you are banned from.&quot;'' The same issue has also been mentioned in a case about you at [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement]], and ''you took part in that discussion.'' It is therefore absurd to claim that you had not been told that posting to a talk page, requesting that another editor make an edit on your behalf, was contrary to your ban. (2) Of course you weren't warned on this occasion before being blocked, because you have already had ''far more than enough'' warnings on previous occasions. You don't need a new warning about the same thing every time you do it. (3) You have been &quot;trouble free all of these years&quot;? And yet you have a topic ban, and had already been blocked four times, three of those being for the same offence as this time (violation of your topic ban), the latest of those bans being less than four months ago? (4) A 59-day block for an editor who has repeatedly violated a topic ban, and whose last block was for 59 days, is minimal. Personally, I would have blocked you for much longer, as 59 days has been proved to be insufficient to deter you, and I doubt that many admins would have given you less.

You are welcome to [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|make useful contributions]] once the block expires.&amp;nbsp;If you believe this block is unjustified, please read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks#Arbitration enforcement blocks|guide to appealing arbitration enforcement blocks]] and then appeal your block using the instructions there.  &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Reminder to administrators:''' In March 2010, ArbCom adopted a [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Procedures#Reversal of enforcement actions|procedure prohibiting administrators]] &quot;from reversing or overturning (explicitly or in substance) any action taken by another administrator pursuant to the terms of an active arbitration remedy, and explicitly noted as being taken to enforce said remedy, except: (a) with the written authorization of the Committee, or (b) following a clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors at a community discussion noticeboard (such as WP:AN or WP:ANI). If consensus in such discussions is hard to judge or unclear, the parties should submit a request for clarification on the proper page.&quot; Administrators who reverse an arbitration enforcement block, such as this one, without clear authorisation will be summarily desysopped.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-aeblock --&gt; Per [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=578559424&amp;oldid=578498326 the discussion here].

In addition to the block, your topic ban from everything concerning Armenia and Azerbaijan has been made indefinite, but with a sports exemption. Any appeal of your block would be through [[WP:AEBLOCK]]. In my opinion you could consider appealing the topic ban in six months [[WP:AE]] after at least six months.

Could all Azeri users check and prevent the incorrect name change of the article [[Ermenikend]] into the incorrect name of  &quot;Armenikend&quot;. 

These users constantly change the correct article name of Ermenikend into the incorrect name of &quot;Armenikend&quot;. 

This was done unilaterally without any discussion and whithout any (widespread) agreement whatsoever.
