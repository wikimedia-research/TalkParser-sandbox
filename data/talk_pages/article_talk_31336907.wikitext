==Education==
He 'received his education in the United Kingdom' but he was in Libya until he was 25 or 26. Could this be clarified? Does it mean he attended university in the UK after he came, or was he allowed to leave before his father?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.156.219.217|81.156.219.217]] ([[User talk:81.156.219.217|talk]]) 12:10, 22 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Anti-Gaddafists rally in London==
Libyan opposition leaders at their first gathering in exile vow to oust Gaddafi, reports May Youssef in London 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They say there is no other choice but ousting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. They say the Libyan constitution -- drafted in 1951 and one of the most progressive in the Arab world -- must be restored after 35 years in limbo. They blame the West for normalising ties with the Gaddafi regime, despite numerous violations of basic human rights and the execution of hundreds of opposition figures over the past three decades.

More than 200 leading opponents to Gaddafi, moved by winds of reforms blowing over many parts of the Middle East -- especially Egypt, Libya's neighbour -- met for the first time at the weekend to launch their united &quot;national accord&quot; call for regime change in the North African country which they say has been kidnapped and ruled with an iron fist. In their final declaration, opposition leaders vowed to try Gaddafi and other regime officials suspected of human rights crimes.

The location of the two-day conference wasn't revealed until the early hours of Saturday for fear that Libyan intelligence may disrupt the meeting or harm its attendants. 

Despite all precautions, around 15 Libyan students marched on the second day of the conference carrying green flags and chanting pro-Gaddafi slogans inside the hotel where the gathering was convened, attempting to disrupt the meeting. The Libyan Embassy allegedly threatened to cut the scholarships of Libyan students who refused to participate in the pro-Gaddafi demonstration. Some 40 British police officers and hotel security guards dispersed the students. 

On Monday two separate demonstrations were planned in front of the old and the new embassies of Libya in London to voice solidarity with the Libyan regime.

Meanwhile, the opposition gathering itself -- the first of a once fragmented movement established in European and Arab countries since the 1980s -- failed to formulate effective strategies for realising its objectives. Some critics dismissed it as going no further than mere sloganeering. This may be true, but certainly the conference itself marks a new beginning for the Libyan opposition.

Shifting to peaceful means over the use of force is something new; above all to the National Front for Salvation of Libya (NFSL), which carried out several coup and assassination attempts inside Libya since Gaddafi took power. The NFSL once formed an army on the Libyan-Chad borders, prompting Gaddafi to threaten the use of chemical weapons if they dared attack. One of the best-publicised assassination attempts took place in the late-1980s when members of the NFSL stormed Bab Al-Aziziya camp where Gaddafi was visiting. The attempt failed and many Libyan fedayeen were executed.

The London gathering also brought together old foes, such as the National Movement -- an umbrella group of pan-Arabists, Nasserites and Baathists -- which was once anti-monarchy, and Prince Mohamed Al-Senoussi, grandson of the ousted Libyan King Idris Al-Senoussi. Gaddafi, after the 1969 coup that got rid of the monarchy, launched a bloody campaign against Nasserites, including Mahmoud Abdel-Wanis, who called upon Gaddafi to return to military camp and leave Libya's leadership to civilian rule. The Nasserites were enemies of the monarchy, but now remember with nostalgia the golden times of Al-Senoussi, under which Libya witnessed a renaissance.

&quot;With some negative aspects [under monarchy], it was the real beginning of democratic life in Libya, and for 18 years. Gaddafi kidnapped the country after the coup and took us into 35 years of darkness,&quot; said Nouri El-Khakhya, a leading member of the opposition and cousin of former Libyan foreign minister Mansour El-Khakhya who disappeared in 1993 while attending a human rights conference in Egypt. It is said that Mansour El-Khakhya was kidnapped and handed to the Libyan authorities, whereupon he was murdered.

The heir of the throne -- as many people called him at this weekend's gathering -- Prince Mohamed Al-Senoussi, said that the return of monarchy to Libya is not a priority, but &quot;the United Nations must interfere and restore the constitution, to hold free elections and let the people decide what system they prefer.&quot;

The only major group that stayed away from the gathering was the Muslim Brotherhood which, in a statement issued Sunday, criticised the conference for listing preconditions for participation, including &quot;ousting Gaddafi&quot;, which the group rejects. The Brotherhood insisted that the chance remained that the regime will change itself; that there are advocates of reform inside the regime who can push for change without the need to oust Gaddafi. The Brotherhood, with some 100 political prisoners in Libyan jails, has received assurances from Seif Islam Gaddafi, said to be in the process of being groomed to succeed his father, to free Islamist detainees. 

Other opponents, such as Ashur Shames, author of the anti-Gaddafi website, Akhbar- Libya (Libya news), criticised the rhetoric of the conference. &quot;How are they going to remove the regime? By force, or by threatening to use force?&quot; he asked. Shames, who participated in early preparations but boycotted the meeting itself, believes, like the Brotherhood, that it is not too late to reform the regime through dialogue.

Three participants came from Libya using forged passports and nicknames.

On the last day of the conference, while opposition figures greeted each other with hugs and tears, the conference website received many messages of support from Libyan citizens. &quot;The people are angry, but someone must start the fire... I am with you,&quot; one Libyan citizen wrote in an anonymous message.[[User:Bnguyen|Bnguyen]] 07:02, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

==Move to a shorter title==
It's better to have a shorter title and mention the full name in the first paragraph. [[User:Jahangard|Jahangard]] 06:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

==Constitutional prince==
he isn't considered only by Libyan royalists to be the legitimate heir to Crown of Libya, but he is considered so by a large segment of Libyan people.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.205.232.27|82.205.232.27]] ([[User talk:82.205.232.27|talk]]) 06:27, 25 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I have removed the link to the International Commission on Nobility and royalty  http//www.nobility-royalty.com as this so called fake organization is not recognized by any official bodies, it is a private website run by a man from America who was defrauded out of money by a famous fake title seller and so it was designed to go on the attack of fake title sellers, which is of course a right and just course, but this site does not hold, bear or enjoy any form of official recognition of status whatsoever, just another fake so called semi official website run by private persons, the adding of any links to this site without due process is of course quite bogus!
==Exile==
There is a bit of I information that keeps getting removed about his possible return from exile. The article in question states he returns spells his name different which is usually common with Libyan peoples names In news media for example how Gaddafi is usually spelt different. If anyone can comment about this so we can clear this up so we don't keep removing and adding back the information.

:I don't think the ''EL SENUSSI: The Libyan Tea Party'' article is by the Crown Prince. Hilal is not one of his names, and secondly he only went into exile in 1988 while the author of the article says that he had been in exile for 41 years. - [[User:DWC LR|dwc lr]] ([[User talk:DWC LR|talk]]) 13:35, 24 March 2011 (UTC)
::After rereading the article I agree it isnt him either. I spead read through it and didnt read closely. It is most likly another member of the royal family that returned.
*Also I want to bring up that we should rename the article to Muhammad al-Senussi. Most news articles call him al-Senussi not as-Senussi. [[User:Spongie555|Spongie555]] ([[User talk:Spongie555|talk]]) 05:29, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
**Yeah I think it should be moved from &quot;as-&quot;. His official website uses [http://mohammedelsenussi.org/home.html Mohammed el-Senussi]. - [[User:DWC LR|dwc lr]] ([[User talk:DWC LR|talk]]) 12:46, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
***The article should be moved to al-Senussi or el-Senussi because no where calls him as-Senussi. [[User:Spongie555|Spongie555]] ([[User talk:Spongie555|talk]]) 17:26, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

Is there anything wrong with giving a better transliteration of the name? El Senussi/Senoussi etc. are Italian spellings. But academic usage is Sanusi and al-Sanusi for members of the Sanusiyya Sufi order. It's more accurate and allows readers who are less well informed to see the link.

== Homosexuality? ==

I've read and heard that El-Senussi is a homosexual and has thus not been able to marry. Is this true? --[[Special:Contributions/61.8.222.178|61.8.222.178]] ([[User talk:61.8.222.178|talk]]) 04:56, 25 July 2011 (UTC)
