help what am I meant to do!

----
Today, I changed the article to note that the term &quot;May Day&quot; is not particularly accurate in regards to Maid Marian. The village festivals that she participated in are often called the May Games, and take place around May or June, often close to Pentecost. There are only a few instances recorded of such festivals occuring on May 1 proper. This has led to some confusion between &quot;May Day&quot; and &quot;May Games&quot;. David Wiles, author of the 1981 book, The Early Plays of Robin Hood corrects this fallacy (and also mentions the male cross-dressing Marian). Wiles's statements have been supported by Stephen Knight (in three books), Jeffrey Sigman and pretty much every modern Robin Hood scholar.

Apparently, however, people who have actually studied the Robin Hood legend for decades don't have as informed opinion as those who removed this correction based on some book not written by Robin Hood experts.

A supporting quotation from the current world expert on Robin Hood.

&quot;The play-games have a firm location in the calendar: they are in May, but not May Day; the Robin Hood play-games are not to be confused with the fertility symbolism of May Day and the maypole. Rather, Robin Hood's time is Whitsun, the &quot;White Sunday&quot; that celebrated Pentecost and the descent of the Holy Spirit. &quot;White Sunday&quot; was white not only in terms of holiness but also because then, as now, by mid- to late May the hedges and shrubs of rural England were densely white with the hawthorn flower, also known as May flower and whitethorn. Seeing the landscape change so quickly is still a striking, even moving, sight; the fertility linked to Robin Hood is not that of an agressively masculine maypole but that of the more generalized force of fertile nature.&quot;

== Questionable book reference ==

I just reverted vandalism on this page, and I also removed this entry:

*''The Forestwife''; [[1994]] novel by [[Theresa Tomlinson]]

Can anyone verify this? The [[Theresa Tomlinson]] page lists the novel as being published in 1993. If the character of Maid Marian appears in this book, please add it to the article again, verifying the year and modifying the Theresa Tomlinson article as needed.

==MARIAN IN THE 20TH CENTURY==

The article might mention that it has become a nearly universal custom nowadays in retellings of the story for the tale to end with the announcement of Robin's and Marian's forthcoming marriage - almost always in connection with King Richard's deus ex machina return from the Crusades to set everything right. Also, notice how many modern renditions have shown her as &quot;Lady Marian&quot; rather than &quot;Maid Marian.&quot; Almost all, I think.

:You would need a citation for that.  [[User:Goldfritha|Goldfritha]] 02:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

:Actually, in the recent [[BBC]]-version of [[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)|Robin Hood]], Marian is killed by [[Guy of Gisbourne]] in [[We Are Robin Hood!|the last episode of series 2]], when [[Richard I of England|king Richard]] was still in Palestine. --[[User:Oddeivind|Oddeivind]] ([[User talk:Oddeivind|talk]]) 09:19, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

== Requiem for a Dream ==

I've removed this line in the Movies section, as it's not really notable.  I'm sure there have been numerous occasions where Maid Marion gets mentioned once in a work of fiction.  [[User:Rojomoke|Rojomoke]] ([[User talk:Rojomoke|talk]]) 17:48, 20 November 2007 (UTC)
:*In the movie ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' one of the characters is named Marion. Right before she conducts sexual activities with someone he names her &quot;Maid Marion&quot;, and chuckles.
it's VERY notable, restore it!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.47.161.234|62.47.161.234]] ([[User talk:62.47.161.234|talk]]) 00:12, 5 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Removed Uncited Section ==
I removed this section which had an August 2007 cite request on it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In yet another incarnation, Marian is depicted as an albino, who is part of an enclave of outcasts consisting of 'freaks' that have been thrown out of the city by the Sherriff, and provide Robin with the first few Merry Men
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Name? ==

Marian or Marion? Someone tried changing from the former to the latter; I've just reverted, as the title is Marian (and I've a feeling that's correct). If you have proof one way or the other, please list below; if either is valid then the correct procedure is to mention the alternative spelling once at the top - something like:

 '''Maid Marian''' (or '''Maid Marion''' - 'Maid' being short for maiden, and sometimes referred to simply as Marion)

not to go through with find and replace. As the article is already here, the only way it's changing to Marion would be if Marian was wrong or very rare.
