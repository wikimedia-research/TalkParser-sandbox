== Replaceable fair use File:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg ==
[[File:Ambox warning.svg|32px|left]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg]]'''. I noticed that this file is being used under a claim of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|fair use]]. However, I think that the way it is being used fails the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|first non-free content criterion]]. This criterion states that files used under claims of fair use may have ''no free equivalent''; in other words, if the file could be adequately covered by a freely-licensed file or by text alone, then it may not be used on Wikipedia. If you believe this file is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:File:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg|the file description page]] and add the text &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{di-replaceable fair use disputed|&lt;your reason&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; '''below''' the original replaceable fair use template, replacing &lt;code&gt;&lt;your reason&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a short explanation of why the file is not replaceable.
# On [[File talk:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg|the file discussion page]], write a full explanation of why you believe the file is not replaceable.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media item by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license]], or by creating new media yourself (for example, by taking your own photograph of the subject).

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these media fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target=Richardlender&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, non-free media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006), per the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|non-free content policy]].  If you have any questions, please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:di-replaceable fair use-notice --&gt; [[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 14:18, 6 June 2014 (UTC)
==Orphaned non-free image File:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:32px; line-height:1em&quot;&gt;'''[[Image:Ambox warning blue.svg|35px|left|âš |link=]]'''&lt;/span&gt; Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Mount Calvary Church Sanctuary on Reception into Full Communion.jpeg]]'''. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, the image is currently not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

Note that any non-free images not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described in the [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F5|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-orphaned fair use-notice --&gt; [[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 14:18, 6 June 2014 (UTC)
