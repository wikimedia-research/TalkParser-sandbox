[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic london]]. I noticed that you recently made an edit to [[:Nathan (given name)]] that seemed to be a test.

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is your '''last warning'''. The next time you [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalize]] Wikipedia, as you did at [[:John Schnatter]], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]] without further notice'''. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism4 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning4 --&gt; [[User:Favonian|Favonian]] ([[User talk:Favonian|talk]]) 19:11, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot; style=&quot;min-height: 40px&quot;&gt; [[Image:Stop x nuvola.svg|40px|left|alt=|link=]] You have been '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]]''' '''indefinitely''' from editing because your account is [[Wikipedia:Vandalism-only account|being used only for vandalism]].   If you think there are good reasons why you should be unblocked, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding below this notice the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx|&quot; code. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|2=reason=''Your reason here &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''}}, but you should read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first.

{{unblock reviewed|reason=Please
|decline=I am declining your unblock request because it does not address the reason for your block, or because it is inadequate for other reasons. To be unblocked, you must convince the reviewing administrator(s) that 
*the block is not necessary to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia, &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt;
*the block is no longer necessary because you
*#understand what you have been blocked for,
*#will not continue to cause damage or disruption, and
*#will make useful contributions instead.
