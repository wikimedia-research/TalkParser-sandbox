It ''is'' important. It has a possible ability to help in the search for the proof of the Reimann hypothesis.
 
can we move it to the twin primes article?  i agree, the improtance tag is not needed  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Loud neighbors|Loud neighbors]] ([[User talk:Loud neighbors|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Loud neighbors|contribs]]) 23:32, 28 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

It's definitely important. See the steep slope followed by the straight line on the &quot;5000th prime&quot; curve here?

That's because this project accounted for so many primes on the [[Prime Pages]] top 5000 prime list that it took almost two years to push them off the list. It also found many large [[Primes in arithmetic progression]]: http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=83392
