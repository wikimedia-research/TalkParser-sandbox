It's a stub, it's obvious the article is totally incomplete. --[[Special:Contributions/185.34.28.184|185.34.28.184]] ([[User talk:185.34.28.184#top|talk]]) 15:35, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

:Stripping out the only references it has as well as the tag calling for more references isn't improving it. Doing it repeatedly is vandalism. [[User:Helpsome|Helpsome]] ([[User talk:Helpsome|talk]]) 15:40, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

These (2) reference are either UNRELIABLE (&quot;[[random.access]]&quot;) or REPEATING (repeating for no reason, 3 times for a single sentence that needs to have a ref at the end and that's it). This is omething I told you already. If you want to be helpful, find some good references and improve the article beyond stub. --[[Special:Contributions/185.34.28.184|185.34.28.184]] ([[User talk:185.34.28.184#top|talk]]) 15:45, 20 May 2015 (UTC)
