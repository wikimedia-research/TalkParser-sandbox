==Unreferenced BLPs==
[[File:Information.svg|30px]] Hello Cadillac! Thank you for your contributions. I am a [[WP:BOT|bot]] alerting you that '''1''' of the articles that you created   is tagged as an[[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Sources| Unreferenced Biography of a Living Person]]. The [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] policy requires that all personal or potentially controversial information be sourced. In addition, to ensure [[WP:VERRIFY|verifiability]], all biographies should be based on [[WP:RELIABLE|reliable sources]]. If you were to bring this article up to standards, it would greatly help us with the current ''[[:Category:All_unreferenced_BLPs|{{PAGESINCATEGORY:All_unreferenced_BLPs}}]]'' article backlog. Once the article is adequately referenced, please remove the {{tl|unreferencedBLP}} tag. Here is the article:

# [[Jay E. Adams]] - &lt;small&gt;{{findsources|Jay E. Adams}}&lt;/small&gt;

==[[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Jay E. Adams]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]

The article [[Jay E. Adams]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:&lt;b&gt;This group of articles seems to be promotional and relies almost totally on self-interested sources.&lt;/b&gt;

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Jay E. Adams|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist.  The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion process]] can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; [[User:Gigs|Gigs]] ([[User talk:Gigs|talk]]) 19:47, 25 January 2010 (UTC)
