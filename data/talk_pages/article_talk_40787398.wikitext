== David Brayton article ==

I deleted it but can restore it if you can source it and write it neutrally. I was very negative and unsourced, so could not remain at Wikipedia. It also looked a bit like it was copy pasted from somewhere. Was it? Many thanks, [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 10:23, 14 October 2013 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Gamaliel|Gamaliel]]. I noticed that you made a comment on the page [[:User:Scoobydunk]] that didn't seem very [[Wikipedia:Civility|civil]], so it has been removed. Wikipedia needs people like you and me to collaborate, so it's one of our core principles to interact with one another in a polite and respectful manner. If you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Gamaliel|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-npa1 --&gt; [[User:Gamaliel|&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkGreen;&quot;&gt;Gamaliel&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Gamaliel|&lt;span style=&quot;color:DarkGreen;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:07, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

[[File:Information orange.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not add commentary or your own [[Wikipedia:No original research|personal analysis]] to Wikipedia articles, as you did to [[Democrat Party (epithet)]]. Doing so violates Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view policy]] and breaches the formal tone expected in an encyclopedia.  Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-npov2 --&gt;--[[User:Orangemike|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#F80&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/span&gt;]] &amp;#124; [[User talk:Orangemike|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FA0&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 23:12, 28 June 2015 (UTC)
