== Criticism section ==

Removed the criticism section; it was improperly placed, with some of the History bits falling under the criticism header, and it consisted of one line quoting an obscure newsblog. Not only that, the line was from the user comments section, though it at least appears to have been made by the site owners. The line was &quot;Microsoft has been criticized for offering cash over innovation.&quot; with a ref to http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/05/21/economy-to-piggyback-microsoft.
