Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Mysky2.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{tl|GFDL}} to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], and then use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use]].  See [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you. [[User:Sherool|Sherool]] &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:75%&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Sherool|(talk)]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:49, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
