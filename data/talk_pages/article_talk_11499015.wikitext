==PFAW classification==
Under Opponents, People for the American Way is listed as a religious organization. PFAW doesn't have any religious or spiritual affiliations. However, they DO fight back at the American Religious Right. Their name should be replaced in that sentence to the name of a religious group that's opposed to reparative therapy. I could make the change, but I thought I'd run it by the talk page first just to make sure it's ok with everyone else.

Seems to me that castration would cure heterosexuality also. Seems to me that whoever thought up that &quot;cure&quot; was suffering a short-circuit...

==Location on the pro-con spectrum==

This looks spectacularly partial. It is not neutral at all. Clearly pro–RT. --A Reader 12:08, 3 Nov 2004 (CET) 

I'm not going to disagree with your edit, OuterLimits, but it seems that Fowler made at least '''one''' statement that wasn't against reparative therapy:

*If ... there is a desire to talk about changing, that is '''an acceptable choice''' and '''a psychologist may participate''' ...&quot; (quotation sliced and diced for talk page purposes)

But it's important to add the first part you added, where he says RT is trying to change the immutable. I myself question any attempt to make people change natural, beneficial characteristics to fit a social agenda. 

Perhaps we agree on the &quot;no coercion&quot; part but only disagree on the &quot;gay is good&quot; part.  --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 18:26, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:His statement indicates that he's unwilling to characterize RT as '''unethical'''. That he had to clarify that point should be taken as an indication that many psychologists do consider it unethical, and that many psychologists feel that the APA should take that position. His statement doesn't make him &quot;neutral&quot; on the subject, and websites that take his statement out of context and imply that he ''is'' neutral are being manipulative and dishonest. As for your latter point, I'm quite certain I've never stated that &quot;gay is good&quot;. I am not shocked to learn that you think &quot;gay is bad&quot;. - [[User:Outerlimits|Outerlimits]] 18:54, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::Yes, yes, of course: my mistake. He's not neutral on the '''subject''', i.e., whether reparative therapy is harmful. And of course many if not most 'cologists and 'chiatrists oppose it. The last thing I want to do is take anyone's statement out of context.

::Perhaps the article should say that Fowler opposes RT but '''doesn't oppose''' the right of mutually agreeing client and therapist to try it? (Your call.)

::By the way, it really helps me when I can discuss the fine points with someone who's really familiar with the material, the viewpoints, and the posturing of the various sides. I'm aiming for a balanced portrayal. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 20:32, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:::With all due respect, this is not exactly a ''fine point''. If your goal is a balanced, informative article, you can probably achieve that goal best by actually reading Besen's book, or by reading about the subject in some other source - one that is not specifically chosen because you know in advance that you agree with it. I think the strategy of adding a one-sided opinion and relying on others to actually do the research needed to balance it will produce a debate rather than a decent article. It also gives the appearance that you are more interested in promoting a particular view than in a balanced article, which certainly can't be the case. (I'd also encourage you not to rely too heavily on NARTH or other websites with agendas to provide quotes, as they are unreliable, and, as I think this example shows, dishonest.) - [[User:Outerlimits|Outerlimits]] 03:57, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Detailed Analysis of POV ==

Here follows are detailed analysis of my objections to the POV on this page.

:''Reparative therapy, or conversion therapy, is any of several voluntary techniques that are aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation from homosexuality to heterosexuality. Their efficacy has not been established, and most professionals warn that such attempts may be psychologically harmful. Most pro-therapy advocates believe that homosexuality is itself either a psychological disorder, a tendancy toward immoral and harmful behaviors (to oneself and others), or both.''

First of all, the use of the word &quot;voluntary&quot; is somewhat controversial. Whilst there is no evidence that people are forced to undergo reparative therapy, opponents would argue that social pressures placed on gay individuals, particualrly in isolated, rural areas with a strong Christian presence where reparative therapy is most popular, is a subtle method of co-ercing people into reparative therapy. Also, are not some adolescents forced into reparative therapy by their parents?

Also, I notice the start paragraph makes no mention of the [[ex-gay]] movement which seems directly related. Yet, the ex-gay page references reparative therapy in its starting paragraph... how strange!

=== Controversy ===

:''Reparative therapy can be divided into two categories: secular and religious. Secular reparative therapy seeks to distance itself from religion and morality, basing itself on object relations theory and empirical studies in gender identity.''

I'm not sure why my notes that secular reparative therapy actually descends from religious reparative therapy? I also made a statement that whilst some reparative therapy appears to be secular it tends to be funded mostly by religious institutions and seems to possess only the appearence of secularism. Are there any reasons why this was deleted? Were they in dispute?

:''In general, one's position on reparative therapy will be determined by one's position on the cause of homosexuality: Is it genetic or environmental?''

Not at all: one could (and some do) hold that homosexuality is changeable but that there is no reason to change. Similarly, one might argue that whilst homosexuality is changeable, it may be damaging and thus prohibitive to do so. One might better make the argument that one's position on reparative depends on whether you think homosexuality is a good or a bad thing.

:''Sexual orientation is defined as an individual's amorous desires, but it also refers to his feelings and self-concept, all of which might not remain static over a lifetime. Attempts have been made to measure this change, for example, by the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid.''

For starters, shouldn't discussion of what sexual orientation is be left to the sexual orientation page (which is not linked to for some reason?!?).

:''Since feelings, self-concept and preference can change over time, the belief that this change might be consciously ellicited with the aid of therapy arises.''

This smells a lot of [[Wikipedia:weasel words|weasel words]]. Obviously, this question arises in regard to sexual orientation for particular groups of people, in this context those who believe in reparative therapy.

:''Sexologist Alfred Kinsey also showed that, even in the modern age, &quot;[e]xclusive preferences of behavior, heterosexual or homosexual, come only with experience, or as the result of social pressures which tend to force an individual into an exclusive pattern of one or the other sort.&quot;''

This rather ignores the considerable evidence and subsequent arguments that has since rendered the above conclusions somewhat obsolete. I think more contemporary reports on sexual orientation are more relevant and considered.

:''Supporters of reparative therapy believe that homosexuality is not a fixed sexual orientation but an emotional disorder which a person can change. This viewpoint has not only a moral, but an historical basis. In the words of Francis Mondimore: &quot;The word homosexuality did not exist prior to 1869.... This idea - that some individuals' sexual attraction for persons of the same sex was an inherent and unchanging aspect of their personality - was radically new.&quot;1 Just as homosexuality had been seen, historically, as a behaviour, and not a state of being, so do modern-day Reparative Therapists see homosexuality as a chosen, and oftentimes compulsive, behaviour that can be modified or cured.''

More [[Wikipedia:weasel words|weasel words]]: we are well aware the supporters of reparative therapy think sexual orientation is changeable. The above is someone's opinion regarding homosexuality but is presented here, unchallenged, as reasonable opinion. Also, who is Francis Mondimore? Why should we believe what he says?

:''here are anecdotal reports of successful conversions, total reversions, and partially successful conversions (in which the subjects still had some homosexual feelings/attractions). Reparative therapists say this variability in success should not be viewed as a therapeutic failure, for, in the words of Otto Weininger''

::''&quot;[T]he rudiment of homosexuality, in however weak a form, exists in every human being.... There is no friendship between men that has not an element of sexuality in it, however little accentuated it may be in the nature of the friendship, and however painful the idea of the sexual element would be. But it is enough to remember that there can be no friendship unless there has been some attraction to draw the men together.&quot;''

Not really sure what the above says: the quote does not seem to support the asssertion. Also, this stuff (as in previous sections) seems to belong in the propoenent section rather than in the factual description of reparative therapy.

:''This theory is, however, unsubstantiated by empirical evidence, although its dynamic is clearly in evidence in the gay scene, where it is most desirable to have had a large number of masculine lovers.&quot;''

Again, a dubious assertion at best. Highly contentious, needs substantial evidence to back up anecdotal evidence and should otherwise be deleted. Also, contradictory: we state there is no evidence and then claim there is evidence.

:''Should this rigidity turn out to one day become proven fact, then one would have to ask: Why can a heterosexual preference evolve into a homosexual one, but a homosexual preference or self-concept can never evolve at all?''

Should one have to ask this? Again, leading question and more weasel words do not really leave the question open, the question answers itself.

The controversy section does not to explain the controversy, but seeks to eliminate it in favor of reparative therapy.

=== History ===

:''The belief in the need for such 'cures' arose from the redefinition of homosexuality as a medical illness from the former view that it was a sinful choice''

The above is presented in a highly dubious light: it gives the opinion that, prior to the definition of homosexuality everyone thought homosexuality was a sin. There are many other problems with this sentence:

* homosexuality was not &quot;redefined&quot; but defined.
* prior to the classification of homosexuality it was not considered to be a &quot;sinful choice&quot; but the sexual activity was considered to be a sinful and criminal activity.
* this was only a crime for a narrow point in history, but this statement leads one to believe it had always been a crime - and sodomy and buggary laws are relative new.

:''Modern reparative therapy is a re-reading of this early psychological research and stems from the clinical work and theories of Elizabeth Moberly, a British Christian theologian. In her book, 'Homosexuality: A new Christian ethic', she states that homosexuality is purely a result of environmental factors, primarily a failure to bond with the subject's father as opposed to the domineering mother theory in Freudian psychoanalysis. The subject, as a boy, first experiences rejection by his father, then lapses into helplessness, and finally retreats to the security of his mother and defensively detaches from his father. This defensive detachment emotionally isolates him from other males, and from his own masculinity''

More needs to be done here to make it clear that the above are the theories of Mobery, and not fact. Also, how is this historical? This is merely explaining what reparative therapy is and what it holds, rather than historical detail and belongs in another section. The rest of this section continues in a similar vein, incorrectly describing reparative doctrine as history.

=== Proponents ===

:''Initially, reparative therapy was welcomed by many 'Ex-Gay' and homosexual Christian groups who saw it as a means of reconciling their beliefs with their sexuality and as a way of gaining greater acceptance in their respective churches or ministries.:''

This sentence fragment is obviously part of a parapraph I wrote describing that some ex-gay groups have since turned away from reparative therapy. Why was this deleted?

:''Reparative therapists claim that the psychological community has submitted to political forces, harming people while witholding treatment for their illness... homosexuality.''

This sentence seems to hang in the air, devoid of any context and seeking a proper paragraph to be part of. It's also highly emotive and, again, uses weasel words to highlight it's sub-text. It would be better if it were described in the context of opposition from various professional bodies and toned down.

=== Opponents ===

:''There are people and groups who oppose these therapies, usually on the grounds that there is little scientific evidence that the techniques work. There is also opposition from the those who espouse the cultural argument that homosexuality is not immoral or harmful to the individual or society.''

Again, this paragraph contains so much unconcious and subtle bias it will take a large effort to untangle all the threads. For starters, &quot;There are people and groups&quot; is pretty weasel words. It would be better to go straight into a description of those parties who directly oppose reparative therapy. Also, there are more grounds for oppososition than the &quot;little scienfitic evidence&quot; argument and the author of this work should be aware of this. The use of the word &quot;espouse&quot; is particularly pernicious, having very negative conotations. The term &quot;cultural argument&quot; is highly POV and should be replaced. Finally, the phrase &quot;homosexuality is not immoral or harmful to the individual or society&quot; is highly POV, working as it does from the assumption that homosexuality is immoral and harmful. Finally, this sentence contradicts the earlier view stated that &quot;one's position on reparative therapy will be determined by one's position on the cause of homosexuality&quot;.

In fact, this is possibly the most POV and biased paragraph in the entire article, with it's multiple implicit assumptions.

:''The difficulty with the claim that the scientific evidence for change does not exist is that many studies indicate that while change is not a universal phenomena, for some percentage of individuals who orient toward homosexuality, some orientation change does occur. For instance, Ben Newman's Research Shows Change Is Real (http://pathinfo.ihostsites.net/Change_Is_Real.htm) discusses 48 studies of homosexuality with regard to the question, &quot;Is change possible?&quot; Every study listed included some evidence of a heterosexual shift in subjects' sexual orientation, and some count as &quot;success&quot; an increase in heterosexual daydreams unaccompanied by any lessening of the number of homosexual acts. The 48 include studies by partisan groups such as NARTH, and many are old and are methodologically dated, which is to be expected, as the political pressures by gay rights groups are such that any attempt at testing and study are quashed by the APA and other governing bodies.''

Wow! I thought the last paragraph was bad! There is substantial scientific evidence that homosexuality is decided at birth, and the evidence that change is possible contended on multiple fronts and ignores [[bisexuality]]. This section is higly POV, highly contentious, and certainly belongs in the controversy section and definately not in the opponents section!

:''Those who are convinced that homosexuality is caused by genetic factors may view conversion therapy not only as an impotent, but a potentially damaging, pseudoscience. They attempt to present it as a manifestation of religious fundamentalism and intolerance of minorities, but prefer to ignore the fact that those afflicted with unwanted and intrusive homosexual thoughts seek the help voluntarily.''

''sigh'' Again, the above is ridiculously biased. Dubious statements include:

* ''Those who are convinced''
* ''may view'' - they certainly do view it as such
* ''They attempt to present it as'' - they attempt to do so!?? do they not succeed in some cases?
* ''prefer to ignore the fact that those afflicted with unwanted and intrusive homosexual thoughts seek the help voluntarily'' - this itself is contentious as has been deatiled earlier.

:''Both the theory and practice have come under heavy criticism from gay rights groups, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the National Association of Social Workers, the Royal College of Nursing and other organizations.''

This does not explain that opposition comes from a variety of groups, but the above are the main opponents. Makes it sound like its only some sort of gay rights crusade, which is misleading and POV.

This section is supposed to be about opposition, but one could be mistaken for thinking you are reading the proponents section. Unbeliavably biased. It seems the further you go down this essay the less effort is made to hide the bias.

=== Techniques ===

This whole section should be at the head of the page rather than at the bottom.

:''Some religious individuals may express that the power of prayer and of reading scripture, as forms of guidance and self-reflection, ought never to be underestimated; however they cannot be considered a part of therapy per se''

Does it? Who says this?

:''Whether aversion therapy and fasting are used by any contemporary practitioners remains unclear. They are certainly not mentioned by Dr. Joseph Nicolosi, who is the author of the primary manual on Reparative Therapy.''

Does it? I thought I found plenty of evidence that aversion therapy is used which I clearly cited when I made my edits.

=== The Bigger Picture ===

:''Although same-sex sex acts seem (both to reparative therapists and to some others) to contravene human anatomical structure and design, a propensity for an emotional bisexuality would seem to exist, as is evidenced by the male need for cameraderie and bonding. It is in the fulfilment of these unfulfilled needs that the cure - the relief from unwanted same-sex sexual attraction, is found. Hence, it is not the innate emotional need for same-sex bonding that Reparative Therapy tries to correct, but what reparative therapists see as its dysfunctional expressions.''

This whole section should be deleted, and its arguments moved to the controversy or proponents section. It does not belong in any &quot;neutral&quot; summary of reparative therapy.

=== Summary of Analysis ===

In summary, this whole page has been so completely seeded with leading questions, weasel words and subtle bias that I don't know how to begin altering it to be more neutral. A lot of this material could (and perhaps should) be merged with the [[ex-gay]] page which is, apart from anything, else a much more balanced and more popular link than the more obscure reparative therapy page where such bias can continue to be published unnoticed by other editors. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 18:29, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I have submitted a new version of the document which, I hopes, deals with the above issues. Comments wellcome. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 15:16, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Terminology ==

I dispute the NPOV of the title of this piece: reparative therapy itself is a controversial term with its implicit assumption that the therapies are actually healing and non-harmful (which is in dispute). I would argue that conversion therapy is more neutral and there is evidence that a substantial number of people use this term (Google both phrases). I would like to change the name of this article as well as replace uses of reparative therapy with conversion therapy. I still think the introduction should descibe the synonyms and we should keep the Terminlogy section itself. I think there is an argument for continuing to refer to reparative therapists as such - isn't there a rule in Wikipedia that groups should be named by the term they prefer themselves? Although, of course, most gay man and women do not prefer to be called homosexual, yet Wikipedia frequently refers to them as such so maybe this point is moot. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 15:16, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Conversion therapy seems like a much more neutral term.  &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; implies damage that needs repairing, which should be something for the reader to decide for themselves.  There is in fact a guideline about that, though I don't remember if it applied to a situation such as this.  Perhaps we could continue to call the reparative therapists as such, and just move the terminology section closer to the top to avoid confusion.  --[[User:Crazy Wolf|Crazy Wolf]] 08:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== History from Moberly to Nicolsi ==

I'd be interested in some more details regarding the history of reparative therapy from Moberly to Nicolosi. I skip from where Moberly first posits her theory and therapy straight to when it is in action in America. Some details of how Nicolsi et al adopted Moberly's work and following on from there. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 15:16, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== History of Religious Therapies ==

The article focuses of secular therapies, but what about the history of religious conversion therapies? More work needs to be done here. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 15:16, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Fowler Quotes ==

:&quot;...sexual orientation is not a choice and cannot be altered. Groups who try to change the sexual orientation of people through so-called 'conversion therapy' are misguided and run the risk of causing a great deal of psychological harm...&quot; Raymond Fowler, executive director, American Psychological Association.

:&quot;If an individual is comfortable with his or her homosexuality, it is not the role of the therapist to convince the client otherwise. If one's feelings are egodystonic and there is a desire to talk about changing, that is an acceptable choice and a psychologist may participate if he or she desires.&quot; Ray Fowler, PhD, CEO, American Psychological Association. (From the Utah Psychologist, Winter, 1998, p. 11.)

I deleted both these quotes. My reasons are that, whilst on first glance appearing to be contradictory and reflecting a change of mind, they are actually not contradictory. Fowler could very easily hold the position that, whilst conversion therapy is dangerous, it is acceptable for a participant to undergo reparative therapy if the is what he or she wishes.

Also, both quotations are ordered sequentially seeming to indicate the Fowlers opinion changed from against to pro-RP, but there is no indication that the quotes belong in this order. If Fowler has changed his mind that RP is acceptable then I agree this should be mentioned in the article, but if he still thinks that reparative therapy is wrong, or has changed from a pro-stance to and anti-stance then I see no reason to include it. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 15:16, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Category change ==

I'm moving this to [[:Category:Ex-gay movement]] because [[:Category:LGBT]] was too full, and there are a bunch of related articles on changing, repairing, or whatever, homosexuals, and it's nice to have them collected all in one place.  &quot;Ex-gay movement&quot; might not be the best name; if anyone can think of a better one, feel free to nominate the category for re-naming on [[WP:CFD]].  -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 04:41, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Bias Information ==

This information is biased and does not present enough facts to let people come to their own conclusion. I've been involved with reparative therapy for 2 years and have seen drastic results. The only thing i've done was read the book and participated on peoplecanchange.com forum to gain a better understanding of some underlying issues. Like cigarette smoking, some people have different results when it comes to quiting. My results are shocking! I was not totally convinced that change could take place. I have never considered myself bisexual which is the weak excuse used by opponents to say we are crazy and can't tell the difference in our attractions, as if we were stupid or something. This is not about science. It is about politics and people not being objective but double in their standards.

I hope the truth comes out and the playing field will be levelled and people can decide for themselves whether they want to change or not. True, some people do have a harder time than others. But for me, it as not very difficult at all. I saw significant results in a year and have sustained these. My attactions to the same sex are nearly zero if not zero. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. All i had to do was understand my underlying needs and causing and change my thinking. As a former homosexual, i know, this sounds extremely over simplified and maybe irrational. But hopefully in the near future there will be more of us. Then because of the sheer numbers, you will come to believe that at least some are capable of change.

:Good luck to you, but what precisely do you object to in the article? The editors have tried to present all the information in as neutral a way as possible and I think the page succeeds very well at this. As a proponent of reparative therapy I would be interested in your perspective. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 17:20, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Sorry for taking so long. Defending reparative therapy is not my livelihood and i try not to reply to such discussions at work. I had begun a reply but was not satisfied with it.

Although the encyclopedia has to reflect the current professional opinion, i think it needs to discuss better the political bias.  Many will agree taht homosexuality was removed from the book of mental disorders because of political reasons and fear of aiding or causing discrimination. Reparative therapy is also not given the attention it needs, not because of much or overwhelming scientific study, as some would have us believe, but because it is simply politically incorrect and assumed a pseudo-science.  

:I would disagree that &quot;many&quot; people agree that &quot;homosexuality was removed from the book of mental disorders because of political reasons&quot; - on the contrary, there was considerable studies at the time that demonstrated that homosexuals could function normally and healthily. That aside, I'm not sure if this is the page to discuss this. This page is about reparative therapy.

:I think the page does adequately describe the position that RT is dismissed because of political reasons. It clearly attributes these claims to RT proponents which I think is valid. If you think this page misses any points that you are free to add them but they should be placed in the correct context. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 09:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

I believe the encyclopedia would be more unbiased to at least explain the counter-cultural environment in which reparative therapy much fight.  By explaining the effects of politics curious individuals can see that it is not just proven science that discredits reparative therapy but an opposing culture (created and propagated by the Gay Rights Movement). Besides there is no CONCLUSIVE proof that homosexuality is biological. There is only speculation. Since i'm a homosexual myself, i know this is foolishness! 

:This page is about RT and not discussing whether or not homosexuality is inherent or genetic (there are other pages for this). If you wish to describe the polical bias or a counter culture RT must fight against  that would be valid, but I think you should attribute these claims of political bias/correctness to those who make them - that is RT proponents - and be careful not go state them as undisputed fact --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 09:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

Spitzer's study is also unreasonably criticized a few times in the Wikipedia. Many studies done in support of homosexuality have small sample sizes. Just because the group did not contain a larger or more varied population, such as those who would normally fail at so-called reparative therapy, does not mean anything. He addresses the limitations in his study and compares his limitations to others opposing studies. Spitzer's study  defined whether anyone was having success -- not the frequency of success.  When one looks at the frequency of success there are various reasons why people don't succeed.  Spitzer raises a good question in this culture bent on promoting homosexuality. The question is: 'although many homosexuals prefer to remain homosexual or find it difficult to change, are there any individuals who have succeeded?'  Just as with smoking and any other problem, a person may not have the will power, desire or the ability to change underlying issues. Some people just outright refuse to confront themselves. I find these people on both sides. Many do not have the tools, or are not mature enough, to analyze themselves. Since reparative therapists claim that SSAD springs from unmet childhood needs and/or from some psychological trauma, the question of whether many strugglers really have the tools to examine themselves is a valid question. Some have further exprienced rejection from family, religion, and other social environments that may obscure their ability to be perceptive and objective. Thus the term &quot;internal homophobia.&quot;  They aren't sure if their confusion springs from possible fears due to an anti-gay culture or valid internal issues. It is further claimed that pressure excelerates same sex desires. In such cases many will take the path of least resistence.

:The content on the Spitzer report is cited from other pages on the Internet and other studies. In this sense I do not believe it is unreasonable criticised. How can criticism be unreasonable if it is valid and backed up with first and secondary sources? You also claim that Spitzer backed up the assertion of RT proponents that homosexuialty is &quot;promoted&quot; but Spitzer himself noted that his own study did not demonstrate the efficacy of RT that it's proponents claim and dismissed any of the political ramifications of his study. --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 09:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

If i have time, i will try to pull together some quotes even if they are simply &quot;the concerns&quot; of proponents of reparative therapy.  My goal is to at least explain that the current culture is one of the biggest obstacles to an open discuss about reparative therapy. 

Thanks for your reply. I will try to be a little more engaged in this discussion.

I clicked on Axon since it was trailed by numbers (ie 17:4) to make sure i understood what it meant and found your name listed amoung Queer Wikipedians. What does that mean?  And yet are you a proponent of reparative therapy?

:Apologies: let me clarify. I am not an RT proponent, I was referring to you as an RT proponent in my comment above although the sentence I wrote is indeed misleading --[[User:Axon|Axon]] 09:53, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

== Reparative therapy has occasionally been used rather loosely ==

Hi [[User:Outerlimits|Outerlimits]]. I do not necesarily dispute this change[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12916583] (although it probably needs a bit of copyedit as it sounds a little like [[weasel words]]) but I'd be interested in your reasoning behind it. I've always been aware that reparative therapy not only covers the counselling therapies of NARTH ''et al'' but also the rather more brutal attempts by various ministries.

:Reparative therapy is not the name for all attempts to alter sexuality; many such attempts, and attempts at &quot;cures&quot; occurred long before &quot;reparative therapy&quot; was invented, conceived of, or referred to.  It's necessary to indicate that so we do not mislead people. That you have chosen to label this indication a &quot;weasel word&quot; doesn't make it any less necessary: I prefer to call it a nuanced treatment of a serious subject. - [[User:Outerlimits|Outerlimits]] 07:24, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

* ''&quot;'''Reparative therapy''', or '''conversion therapy''', is any of several controversial religious or [[secular]] techniques that are aimed at changing a person's [[sexual orientation]] from [[homosexuality]] to [[heterosexuality]] (or [[ex-gay]]).''&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=14323183&amp;oldid=14323137] Deleting the the statement that reparative therapy is controversial is POV: the findings and results of reparative therapists are highly contested. Similarly, some of the techniques are considered religious by some and it is POV to not mention this.

* ''&quot;most professionals warn&quot;'' -&gt; ''&quot;some professionals warn&quot;''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=14323183] I reverted this because a clear majority of professionals do warn against reparative therapy. If you have any evidence against this please cite it here to back it up.

* ''&quot;[http://www.evergreeninternational.org/ Evergreen International]&quot;''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=14323137&amp;oldid=14322237] Wikipedia seems quite clear on the subject of vanity pages, advertisments. I'm unsure if, as you claim Evergreen International is one of the largest organisations. There is no article for this org on Wikipedia, and the last article created was deleted. [[User:Axon|Axon]] 10:42, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

::Axon, A quick visit to the Evergreen Web site would tell you this is a large organization. It has been around for 25 years, providing referrals, information, bookstores, annual conferences, workshops, speakers' bureau, etc. It serves thousands of individuals, has 46 affiliate groups worldwide, and a large Web site which receives 3.6 million hits a year. It was one of the original founders of the coalition of 15 Christian organizations (PATH) mentioned in the article on [[Homosexuality and psychology]]. I've resubmitted the article on this organization, since it is clearly one of the major organizations. I'll also resubmit the article on Evergreen.

:::Hi Richman9, whilst the above may well be true, I'm not sure we can consider the evidence from the Evergreen web site itself. For example, a search on the Exgaywatch.com site (which maybe an anti-RP site but does also cover a wide range of reparative therapy issues) returns only 1 hit. Similarly, a [[Wikipedia:Google test|Google test]] on google groups returns only 10 hits for EI[http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=%22evergreen%20international%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg] but 7,020 hits for NARTH[http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=%22narth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg] and 2,350 hits for Exodus International [http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=%22exodus%20international%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wg].

* ''&quot;Opponents argue that therapists espousing ''any'' form of therapy, may be motivated by financial interests. The financial funding mentioned in the article above refers to funding of ex-gay organizations, and not any direct funding to therapists.&quot;'' I'm not sure what evidence there is that &quot;Opponents argue that therapists espousing ''any'' form of therapy, may be motivated by financial interests&quot; - this seems like [[weasel words]] to me, or at least a POV statement. I'm pretty sure that funding to ex-gay organsations such as NARTH and Exodus International are used to pay the salaries of reparative therapists. What evidence do you have that no such funding exists? I am deleting both these sentences: the former should not be here, the later needs backing up.

* ''&quot;Some of the more extreme therapies that have been&quot;'' ''&quot;of the more extreme therapies that were used many years ago&quot;'' This is just [[weasel words]] - the section already makes it clear that these techniques may be no longer used.

* ''&quot;However, longer-term studies have been conducted and published and more data is being collected showing positive success. Proponents of reparative therapy argue that individuals who are conflicted over their same-sex attractions have the right to decide whether to seek counseling or therapy, what kind of counseling to seek, to be made aware of all alternatives, and to determine the desired direction of their own therapy program. They believe professional organizations should enhance rather than inhibit the client's right of self-determination.&quot;'' Please cite these studies from reputable sources you claim demonstrate positive success.

::There are two issues in the note above. I'll address each one separately:
::#About the studies published that shows efficacy of RT. Below are examples:
:::*An article in the October 1998 issue (volume 20, pages 283-304) of the Journal of Mental Health Counseling that concludes that efforts to assist homosexually oriented individuals who wish to modify their patterns of sexual arousal have been effective, can be conducted in an ethical manner, and should be available to those clients requesting such assistance. Another is...
:::*For a list of dozens of published studies on the numbers of people who have changed as a result of RT, see http://www.peoplecanchange.com/Is_Change_Possible.htm (it's about half way down the page). See also http://www.newdirection.ca/a_change.htm and http://www.evergreeninternational.org/Throckmorton.htm. 
:::* In 1994, Dr. Houston MacIntosh reported in the ''Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association'' (vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 1183-1207) a survey of 285 psychoanalysts who treated 1,215 homosexual patients. The psychoanalysts reported that 23% of the patients changed to heterosexuality and 84% received significant therapeutic benefit.
::::* As I understand it, the same study also reported that &quot;285 psychoanalysts who together had treated 1,215 homosexual patients. 7) When asked whether a homosexual patient 'can and should change to heterosexuality,' 278 (97.6 percent) answered in the negative.&quot; and that, indeed, &quot;a majority of psychiatrists responding to MacIntosh's survey believe that homosexually oriented patients cannot change.&quot;[http://johnnyskeptic.com/] [[User:Axon|Axon]] 10:31, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:::* A Masters &amp; Johnson study showed the recovery rate from homosexuality at 71.6% when there was motivation and support. (See ''Homosexuality in Perspective,'' William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, Bantam, New York, 1979, p. 416.)
::::* Was this published in a peer-reviewed journal? This seems to me to be a self-published report. [[User:Axon|Axon]] 10:31, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:::* For her doctoral dissertation at Brigham Young University in 1978, Elizabeth James conducted perhaps the most comprehensive review of the literature on the treatment of homosexuality that had been conducted to date. In her analysis of 101 studies that had been published from 1930 to 1976, she found that approximately 35% of the clients recovered and 27% improved. She concluded that &quot;significant improvement and even complete recovery are entirely possible.&quot; She noted an 81% recovery and improvement rate for bisexuals, 69% for long-term therapy clients, 53% for short-term therapy clients, and 42% for exclusively homosexual clients. (See ''Treatment of Homosexuality: A Reanalysis and Synthesis of Outcome Studies, doctoral dissertation, BYU, Provo, UT 1978 to see the lists of these 101 published studies.)
::::* Again, was this published in a peer-reviewed journal? A dissertation is not necesarily equivalent. [[User:Axon|Axon]] 10:31, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:::* See also the heading Observations of Others at http://www.evergreeninternational.org/overcome.htm.
::#You proposed no arguement to the statement about an individual's right to therapy. This is a key point by proponents of RT, and isn't mentioned in this article. I believe it needs to be. Please reinsert the following sentences: ''Proponents of reparative therapy argue that individuals who are conflicted over their same-sex attractions have the right to decide whether to seek counseling or therapy, what kind of counseling to seek, to be made aware of all alternatives, and to determine the desired direction of their own therapy program. They believe professional organizations should enhance rather than inhibit the client's right of self-determination.&quot;'' This is a rational argument by proponents of RT, and is supported by the psychological profession. For example, the American Psychological Association's prestigious journal ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'' published a comprehensive research paper in the June 2002 issue on sexual-orientation change and said that clients have the right to pursue change because &quot;sexual orientation, once thought to be an unchanging trait, is actually quite flexible for some people.&quot; This was also supported in the lead article in the January 2003 issue of the ''Journal of Marital and Family Therapy (JMFT)''. Even noted researches and gay advocates Simon LeVay and Douglas Haldeman acknowledge that RT is a legitimate and should be permissible out of respect for client choice and autonomy. (See http://narth.com/docs/legitimate.html.)
::::I can see no reason not to include the above so long as it is an opinoin ascribed to proponents and it is put into the correct section in the article. I do dispute that the above position is supported by the mainstream. [[User:Axon|Axon]] 10:31, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
* ''&quot;At the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association on May 9, 2001, Dr. Spitzer reported that the findings of his study show that &quot;some people can and do change. Like most psychiatrists, I thought that homosexual behavior could only be resisted, and that no one could really change their sexual orientation. I now believe this to be false.&quot;&quot;'' Spitzer's findings have already been discussed at length in this section. The addition of this section at the end of the article seems like point scoring.

* ''&quot;Results are not published in peer reviewed journals but tend to be&quot;''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=14321534&amp;oldid=14321295]  the deletion of this sentence is highly POV: if you have evidence that reparative therapist's results have been pubished in peer review journals please cite them. Also, this opionion is attribtud to opponents who clearly do hold this view.

* ''&quot;and the fact that reports are published exclusively in non-peer reviewed journals, in particular [[Psychological Reports]], which has been criticised for its lack of peer review and strong, anti-gay bias.&quot;''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=14320943&amp;oldid=14320879] Ditto

Cut from article:

:One of the most controversial aspects of reparative therapy has been the focus on gay teenagers, including occasions where teenagers have been forcibly treated in 'ex-gay' camps. This came to public attention after 

That's using the wrong word: &quot;controversial&quot; doesn't mean &quot;opposed by somebody&quot;. There are not two types of psychological practices: (1) helpful, effective &quot;good&quot; therapies and (2) controversial ones. Nearly everything in psychology is controversial.

Better to say something like:
*One of the biggest objections to reparative therapy comes from activists who claim that RT advocates are &quot;targeting teenagers&quot;. 

Also saying that something &quot;come to public attention&quot; implies that it's true (massive targetting).

Moreover, over-zealousness by some in one direction doesn't mean the direction is wrong. Were the North Vietnamese wrong about defeating the South (and kicking out the US) '''because of''' their torture of American pilots? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 19:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

''NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana, August 29, 2006 –President of the American Psychological Association, Dr. Gerald P. Koocher, broke with the APA’s long-held stance against homosexual re-orientation therapy earlier this month, saying the organization would support psychological therapy for those experiencing unwanted homosexual attractions, the National Association for the Therapy and Treatment of Homosexuality (NARTH) reported.''
 
''Speaking with NARTH President Joseph Nicolosi at the APA’s annual convention in New Orleans, Dr. Koocher stated, “APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.” Dr. Koocher emphasized that so long as patient autonomy and choice were respected, the APA’s Code of Ethics would certainly encompass psychological treatment of those who wish to be free of homosexual attraction.''
:(Source: LifeSiteNews.com, [http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2006/aug/06082905.html])

''The APA has never condemned sexual conversion therapy but has merely issued cautionary statements ... Although homosexuality was removed from the DSM-the diagnostic manual used by therapists-as a mental disorder in 1973, all editions of the DSM have always listed a disorder characterized by &quot;distress&quot; over one's sexual orientation (DSM section 302.9). Both gays and straights have a right to seek treatment when they're unhappy with their sexual orientation, and some choose to try to change that orientation. It would be absurd to assert that only heterosexuals should have that right.''

In text:
&quot;Reparative Therapy

The term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; refers to psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires and is used by people who do not think homosexuality is one variation within human sexual orientation, but rather still believe homosexuality is a mental disorder. The most important fact about &quot;reparative therapy,&quot; also sometimes known as &quot;conversion&quot; therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing '''more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals''', have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is no need for a &quot;cure.&quot;

So RT ist pseudoscience

If the APA supports it, then it's not &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (i.e., universally condemned) but merely a &quot;controversial practice&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the organization would support psychological therapy for those experiencing unwanted homosexual attractions&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::If that's the mainstream position, then the article should say so. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 19:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

I'd like to revisit this issue.  Wikipedia defines [[pseudoscience]] as &quot;any body of knowledge, methodology, belief, or practice that claims to be scientific but does not follow the scientific method.[1] Pseudosciences may appear scientific, but they do not adhere to the testability requirement of the scientific method[2] and are often in conflict with current scientific consensus.&quot;

RT seems to satisfy that definition.  It is (1) a practice that claims to be scientific, (2) criticized by the scientific community for unscientific research methodology, and is (3) in conflict with current scientific consensus.  It ''is'' testable, but so are other pseudosciences, so testability doesn't seem to be a necessary condition.  Looking to other [[Pseudoscience#Identifying_pseudoscience|defining characteristics]], it (i) makes vague claims lacking specific measurements; (ii) fails to make use of operational definitions (&quot;success&quot;); (iii) doesn't use Occam's razor (repression rather than change; issues with bisexuals); (iv) over-reliance on anecdotal evidence; (v) selective use of data; (vi) evasion of peer review/science by press conference; (vii) proponents and subjects are in tight social groups; (viii) assertion of conspiracy claims on the part of the scientific community; (ix) attacking the motives of critics (&quot;homosexual agenda&quot;, etc.).  This clearly seems to satisfy the definition, so I've made the change.

(The Koocher quote cited above was an off-the-cuff remark taken out of context and later clarified by Koocher after [[NARTH]] people jumped on the quote.  Koocher was explicit that the APA's stance on reparative therapy remains unchanged: it is unsupported by science and may be harmful.[http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060902-115257-5402r.htm]) [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 16:58, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

Horev said &quot;:The APA supports therapy to help people deal with their sexuality, not to attempt to change it.&quot; The question I would want to ask is if people can have gender re-assignment surgery (a friend of mine had this done back in the UK) - radically changing their physical appearance from that of a man to a woman (or visa versa) - why can't people chose to be heterosexual versus homosexual?  For a variety of reasons people are &quot;distressed&quot; by their sexuality and wish to be otherwise.  What is so wrong with the desire to undergo reparative therapy or some other therapy which would lessen same sex attractions.  

The reading I have done around the subject would suggest that there is a great deal of pseudoscience on both sides of the fence.  The declasification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the first place seems to have been surrounded by a good deal of politics and abuses of scientific method.  Robert Williams 06:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

* I don't think that anyone is saying that there's anything wrong with it, as you say. The opinion of the medical community is simply that attempting to change sexual orientation is (a) unnecessary, (b) usually ineffective, and (c) possibly harmful. [[User:Eaolson|eaolson]] 14:31, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Well, there are 2 reasonable citations I can see that express the view that RT is pseudoscience.  There's a chap called Ford who has stated it in a published book [http://jgford.homestead.com/], and  the Doug Haldeman ref as posted in the ref section. Considering RT is also considered to be discredited, its pretty clear the article should state that much at least. [[User:Docleaf|Docleaf]] 15:07, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

If we're complaining that RT is a pseudoscience you can't use terms like &quot;opinion,&quot; &quot;possibly harmful&quot; or &quot;considered discredited&quot; without citations to bonafide research.  If it is discredited then lets see the research that proves it to be harmful - if it is merely the &quot;opinion&quot; of the psychiatric community that RT is no good then I'm afraid that doesn't wash. I would challenge Eaolson's assertion that &quot;[no one] is saying that there's anything wrong with it&quot;.  By claiming that RT is pseudoscience you are saying there is something wrong with it - it is not based on good research and is fundamentally flawed in concept.  You are attempting to damn by association. I would assert that this is not taking an unbiased line.

There certainly do seem to be things that are scientifically &quot;wobbly&quot; about RT but it would seem that the whole subject of homosexuality, same sex attractions, and various therapies which are offered to deal with them (either in simply coming to terms with homosexuality or in attempting to change sexual orientation) is surrounded by politicisation and questionable approaches to the use of research to justify positions.  

I would rather see a less &quot;charged&quot; and more balanced tone in the article.  It would be better to keep it to the facts and there isn't enough evidence on either side of the argument to say that RT is harmful pseudoscience. Robert Williams 10:23, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:The mainstream medical view is extensively cited throughout the article.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 14:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

However, this view like some of RT is not backed up by research.  I would contend that the whole subject of homosexuality and within that RT has been politicised.  We hear that it is the opinion of the APA that attempting to change one's sexuality may be harmful - ''but not'' that having thoroughly researched the matter the APA conclude that ...  Do you see my point?  The APA cannot point to reliable unbiased scientific research to say categoricallly that RT is harmful.  NARTH on the other had cite many examples (all-be-it anecdotal) of men and women who have quite happily changed their sexual orientation using RT.    Who is one to believe?

Cut from article:

==Article title - Idea for renaming to &quot;Sexual reorientation therapy&quot;==

Should we move this to [[sexual reorientation therapy]] due to &quot;connotations&quot; of ''reparative therapy''? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 18:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:No, for a few reasons:  &quot;reparative therapy&quot; is what the techniques described in this article are most typically called.  Whether their use is &quot;reparative&quot; (or destructive) is a subject of debate between proponents and opponents of the use of these techniques.  However, whether it should even be called &quot;therapy&quot; is also a matter of dispute, since The [[American Psychiatric Association]], The [[American Psychological Association]], The [[American Counseling Association]], and The [[National Association of Social Workers]] all reject the use of &quot;reparative therapy&quot; ''(See [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel] 1999, American Psychological Association)''.  The name used for the techniques could be considered problematic, but the article title is currently an accurate reflection of what the techniques are most commonly called.  Changing the article title to [[sexual reorientation therapy]] would not be an improvement.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 19:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't know enough about Cohen or his actions to say whether that change is appropriate.  
:::Rereading what I wrote, I would like to say that I personally believe the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to be inherently POV: it assumes that homosexuality is something to be &quot;repaired&quot;, when whether or not it is is a matter of opinion.  However, it ''is'' the term most commonly used.  I am not sure what Wikipedia's responsibility is, as far as newly-invented terms.  Wikipedia does have an article on the word &quot;[[Nigger]]&quot;, although, where I come from, to even speak the word aloud is astoundingly offensive.  However, that word has a historical basis... not so with &quot;reparative therapy&quot;.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 23:12, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Reparative&quot; isn't the only POV word in &quot;reparative therapy&quot;. Wiktionary defines &quot;therapy&quot; as &quot;Treatment of disease or disability, physical or mental.&quot; Webster defines it as &quot;therapeutic treatment especially of bodily, mental, or behavioral disorder&quot;. If the article is moved, I suggest moving it to [[sexual reorientation]]. [[User:Herorev|Herorev]] 01:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

I think the term ''reparative'' has a slightly different meaning.
*Moberly saw homosexuality as a &quot;reparative drive&quot; to meet the heretofore unmet needs of the child for love and bonding and thus &quot;identification&quot; with males. 
*Nicolosi elaborates [http://www.vidahumana.org/english/family/homosex-condition.html here].
*The theoretical basis of RT is that homosexuality is a symptom of the client's &quot;drive to fulfill unmet homo-emotional needs&quot;. ([http://www.gaytostraight.org/cos-chapter2.htm Cohen)]

Whether the theoretical basis is right or wrong, there are at least three sources who roughly agree and use the term ''reparative'' in the same way.

The article will be much improved when we add to the statements of disapproval by explaining WHY the various sources disagree with RT. I'm looking for examples like:
*People do not have homo-emotional needs; therefore, the theory underpinning RT is false on its face.
*Attempts to change volunteers' [[sexual orientation]] have been shown by clinical research to be ineffective and/or harmful {cite needed}

==Coercive techniques vs. therapy for voluntary clients==

Some of the techniques used in the past to &quot;convert&quot; or &quot;cure&quot; homosexuals seem (to me, anyway) to have been '''forced''' on unwilling people. Kind of like [[clitoris amputation]] to &quot;prevent&quot; a girl growing up with adulterous tendencies. (If that link is red, try [[female circumcision]].)

Should the article on RT include the coercive techniques? Maybe the history sections can make a '''distinction''' between actions foisted upon victims, and [[counseling]] sought out by &quot;those willing to change&quot; (as Cohen puts it). &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ed Poor|contribs]]) 16:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

:That's a slippery slope.  Who could &quot;force&quot; an independent adult into therapy?  My guess is that most of the adults who enter this sort of programming are Christians who were taught from an early age that homosexuality is immoral.  In order for us to accept that a person's decision to enter the program was made absolutely, definitively without coercion, we must disregard that individual's childhood indoctrination into a particular belief system.  Not everyone will be willing to do that.  
:A more interesting distinction to make might be between those who enter the program out of religious convictions that homosexual behavior is immoral, and those who enter the program for different reasons.  Can such a distinction be made?  ''Are'' there any documented cases of people whose decision to enter the program was informed by a reason other than religious devotion?  I would be interested to know. [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 20:43, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm also interested in the ethics of this. Here's something I just googled:
*APA Ethical Principle E: Psychologists respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination. A client may very well determine that a non-GLB lifestyle is more dignified and fitting of her or his values and goals. [http://www.narth.com/docs/buxton.html]

Considering that I just revised a section of the article, maybe you'd do me the favor of checking whether I made it more neutral or (*sigh*) accidentally introduced pro-RT bias. I'm not very good on discerning whether '''my own''' writing is neutral. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 20:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

==Who says what==
*The National Association of Social Workers in its Policy Statement on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Issues: endorses policies in both the public and private sectors that ensure nondiscrimination; that are sensitive to the health and mental health needs of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people; and that promote an understanding of lesbian, gay, and bisexual cultures. Social stigmatization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people is widespread and is a primary motivating factor in leading some people to seek sexual orientation changes.11 Sexual orientation conversion therapies assume that homosexual orientation is both pathological and freely chosen. No data demonstrate that reparative or conversion therapies are effective, and in fact they may be harmful. [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html]

==Criticism and controversy==

This quote seems to sum it up:
*Supporters of reorientation try to present it as a valuable service for distressed lesbians and gay men who freely seek their services, but the therapists’ implicit acceptance of sexual orientation as the cause of distress, and the associated agreement to attempt sexual orientation change as a cure, exacerbates distress and reinforces and confirms the internalised homophobia that is in fact the root of the problem [http://www.gay.org.il/claf/docs/care1.html]

Where's the best place to put it? And should it left in the form of an anti-RT argument, or should it be broken up into its 2 parts?
#Supporters of reorientation call it a valuable service for people who freely seek their services
#Opponents say that [[internalised homophobia]] is the root of the problem:
#*Therapists implicitly accept sexual orientation as the cause of distress.
#*The agreement to attempt sexual orientation change as a cure exacerbates distress.

Science doesn't support RT, and the major organizations oppose it. Yet hundreds of people swear by it. Sounds like an interesting controversy. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 13:07, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

Oh that the curious reader of Wikipedia could find a &quot;balanced&quot; perspective on the topic of reparative therapy.  Such is not the case in the Wikipedia article, which appears to be another casualty of the pro-gay propagandist of my generation.  If one is truly secure in his or her position, he or she will not be threatened by a fair and adequate presentation of the most compelling evidence to the contrary.[[User:WarriorLeo|WarriorLeo]] 06:24, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi there 
I have never entered a discussion on Wikipedia like this before. But I came across this APA article on reversion therapy and thought it should get a mention.

I also note leading UK gay rights spokesman Peter Tacthell says he knows many gays who have gone straight. Kinsey also found many men who did the same.

So my points are twofold;-

1) The APA paper which advocates therapy for those that want it.
2) That many gay people do actually go straight without therapy.

I dont want to be rude and barge right in, but I think these facts should be considered. I will come back in a few days to see where we go from here.

Should Reorientation Therapy Be Available? -- APA Journal Article Says Yes
A 2002 article published by the American Psychological Association journal &quot;Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training&quot; defends the ethics and effectiveness of sexual reorientation therapy.
The paper is entitled &quot;Ethical Issues In Attempts To Ban Reorientation Therapies,&quot; by Mark A. Yarhouse, Psy.D. of Regent University and Warren Throckmorton, Ph.D. of Grove City College.

The article's published abstract reads as follows:

The purpose of this article is to identify the ethical issues in efforts to ban reorientation therapies. The 3 primary arguments cited in the literature in favor of such a ban are discussed: (a) homosexuality is no longer considered a mental illness, (b) those who request change do so because of internalized homophobia, and (c) sexual orientation is immutable.

The authors present three arguments in favor of providing reorientation and related services: (a) respect for the autonomy and self-determination of persons, (b) respect for valuative frameworks, creeds, and religious values regarding the moral status of same-sex behavior, and (c) service provision given the scientific evidence that efforts to change thoughts, behaviors, and feeling-based sexual orientation can be successful.

Psychotherapy: Theory/Research/Practice/Training, Vol. 39, No. 1, 66-75, Copyright 2002 by the Educational Publishing Foundation. (http://www.apa.org/journals/copyrite.html)



:What you have written sounds sensible. We only must be careful not to violate the neutrality policy of this website. 

:We must make it clear that reparative therapy is condemned by the mainstream, and that it is only a minority of professionals who endorse it. As long as we don't try to make it seem like the APA has no objections, then your idea is fine. 

:An interested, related question is '''why''' the groups voted 3 decades ago to change their position. Was the vote a '''reflection''' of scientific work? Or is the &quot;scientific position&quot; of the organization mostly the result of political lobbying? This is a significant question, because advocates point to the APA position as &quot;proof&quot; than homosexuality is normal and that therapists should '''not''' offer (or even agree) to &quot;help homosexuals transition&quot; to heterosexuality. 

:It's like the [[global warming controversy]]. One side says there's a mainstream &quot;consensus&quot; favoring the theory that most modern warming is manmade. This has the result that very few people look into the science of the matter. Even at Wikipedia, the views of Harvard and MIT scientists (and some NASA scientists) is considered &quot;opposition to the consensus&quot;. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 15:10, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

==Is RT coercive?==

Here is a quote from the article's main source (NGL Task Force):
Shidlo and Schroeder outlined the various reasons why their study participants decided to change their sexual orientation through conversion therapy. Some, who were already out of the closet prior to therapy, reported that they did not feel connected to the gay and lesbian community and sought conversion to find a group to which they felt they could belong. Participants who were not “out” prior to therapy were primarily motivated by guilt and fear based on their religious faith. A number of participants also were motivated by a desire to save their marriage and relationship with their children. Those participants who attended religious universities were coerced into treatment by the threat of expulsion. Strikingly, nearly 25 percent of conversion therapy interventions were initiated by the therapists whom study participants were already seeing after disclosing their sexual orientation.238 [http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/YouthInTheCrosshairs.pdf]

Apparently clients have various reasons for seeking RT, and less than 1/4 are prompeted by their therapists.

What have the professional societies said about the ethics of self-directed efforts to do RT? Do they condemn it even for &quot;those who want to change&quot; and go looking for a therapist to help them with this?  I'm looking for a statement like this:
*RT is bad, and we condemn any therapist who tries it '''even if his client comes to him, requesting it'''
*RT is ineffective and usually harmful, but if the client '''initiates the request''', then a therapist is not ethically bound to refuse.
*RT is usually ineffective and often harmful, but [our organization] has no other objections provided therapists do not pressure clients to do it.

*********************************
Phragellion again here;-6

1) I dont see how inclusion of this article would violate the neutrality of this entry???
2) I think it should stand on its own right as an APA article which apparently endorses freedom of choice in sexuality. You cant suggest that all RT is coercive. People must have a civil liberty to choose their own sexuality. If you want to cite cases of coercian fine, but to question to right to choose RT is not sustainable. This is the APA journal's point.
3) I think you raise some valid questions about the APA and its actions in the 1970s but I am not sure this is the right entry for them. I think it should be documented on Wikipedia but not ncessarily here.
4) Most importantly, this article seems to focus almost exclusively on ex-gays but only in relation to conversion therapy. But Kinsey found in one of his studies that 10% of American males surveyed were &quot;more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55&quot;;- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Behavior_in_the_Human_Male
UK gays rights campaigner Peter Tacthell also knows many gays who have gone straight;- http://www.petertatchell.net/gay%20gene/borngay.htm
5) So I think the conversion therapy is a bit of a red herring in the broader picture; There are obviously many ex-gays who never had any therapy, according to Kinsey and Tatchell.
6) Ed, you say you are &quot;looking for a statement like this&quot;. To me that suggests you have a preconception of what this entry should say regardless of what research you come across. Should not this APA stand on its own merits? It says people should be free to choose, so why cant you grant it any credibility? Is the APA journal not trustworthy?
7) The fact that many people change sexuality without intervention shows it can happen apparently without any harm. It does not appear to be a huge leap to believe that some of these people might benefit from a guiding hand as they are doing so???
8) Finally I dont see that the NGL Task Force is an accurate quote from this article, i cant find it there. Are the comments you supplied about the article as they are not in the article itself.

Where do we go from here?

sincerely
Phragellion

:Re: your #6, I would suggest that Ed is actually looking for clarification.

You have only addressed two points and the APA journal article I quote exists and should surely be mentioned in context of everything else. But I think the most important point I made was perhaps in points 4,5 &amp; 7.

== Getting this article to GA status ==

With the help of others, I've substantially rewritten a lot of this article over the past month.  It used to be a total mess; now I think it's clearly organized, not too redundant, very well sourced, and avoids weasel-words and soapboxing (a big problem in these types of articles).  I've also tried to avoid the &quot;Proponents say X, but critics say Y&quot; dichotomy as much as possible, to avoid [[WP:Undue weight]] problems.  The intro paragraph also provides stock language for other articles mentioning RT.

I'd like to get the article up to [[Wikipedia:Good article candidates|Good article]] status, and maybe even beyond.  Major to-do items include:

* &lt;strike&gt;Filling out techniques section, with sources&lt;/strike&gt;
* Adding more information on the impact of RT in political debate (I've recently added some introductory info on this).
* &lt;strike&gt;Writing a history section.&lt;/strike&gt; Including ''well-sourced'' information on Freud's influence on the historical development of these ideas.
[[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 17:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

Just some points I vaguely noticed:

* &lt;strike&gt;Images need to alternate (left, right, left, right).&lt;/strike&gt;
* &lt;strike&gt;References need formatting properly, see [[WP:REF]].&lt;/strike&gt;
* &lt;strike&gt;All inline citations should be after the exclamation point. If you'r eplanning to take this to FA they can get quit emoody about this.&lt;/strike&gt;
* There are very short paragraphs, only one sentence in some cases. These ideally need to be expanded, merged or deleted.

Just thought I'd mention that to give you something to work on. I'm sure this can make FA, though I'm sure you want to jump the GA hoop first! [[User:Dev920|Dev920]] (Have a nice day!) 05:17, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

I think to get it up to GA standard you'd need to remove some of the bias particularly in the opening paragraph.  It would need to fairly present the point of view of the proponents of RT like NARTH and remove emotive terms like &quot;christian right.&quot;  Quotations from groups like LGBT Taskforce need to be more clearly identified as quotations rather than part of the body of text.  

I'm glad to see work has been carried out to remove outdated techniques like avertion therapy which are irrelevant these days.  I wonder if they are even worthy of mention if the last documented cases were in 1992.  It is a life-time ago for some!  

Photographs of RTs failures are shown - but there are undoubted sucesses - these should be shown too.

The introduction is mainly saying how RT is viewed by groups like the APA and AMA, and listing its fallacies rather than talking about RT itself.  It seems to me like propaganda pushing. [[User:68.19.164.87|68.19.164.87]] 05:31, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

ECT is not used with reparative therapy (to change homosexual behaviors).  I'm leaving in a verify request tag on this statement for a couple days unless someone can find a source.  I highly doubt (HIGHLY) that this was ever used.  Remember, ECT is used as a last resort (at least in the US) to deal with severe psychiatric disorders and sends the patient into a [[seizure]], by sending electricity through the brain.  Undergoing classical conditioning (i.e. [[aversion therapy]]) by administering a shock to an individual's hands, genitals, or other body part to change behavior is '''not''' ECT (as unethical as that might be). [[User:Chupper|Chupper]] 23:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
:You're right that the old citation did not extend to include ECT (due to my own misunderstanding of what ECT is, which you've helpfully clarified).

==Passed GA==
Congratulations!  You article has been granted [[Wikipedia:Good Articles]] status.  Very nicely researched, well-written, fair, neutral tone, a particular achievement.  To reach FA status, I suggest slightly more work addressing the &quot;pro&quot; viewpoint of reparative therapists.  Though the article does not have too much POV, the movement is a large one and a little more time explaining the religous angle may actually strengthen the article. To do this, consider bringing material from external sources you've already listed at bottom into footnoted sections and shortening the external links list. But overall well-sourced, well-written, and nice handling of a delicate subject.  Well done! [[User:Montanabw|Montanabw]] 05:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

==POV==
The entire introduction to the article is nothing but why the topic is bad, fought against, disliked, unapproved, etc.  In fact, the intorduction closes with a long quote about how the entire subject is wrong and part of a grand right-wing conspiracy.
:It's well within [[Wikipedia:Undue weight|Wikipedia policy]] to label minority/fringe views as such.  The intro needs more content about what RT is, but it's not an NPOV problem.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 01:24, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
::You can hardly call the Christian right a minority view anymore than the LGBT left, and the claim that the sole reason for the ex-gay movement is to role back legal protections for LGBT is unfounded.  Christians are morally opposed to sexual relationships outside of marriage, not legal protections for the LGBT community.  I think part of the problem is how the ex-gay movement is presented.  It doesn't represent the view of the Christian right at all, or Jewish and Muslim communities for that matter.  Most people in the ex-gay movement do not teach that your orientation changes, just that you are able to deal with your attractions without having sex with your own gender.  Mainstream medical organizations do not say because you are attracted to your gender you HAVE to have sex with them.  They don't say you have to have sex with anyone.  Many people in the ex-gay movement have never had sex with their own gender, so it mostly comes down to dealing with emotions, which doesn't contradict mainstream medical organizations.  There are ex-gay organizations throughout the world with major conferences.  It isn't some fringe view.
::So one of two things needs to happen, either:
::* Reparative therapy is a fringe view that doesn't represent the view of the Christian right.  This article would then need to be reworded so it doesn't sound like all ex-gays support reparative therapy.
::* Reparative therapy is the view of the Christian right and therefore not a fringe view.  Significant work would then need to be done to acurately represent the Christian viewpoint.
::Until one of these two things occur, this article violates NPOV. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 18:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't fully understand your concerns.  Your first bullet is particularly confusing to me -- what does reparative therapy's relationship to the Christian right have to do with the percentage of ex-gays who support reparative therapy?&quot;  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 20:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
::::I guess I should separate the goals of the Christian Right from the goals of ex-gays and RT from the ex-gay movement.  Part of my confusion stems from the article itself, since the ex-gay movement redirects to RT.  Much of the article talks about how RT is pushed forward by the Christian right, but many of the priciples talked about in the article are not endorsed by either the Christian Right or the majority of ex-gays.  So I don't know if the definition of RT needs to be changed to properly reflect the mindset of ex-gays and the goals of the Christian right, or if another article needs to be written to properly characterize the ex-gay movement.
::::I also think this article violates NPOV.  Fireplace's argument was that RT was a fringe view, but according to this article it is the view of the Christian right, which cannot be called a fringe group by Wikipedia's definition.  I would just like a fair, unbiased representation to both sides of this issue.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 02:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

/\ The above section to the previous contributor's section appears to be unsigned.

I have to say that I agree with Joshuajohanson I feel very uneasy about the obvious bias in the article towards the &quot;Gay Lobby&quot; or LGBT POV.  There is little attempt to sympathetically treat the RT proponents be they Christian or not (and not all of them are Christians - though it seems to me that they are predominantyly so).  There is a clear attempt to &quot;demonise&quot; the Christian point of view (forgive the pun) with the frequent use of the term &quot;Christian Right&quot; as if being a Christian and on the Right automatically invalidates what you say.  Christians like the rest of the population are divided between those who are politically conservative or to the right and those who are more liberal and to the left.  I'm sure that there are many Christians who would not think of themselves as &quot;right-wing&quot; on a lot of topics.  Also the article largely ignores the POV of those who have been through RT and had good experiences with it and are now living &quot;straight&quot; lives.  What do they think?  I get no impression of this at all.  

In any event all this talk of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; ignores the fact that what ever our politics we all have POVs which are equally valid.  We might not like what someone else thinks but this does not make their POV less valid.  Where views are extremist then certainly we need to estew them, but reparative therapists views do not seem to me to be extreme - just not popular.  Not being popular doesn't mean that I can discount their views.  

I disagree with Fireplace when he implies that the &quot;Christian Right&quot; or &quot;Reparative Therapists'&quot; Views are &quot;minority/fringe&quot;.  The ex-gay movement may not be as big as the LGBT movement but they seem to be a lot of groups offering RT (not clear how big they are but judging from the number of organisations that offer RT there must be a few thousand at least) - possibly you could call ex-gays a minority group but it would be extremely offensive to label them as such.  Extremist of all colours have treated the views and humanity of numerous minorities in this way.  LGBT's themselves would protest strongly (and in my view rightly) at such treatment.  To imply that Christians (whether right or left) are a minority group is questionable in the extreme.  Even if we just confine ourselves to the evangelical / pentecostal / charistmatic wing of the church who are probably the most vocal in their opostion to the LGBT lifestyle they comprise a far bigger group in most Western countries than LGBTs (1-2% according to the latest Canadian survey identify themselves as Gay as oposed to approximately 12% protestant in Canada).  This is not to ignore the Catholics who comprise an even larger percentage of the population in Canada (using Canada for the sake of comparison) and are equally vocal in their opposition of the LGBT lifestyle.  Similar percentages can be quoted for many other Western countries.

I think that the assertion that ex-gay / RT / Christian POV are interchageable terms is supurious.  From the limited research I have done it would appear that most of the mainstream Christian churches are completely ignorant of the ex-gay movement and of reparative therapy and have politicised the issue in much the same way that the LGBT movement seems to have.  The LGBT movement and many Christian denominations / churches have adopted opposite ends of the spectrum and become very polarised.  

One could argue that ex-gays are persecuted by both the LGBT and straight communities. Straight people reason that &quot;once-gay-always-gay, how can this person have changed their orientation?&quot;  The LGBT community seem to treat ex-gays with similar contempt.  They deny the possbility of change even if someone stands infront of them as evidence: &quot;this person hasn't really changed willingly - they were cooerced.&quot;  As a persecuted minority they deserve respect, protection and at least an attempt to understand their POV.  This article should present much more of the POV of ex-gays and their experience of RT.  

I would argue that this article strongly violates the NPOV and am extremely surprised that it has managed to get GA status. 

I notice that some people contributing to this discussion have not signed their contributions.  
Robert Williams 09:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
:Several points.
* I'll just note that the objecting editors are new accounts, both with &lt;50 edits almost entirely focused on reparative therapy.  RT-related pages are regularly subjected to aggressive editing by &quot;new&quot; editors with an ax to grind.
* More substantively: no one is claiming that Christians are a fringe group.  The proposition, which is extensively sourced throughout the article, is that the claims made by reparative therapists and ex-gays are widely rejected by the mainstream scientific and medical communities.
* One of the editors is correct: there are many sets of beliefs by reparative therapists and ex-gays out there, and the article does not capture the full range of them nor their disagreements among themselves (there's a footnote about NARTH condemning Richard Cohen, but that's about it).  This part of the article needs to be expanded.
* I agree that the intro needs retooling to say more about the doctrine and less about listing who opposes it.  This is on my own to-do list.

::If you are not implying Christians are a fringe group, are you implying that ex-gays are a fringe group?  They do not fall under that category according to [[Wikipedia:Undue weight|Wikipedia policy]] because they have a prominent adherents.  I understand that mainstream scientific and medical communities reject claims by reparative therapists. It is superfluously repeated throughout the article.  That makes RT a pseudoscience, of which it is properly labeled.  However [[Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Wikipedia policy]] is to ''not'' take the scientific view (which this article does), but a neutral point of view, because &quot;Pseudoscience can be seen as a social phenomenon and therefore significant.&quot; Christians and ex-gays represent a significant viewpoint and should be fairly represented and &quot;proportional to the rest of the article&quot;.  If you say &quot;no one is claiming that Christians are a fringe group&quot;, then you should represent their viewpoints.  Evidences that their viewpoints are not fairly represented are as follows:
::* The only reason given for why the Christian Right supports the ex-gay movement is to &quot;roll back legal protections&quot;, which is completely unfounded in Christian literature and represents the LGBT point of view, not the Christian viewpoint.  This is repeated twice.
::* Other theories as to why some people support the ex-gay movement, such as financial and political, are all negative and largely speculative.  The reasons the groups themselves claim to be for it are not represented.
::* No major Christian group is quoted as to why they support the ex-gay movement.
::* The viewpoint of those participating in the movement is not represented at all, only science claiming they are only there because of social pressures.
::* There is no section on ex-gays, only ex-ex-gays, even though many people have claimed to be ex-gay.  This would be akin to only writing about people from AA that returned to being alcoholics.
::* There is a list of gay rights organizations and some religious organizations that oppose it, but no list of organizations that are for it.  There should be a summary about what they believe.
::* The See Also section is entirely composed of links to the opposition.
::[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 03:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Joshuajohanson makes some well considered and good points.  The article is heavily biased and as I've stated before ignores the POV of exgays themselves.  The article does make a good representation of the views of the LGBT community.  Whilst one respects this POV it isn't balanced at all.  Fireplace makes the comment &quot;It's well within Wikipedia policy to label minority/fringe views as such&quot;.  One wonders what other axes are being ground?  We need to see a lot more balance here.  I would suggest some changes but as has been pointed out I am inexperienced.  I take it anyone can make alterations to the article?  Could I suggest that the three of us start making some improvements?

:Reviewing statements made by major medical organizations I take back what I said about this article representing the scientific point of view.  The article makes it sound like no one should ever try to change their orientation or seek to diminish same-gender attractions.  From my understanding, medical organizations reject therapies that force people to change, that believe homosexuality is a mental disorder, that have bias against homosexuals, that use guilt as a mechanism, or that make unfounded claims that therapy can change one's orientation.  I see no evidence that therapies that do not make any of these claims are rejected by the science community, as this article seems to imply.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 22:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

No sock puppetry involved - at least not that I'm aware of.  This is a legitimate debate.  I freely confess to having an interest in the subject born out of personal experience.  This article is totally un-representative of modern RT - certainly as it is practiced in Australia and probably as it is practiced in many other countries including the States.  It is a contravertial subject which means that it must be handled carefully and sensitively with a proper respect for NPOV.  As I read this article I get no impression at all of the position of the RT movement only that the LGBT movement think it is horibly wrong.  The science quoted in support of both sides is shakey because it has become a political hot potato and few serious independent studies have been undertaken.  Therefore the whole matter, which boils down to the question of whether or not it is possible for a homosexually oriented person to change their orientation is still a matter of '''opionion'''.  Therefore this opionion (backed up by much anecodtal evidence) is worthy of being aired '''fairly''' especially in an encyclopedia article which is not the place to berate one section of the population over another.  

I really feel that we should place a &quot;The POV of this article is under dispute&quot; banner at the top of this article until we can come to some agreement on NPOV.  Robert Williams 01:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

As you mentioned before, I am new to this, so I am a little unfamiliar as to what can be expected.  I just want to make sure that the article is NPOV.  I still think it is POV, but we are working together to provide a solution, so I won't argue that you took the flag off.  You seem to know more sources than me.  I am doing research and finding out all that I can and am working on beefing up related articles.  My main source is personal experience, which I obviously can't write about, and does give me a little bias.  However I will argue when something outright contradicts what is happening in the ex-gay community.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 20:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==Major organizations reject reparative therapy==
In the joint statement denouncing reparative therapy for youth, they stated that '''the most important''' fact about reparative therapy was that it rejects the understanding that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.  That is the view that the whole article is combating, so I think it is very permissible to say that is why they reject reparative therapy.  They define reparative therapies as one that believes homosexuality is a mental disorder, but the fact is that this article talks about a variety of treatments to alter one's orientation or diminish same-gender attractions, many of which would not fit into reparative therapy according this definition.  We should not make it sound this council is rejecting those treatments, since they fall under a different category.  The exact statement from [http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation] is as follows:

{{cquote|The term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; refers to psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires and is used by people who do not think homosexuality is one variation within human sexual orientation, but rather still believe homosexuality is a mental disorder. The most important fact about &quot;reparative therapy,&quot; also sometimes known as &quot;conversion&quot; therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is no need for a &quot;cure.&quot;}}

Maybe we shouldn't call therapies that do not believe homosexuality is a mental disorder as reparative therapies.  In any case, it should be clear that these other therapies are not being rejected.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 21:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
:No.  The mainstream medical view does not reject reparative therapy because it views homosexuality as a mental disorder, but because it tries to change people's sexual orientation in spite of all the usual problems (lack of empirical evidence, potential for harm, etc.).  See throughout [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html],  [http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html], [http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4], [http://www.clgs.org/5/5_6_1.html].

::I am still not seeing your justification.  The fact is that they do allow physcologists to treat or refer clients to treatments that are aimed at altering sexual orientation.  That just doesn't jive with the claim that they reject it.  Your links don't help either.  This is all I gather from the links:
::* [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth] says these organizations do not support reparative therapies, with the most important fact about reparative therapy being that it rejects their understanding of homosexuality.  It does not make a statement on their support for transformational ministries and other therapies aimed at diminishing same-gender attraction that do not fall under their definition of reparative therapies.  They only say that public schools should be aware of potential risks, which they outline.  Even so, not supporting something doesn’t mean they are rejecting it.  If so, they wouldn’t allow for therapeutic treatments to alter sexual orientation at all.  Besides, this statement is aimed at how untrained faculty at schools approach kids about it.  Their advice to trained professionals dealing with adults is different.

::*[http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html Answers to Your Questions About Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality] doubts their effectiveness and again warns of potential harms as well as expressing concerns, but doesn’t reject them.  Again, it does not mention transformational ministries or other therapies aimed at diminishing same-gender attraction.

::* [http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4 ACA in the News] again limits their statements to counselors that “view same-sex attractions and behaviors as abnormal and unnatural and, therefore, in need of curing.&quot;  Still, they allow counselors to refer their clients to these therapies, giving them a list of things to watch.

::*[http://www.clgs.org/5/5_6_1.html Official Statement Concerning Homosexuality from the American Academy of Pediatrics] says therapy directed specifically at changing sexual orientation is contraindicated since it provokes guilty and anxiety.  That is one of the precautions that is listed in the APA’s techniques.  It says nothing about therapies that simply want to diminish attractions or stop homosexual behavior.  

::So yeah, there are doubts to their effectiveness, concerns about potential harm, and a lack of support for some (not all) of these therapies.  Medical organizations still allow therapists to practice or refer clients to reparative therapies, so it shouldn’t sound like an outright rejection of reparative therapies.  There are also statements saying it should be offered because of &quot;(a)respect for the autonomy and self-determination of persons, (b)respect for valuative frameworks, creeds, and religious values regarding the moral status of same-sex behavior, and (c) service provision given the scientific evidence that efforts to change thoughts, behaviors, and feeling-based sexual orientation can be successful.&quot; [http://psych.umb.edu/faculty/perez/Psych215/Yarhouse%20sex%20conversion%20tx%202002.pdf]  So don't make it sound like all statements about reparative therapy are negative.  I am not against listing out concerns, risks and the fact that these claims are not verifiable.  

::Again I reiterate that this article talks about a variety of therapies, not all of them claiming that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that they are able to change sexual orientation, which are the therapies that these statements are about.  I am against making it sound like these organizations are unsupportive of all of these therapies.  

::To summarize, the article should '''not''' imply:
::*medical organizations prohibit all forms of reparative therapy
::*statements against reparative therapy are also directed against all therapies aimed at diminshing same-sex attractions, such as transformational ministries.
::[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 00:26, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
:::With respect to the first summary point, the article does not say or imply that mainstream scientific and medical organizations &quot;prohibit&quot; any or all attempts to change sexual orientation.
:::With respect to the second summary point, the mainstream medical and scientific view is that attempts to change sexual orientation are not effective and are potentially harmful.  See [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html] (&quot;Therapy directed specifically at changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.&quot;, &quot;NASW discourages social workers from providing treatments designed to change sexual orientation or from referring practitioners or programs that claim to do so.&quot;), [http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html#cantherapychange] (&quot;Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?

::::I didn't say medical organizations don't view attempts to change orientation as ineffective and potentially harmful.  I didn't say some organization discourage it.  I only said I haven't seen anywhere were they have said “we reject treatments to alter orientation.”  Present the facts about what they said.  Nothing more.  Say American Academy of Pediatrics say it is contraindicated.  Say medical organizations told high school faculty members that they do not support it for high school students.  Don't say they reject it.  Don't say their objections to reparative therapy carry over to transformational ministries.  That is misleading.  Exercise is &quot;potentially harmful&quot;, and there are warnings on all of the exercise equipment.  It doesn't mean medical organizations reject exercise.  How can you say they reject treatments to alter orientation if they give guidelines on how to do it?  Journalists don't completely understand what is happening in medical field.  I want to see it from the medical field itself.
::::Finally, Yarhouse may be an advocate for reparative therapy, but that article was published by the APA.

All this is very well but continues to ignore the fact that there has been very little serious research into the origins and nature of homosexuality - Major organisations may reject RT but they do so on the basis of ''politics'' not research.  Show me the research that conclusively proves that homosexual orientation can't be changed and I will change my tune.  Anecdotal evidence shows that it can and some studies I have read suggest that some &quot;spontaneously&quot; change their orientation with no intervention at all.  Little of this gets documented making it very hard to study.  The truth is that nearly all research surrounding the subject is compromised in one way or another largely because the subject is so politicised.  If we are dealing with ''politics'' of sexual orientation then the views and opinions of the reparative therapists are just as valid as anyone else's and '''should be fairly represented''' in an article dealing with the subject.  

If you were to write an article on liberalism - it would be grossly unrepresentative just to talk of it in terms of a socialist response to liberalism.  You'd want to talk about differing perspectives on liberalism but this wouldn't be the main focus.  

Let's see both / all sides of this argument fairly reflected in the article.  The way it reads at the moment makes it sound as if it is seriouisly dodgy and as safe as wiring up your home with bare wires.  Now from your POV you may feel that it is about as safe as wiring your home with bare wires, but to many others (myself included) it has been a lifeline.  '''There is room for both opinions to be fairly represented within the article.'''

:I've made some changes that I think begin to address these concerns.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 16:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::Fireplace, yes I think this is definitely a step in the right direction - it needs beefing up a bit but it's a good start.  I think a critical thing is to change the opening section (this has been mentioned by others) so that it gives a more balanced introduction to the subject.  The reader needs to understand that there are two strongly held and diametrically oposed POVs on this subject and that it is controvertial.  This is the essence of the story we must tell about RT - rightly or wrongly people have taken sides in this debate but the job of an encyclopedia article is not to be partial - we must simply present the facts and allow people to decide one way or the other.  

::I did think that the third paragraph which includes mention of &quot;the Christian Right&quot; was rather extreme and perhaps a little bigoted (as I have mentioned before by no means are all Christians are right wing) - but this is obviously their view (and again needs to be fairly represented) - perhaps you could reorganise the two quotes in this paragraph so that they are more obviously quotes.  The second paragraph should be balanced with the RT view perhaps  the NARTH view of the matter.  Thank you, with this improvement and with a few other more minor ones, I think we could drop the NPOV dispute.  Perhaps we can then look at getting the article upto A class? What do others contributing on this subject think? Robert Williams 01:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I should just point out that I am Down Under and that it will take a day for me to respond to posts. Robert Williams 01:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

This article needs to distinguish position statements on all therapies to diminish homosexual attractions/behaviors and those directed at the ones that are based on the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder and that sexual orientation is reversible, like Richard Cohen and NARTH.  References to statements that orientation cannot be changed do not discredit all theories.  Statements prohibiting practicing treatments that say homosexuality is a mental disorder should not be applied to all treatments.  This article is about all treatments to alter one's orientation, including transformational ministries.  A previous version of this article reads &quot;The ethics guidelines of these organizations discourage, and sometimes prohibit, its practice.&quot;  I see nothing in the ethics guidelines that ever prohibit treatments like transformational ministries that don't work on the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder.  Instead of saying &quot;sometimes prohibits it&quot; say when it prohibits what.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 22:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

== The American Psychiatric Association's position statement ==

[http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf Here] is the position statement.  The appendix, a 1998 publication, states that the organization hasn't issued a formal position statement on reparative therapy.  The publication itself, released in 2000, is titled &quot;Therapies on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies): Position Statement.&quot;  There's been an edit controversy over whether the 2000 document constitutes a formal position statement on reparative therapy.  I don't understand why this is controversial.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 00:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
:The 2000 statement &quot;augments, rather than replaces the 1998 statement.&quot;  It &quot;expands&quot; and &quot;elaborates&quot; the previous statement.  It doesn't &quot;outdate&quot; it.  So in essense, the 1998 statement is a part of the 2000 statement.  They are very clear on that.  The 1998 statement says &quot;The American Psychiatric Association does not currently have a formal position statement on treatments that attempt to change a persons sexual orientation.&quot;  It makes lots of other positions statements, including opposition to certain therapies that are based on the fact that homosexuality is a mental disorder.  Its not void of statements.  The 2000 statements also adds additional statements and recommendations.  I didn't mean to imply it wasn't a formal statement.  It just doesn't make a statement on those treatments.  It &quot;recommends&quot; &quot;refraining&quot; from attempting to change a client's orientation, while keeping in mind to &quot;First, do no harm&quot;. Refraining? Keep in mind to do no harm?  What does that mean?  What harm?  I don't know.  Maybe it is in reference to the 1998's statement of appropriate clinical indications for attempting to change sexual behavior (maybe deeply held religious beliefs?)  Maybe the fact that there are &quot;no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of &quot;reparative&quot; treatments.&quot;  I think it is purposely ambiguous in order to avoid making a formal statement.  It doesn't undo, outdate or any way counter the 1998 statement that there is no formal statement on treatments that attempt to change a persons sexual orientation.  The 1998 statment is a valid one.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 00:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
::You're jumping through interpretative hoops to create ambiguity where there is none.  The APA makes a very clear argument: there is no reliable evidence in support of RT and, in light of anecdotal evidence of harm RT causes and the general rule not to do harm, they recommend that ethical practitioners not attempt to change people's sexual orientation.
::Even if you could argue that the APA is implicitly drawing a mysterious distinction between a &quot;position statement&quot; and a &quot;formal position statement&quot;, that distinction isn't relevant to the article itself.  Their &quot;position&quot; (whether you want to call it &quot;formal&quot; or not) is explicit. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 04:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
:::That is POV pushing.  You could just as easily say that the APA makes a very clear argument: there is no reliable evidence showing any harm caused by RT and, in light of anecdotal evidence of potential efficacy of RT and the general rule to respect the client's right to self-determination, they allow ethical practitioners to offer treatments to alter people's sexual orientation.  It is true, but that is POV pushing the other way.  This article should be NPOV.  The statement puts the evidence of both harm and efficacy on the same playing field, calling both antecdotal.  Another statement   by the APA reads &quot;the ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of therapies that seek to reduce or eliminate same-gender sexual orientation '''are under ''extensive'' debate''' in the ''professional'' literature and the popular media&quot;.[http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html]  Again, the efficacy, benefits and potential harm are all on the same field.  To the casual reader, the current article seems to imply at a first glance that the evidence supporting harm is proven and evidence supporting benefit and efficacy are disproven.  I have tried to write quotes showing the debate in professional literature, but these changes have been undone and modified so it sounds like there is no debate in professional literature.  There is a debate and the article should reflect that.

:::I quoted a segment from the position statment that said &quot;there may be appropriate clinical indications for attempting to change sexual behaviors.&quot;  Fireplace reverted it and said that it was taken out of context.  I fail to see how it was taken out of context.  How should it be interpreted?[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 19:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Responding to the first paragraph: the &quot;debate&quot; in the professional literature is limited to the one or two articles that Throckmorton and Yarhouse have published, and which have largely been ignored.  The article already discusses those articles.  The article also makes clear the mainstream medical position on reparative therapy. And to the second: A natural reading of the 1998 language ''in context'' would be to take the phrase you quoted as cautioning that the disapprobation the APA expressed toward RT in the immediately preceding sentences shouldn't be taken so broadly as to condemn ''all'' attempts at changing sexual behaviors (e.g., I imagine, sex addiction and other unhealthy sexual behaviors in same-sex contexts).  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 00:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

The NARTH website has this reference (http://www.narth.com/docs/available.html) to an APA Journal article which suggests that it would be un-ethical to with hold therapy from those requesting it.  Even within the APA camp there are differing opinions on the issue.  Attempts to have Reparative Therapy banned by the APA have, so far at least, not been sucessful.  I don't know how to reference the original journal article - if either of you can get hold of a link I'd be interested to read it.

== Extensive debate within professional literature  ==

In 1997, the American Psychological Association stated “the ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of therapies that seek to reduce or eliminate same-gender sexual orientation are under '''extensive''' debate in the professional literature and the popular media” [http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html]  In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association issued a statement that said “the issue of changing sexual orientation has become highly politicized” and that there is no scientifically rigorous outcome studies that show whether or not reparative therapy is effective.[http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf]

Yet despite the reference to extensive debate, this article claims medical consensus on the subject and that the consensus is that the ethics and efficacy are rejected, not under extensive debate as has been stated.  As evidence of the claim, the article sites [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel].  This article advises educators about the '''aggressive promotion''' of reparative therapy.  They state they “do not support '''efforts''' to change young people's sexual orientation through reparative therapy,&quot; saying that “the '''promotion''' of reparative therapy … is likely to exacerbate the risk of harassment, harm, and fear,” but say nothing of reparative therapy itself.  It is the potential for harassment resulting from the aggressive promotion of reparative therapy that educators have the duty to protect their students against, not from reparative therapy itself.  Nothing at all is said in regards to reparative therapy for adults.

Fireplace has argued against the existence of a debate, saying “the &quot;debate&quot; in the professional literature is limited to the one or two articles that Throckmorton and Yarhouse have published, and which have largely been ignored.” This is not true.  First of all, Throckmorton (past president of the American Mental Health Counselors Association) and Yarhouse are members of the APA and there work has been published in peer-reviewed journals.  Their opinions are valid, and not ignored.  Second, they are not the only ones who have argued for reparative therapy.  Here are some other people:

* Robert Perloff, PhD (previous APA president) charged that APA is &quot;too politically correct, too bureaucratic, too obeisant to special interests.&quot;  He stated that APA’s view of Conversion therapy is &quot;all wrong. First, the data are not fully in yet. Second, if the client wants a change, listen to the client. Third, you're barring research.&quot; [http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec01/aspirations.html Same office, different aspirations] 

* Nicholas A. Cummings (another previous APA president) and Rogers H. Wright, Ph.D., Litt.D., wrote a book entitled Destructive Trends in Mental Health, which argues against APA’s current favoritism towards gay groups, arguing “Such efforts are especially troubling because they abrogate the patient's right to therapist and determine therapeutic goals.” [http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=155][http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2005suppressingintelligence.pdf]

* Dr. Robert Spitzer , who was involved in the original declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder, said &quot;I'm convinced from people I have interviewed...many of them...have made substantial changes toward becoming heterosexual. I came to this study skeptical. I now claim that these changes can be sustained.&quot; (Quoted by Dr. Laura Schlessinger on her syndicated radio show, January 21, 2000.)

* Dr. Brent Scharman, former president of the Utah Psychological Association, said that all homosexual individuals should have the right to pursue change. It is the client who should determine the direction of the treatment. [http://www.narth.com/docs/scharman.html]

* Douglas Haldeman, a gay psychologist defended reparative therapy stating “this is not to say that I endorse these beliefs or share them myself; but neither do I endorse the prospect that we, as gay scholars and activists, should interefere with people's choices… For some it is easier, and less emotionally disruptive, to contemplate changing sexual orientation, than to disengage from a religious way of life that is seen as completely central to the individual's sense of self and purpose.” [http://www.drdoughaldeman.com/doc/GayRightsPatientRights.pdf Gay Rights, Patient Rights, Implications of Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy] Presented at the American Psychological Association Annual Meeting, August 7th, 2000, Washington, D.C.

* S. LeVay said “I believe that we should as far as possible, respect people's personal autonomy, even if that includes what I would call misguided desires such as the desire to change one's sexual orientation.” [http://members.aol.com/slevay/page22.html Sexual Orientation: The Science and its Social Impact]

* Ray Fowler, CEO of the American Psychological Association, states: “The APA’s position on reparative therapy is that those who wish to explore developing heterosexual feelings or behavior have a right to do so as part of every client’s right to self-determination. If an individual is comfortable with homosexuality, it is not the role of the therapist to convince the client otherwise. If one’s feelings are ego-dystonic and there is a desire to talk about changing, that is an acceptable choice and a psychologist may participate if he or she desires.” (The Utah Psychologist, Winter 1998, p. 11)

* Dr. Martin Seligman, APA president, said that he felt a client had a right to request the type of therapy that he or she wants and receive it.  He further states that those who have had fewer homosexual experiences, or who have bisexual feelings, would be most likely to successfully change and those who have had more long term, ingrained homosexual feelings and activity, would be less likely to change.  (What You Can Change And What You Can't)

All of this is in addition to Throckmorton and Yarhouse’s work.  The APA states that there is extensive debate within professional literature, and there is no evidence of a consensus of the efficacy and ethics, so I think we should represent this as a debate within the medical community.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:56, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:You can also find a handful of prominent scientists who are skeptical about evolution or global warming.  Nevertheless, a broad consensus in the medical community exists and that consensus is extensively cited throughout the article.  There may be debate (though hardly &quot;extensive&quot;) over some smaller questions (e.g., &quot;should ethics codes explicitly forbid the practice?&quot;), but on the larger scale there is broad agreement that the practice is unsupported by empirical data and that there are concerns over the ethics and motivations surrounding the practice.  It is therefore incorrect to make a sweeping statement about &quot;extensive debate&quot; over reparative therapy in the medical community.  Now, you're right insofar as the previous language (&quot;reject&quot;) was inappropriately vague.  I've replaced it with &quot;No mainstream medical organization endorses reparative therapy and many have expressed concerns over the ethics and motivations surrounding its practice.&quot; [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 03:01, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
::It is the American Psychological Association that uses the words &quot;extensive debate&quot; and the American Psychiatric Association that says it is &quot;highly politicized.&quot;  Those are not my words.  What evidence is there of a broad consensus?  It is &quot;extensively cited&quot; throughout the article by refering to Just the Facts, which was aimed at the &quot;agressive promotion&quot; (again, not my words, but theirs) of RT in the schools.  I've read &quot;recommendations&quot; to refrain, counsel that therapies directed ''specifically'' at changing orientation of ''young'' people are contraindicitive, warning not to practice RT without being trained, and an faq page stating that it is ineffective, but most say that there isn't enough evidence one way or the other.  The only consensus that I do see is that it should not be treated as a mental disorder, and it doesn't ''require'' treatment.  You wrote &quot;No mainstream medical organization endorses reparative therapy and many have expressed concerns over the ethics and motivations surrounding its practice.&quot;  I like the first part, but the ethics are still under extensive debate and I only have only seen LGTB groups complain of the motives. The article is still riddled with comments like &quot;The medical and scientific consensus is that reparative therapy is not effective,&quot; when several sources say there is no evidence whether it is effective or not.  This puts RT in a different category than evolution and global warming, because there is scientific for those debates.

::This is more than just a handful of scientists.  Don't forget that NARTH is also composed of professional scientists.  They just haven't published as much in peer-reviewed journals,  but they are still professional.  They also have notable scientists like Nicolosi.  How many scientists do you think are studying RT?  It is a sizeable enough number to get more attention in the article.  They are sizeable enough for the APA to classify it as an extensive debate.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 18:41, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

== Article length ==

On my last edit, I got a warning that the article is getting too long.  There is a lot of information in here about ex-gays and ex-gay organizations.  Though I agree that has a lot to do with reparative therapy, I think it would be better placed in the ex-gay page.  Here are some of the sections I think would be better placed on the ex-gay page:
* History and techniques practiced by ex-gay organizations, like Love in Action and Exodus.
* Ethics guidelines with respect to ex-gay groups
* Popular culture - most of it is about ex-gay organizations
*Controversies, criticisms, and scandals
:*The debate seems to be focused against the Christian right and ex-gay movement
:*Scandals involving minors (almost all seems to be about ex-gay camps)
:*Relapses and ex-ex-gays (seems to go better with ex-gays)
:*Financial motivations (the only evidence is for an ex-gay organization)
Again, I am not saying that this doesn't have anything to do with reparative therapy.  I think it should be summarized on this page with links to the appropriate section on the ex-gay page.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:29, 10 April 2007 (UTC)
:I disagree, for the reasons I've outlined at [[Talk:Ex-gay]].  In summary: (1) Reparative therapy and the ex-gay movements are inseparably intertwined phenomena, sharing many common motivations, assumptions, proponents, opponents, and criticisms -- some commentators (correctly or incorrectly) do not even distinguish between them, (2) the best way to get across the distinctions and similarities between RT and the ex-gay movement is in a section like [[Reparative therapy#Distinguishing between the reparative therapy and ex-gay movements]], (3) maintaining independent, non-heirarchical articles leads to redundancy problems (see issue (1)), (4) and an unnecessary amount of cross referencing (that gets screwed up every time you adjust the section structures), (5) the pragmatic reason that the reparative therapy article is approaching [[WP:FAC]] status, whereas the ex-gay article is an unsourced, self-contradictory mess.  Regarding article length, we're currently at 55k (including images), which is long but by no means unusual for Wikipedia articles.  Anyways, the thought is to get all the content together under a broad [[Reparative therapy and the ex-gay movement]] (or whatever) article, and then to spin off subsidiary sections into secondary articles (another common article style on Wikipedia). This is the motivating thought behind the recent [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;diff=121347581&amp;oldid=120783259 surge of edits]. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:01, 10 April 2007 (UTC)
::In response to your reasonings.
::*(1) Reparative therapy and the ex-gay movements are related, not intertwined.  We have discussed this, but here we go again.  Here are some summary points:
:::*Definition: To me, the main difference is reparative therapy is a type of therapy that may or may not be applied towards ex-gays while ex-gays are people who may or may not have had reparative therapy.  Not everyone going through RT becomes ex-gay, and not all ex-gays go through RT.
:::*Foundation: RT has psychological roots with a strong foundation in Freud.  It had been widely practiced in the secular world for years before the ex-gay movement even started.  The ex-gay movement has its roots in the bible.
:::*Methodology: RT focuses on psychoanalysis, while ex-gays focus on redemption through Christ.  Some ex-gays may use RT, but others never ever see a psychologist.
:::*Relationship to mainstream medical views: Medical organizations have put out several statements about RT, but the only one about transformational ministries is the Just the Facts pamphlet, in which a distinction is made between them and reparative therapies.
:::*Ethical guidelines:  Psychologist should obey guidelines. Ex-gay organizations are religious in nature, and so the guidelines do not apply.  That would be like saying a padre or a pastor should abide by these guidelines during confessionals.
:::*Criticisms:  Some critics against RT, such as the procedures against Alan Turing, have nothing to do with ex-gay ministries.  Likewise, some critics against ex-gay organizations, such as misrepresenting the fact that all Christians view homosexual activity as a sin, have nothing to do with RT.
::*(2) The section is helpful, but not sufficient.  It would be way too easy for a casual reader to confuse the distinctions listed above.  The current RT article does not do a good job in this distinction.
::*(3) We will have to be careful about this, but I think it would be better than confusing unrelated criticism.
::*(4) I think the ex-gay page should have one section on its relationship to reparative therapy and the RT page should have one section on its relationship to ex-gays.  We can figure something out.
::*(5) I agree, but that doesn’t mean we ignore it.  I have created a to-do list that should address these issues.
::To summarize, I still disagree that ex-gays and RT should be merged.  That will create confusion as to who is saying what to whom.  You might be right about article length, but I still stand by these other points.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:39, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

== Ethics guidelines ==

Just to be clear, here is a summary of the ethics guidelines from the major organizations:

* [[American Psychiatric Association]]: &quot;In the last four decades, &quot;reparative&quot; therapists have not produced any rigorous scientific research to substantiate their claims of cure. Until there is such research available, APA recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to first, do no harm.&quot; '''Gloss:''' At present, don't do it.

* [[American Psychological Association]]: They list a series of general ethical principles which all members should be following.  Their tone is generally negative of the practice as it happens in the real world (citing &quot;societal ignorance and prejudice&quot;, peer pressure and lack of legal protections for youth, people like Socarides treating homosexuality as a disorder), but they do not say that reparative therapy per se violates its ethics guidelines. [http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html] Elsewhere, they state that &quot;'reparative therapy,'... is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions.&quot; [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html]. '''Gloss:''' Don't do it the way it's currently done by a lot of people.

* [[American Counseling Association]]: &quot;ACA Ethics Committee strongly suggests that ethical professional counselors do not refer clients to someone who engages in conversion therapy or, if they do so, to proceed cautiously only when they are certain that the referral counselor fully informs clients of the unproven nature of the treatment and the potential risks and takes steps to minimize harm to clients.&quot;  Regarding these referrals, they state &quot;Any professional who engages in conversion therapy is not offering the professional standard of care and would need to include that he or she is offering it not as a professional counselor but is providing counseling within the scope of practice of some other profession (i.e., Christian counselor).&quot; [http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4] '''Gloss:''' Don't do it in your capacity as a professional.

* [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]: &quot;Therapy directed specifically at changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.&quot; [http://www.clgs.org/5/5_6_1.html] Note that ''contraindicated'' is a medical term to indicate a situation in which a medication or treatment should not be administered. '''Gloss:''' Don't do it to youth.

I'm writing these all down as a point of reference.  But generally, in areas that require a gloss on the ethics guidelines (such as the introduction or in related articles) I believe an accurate one is: &quot;The ethics guidelines of major mental health organizations discourage, and sometimes prohibit, reparative therapy,&quot; with a link to the Ethics section in [[reparative therapy]].  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 15:52, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:First of all, these aren't ethics guidelines, but position statements and recommendations.  Ethic codes are the rules counselors must follow, not the organizations' position on therapies.  See [http://www.apa.org/ethics/code2002.html]  Here are my counterarguments:  
:*American Psychiatric Association: That is only a recommendation.  It states to first, do no harm.  Haldeman clarifies this by saying &quot;For some it is easier, and less emotionally disruptive, to contemplate changing sexual orientation, than to disengage from a religious way of life that is seen as completely central to the individual's sense of self and purpose.”  If that is not enough, Ray Fowler, CEO, stated “The APA’s position on reparative therapy is that those who wish to explore developing heterosexual feelings or behavior have a right to do so as part of every client’s right to self-determination.&quot;  '''Gloss:''' Refrain from doing it, but respect the client's right to reparative therapy.
:*American Psychological Association:  I agree the tone is generally negative, but the fact is that they allow it and have established guidelines on how to do it.  '''Gloss:''' If you are to do it, make sure you do it the right way.
:*American Counseling Association: They state &quot;any professional engaging in conversion therapy must have received appropriate training in such a treatment modality with the requisite supervision.&quot;  That doesn't mean they can't do it.  What does mean they can't do it is the fact that there is &quot;no professional training .... that would prepare counselors to provide conversion therapy.&quot;  The objection is not reparative therapy itself or the client's right to self-determination, but simply a lack of research and training.  Note that this position is not shared by other professional organizations and is hardly a medical consensus.  '''Gloss:''' Conversion therapy is okay if the counselor is trained, the only problem is that there is no training available.
:*American Academy of Pediatrics:  Conversion therapy should not be directed specifically at changing sexual orientation.  Most reparative therapies agree with this.  Instead they work on underlying causes, such as sense of masculinity (or feminity), sense of self within one's gender, healing relationships with parents, changing homosexual behavior and lots of other techniques that aren't directed specifically at changing orientation.  Their belief is that once these issues are solved heterosexuality may come as a result.  Note that heterosexuality may not even be a goal for a client going to a reparative therapist.  '''Gloss:'''  Don't aim your conversion treatments specifically at changing sexual orientation.
:I am not arguing that there tone isn't negative, but just that it should be clear that they allow it.  I think the gloss should be &quot;Reparative therapy is discouraged by major mental health organizations, but permited under certain guidelines.&quot;  That also makes clear that it is prohibited when the guidelines aren't followed.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 17:29, 12 April 2007 (UTC)
::The ACA and AAP glosses you suggest don't convey the strong anti-RT positions explicitly made by those two organizations.  See above.  The American Psychological Association gloss you suggest assumes that the APA thinks there is a &quot;right&quot; way to do it -- and that is not the tone of the position statement.  Rather, they explicitly say that there are many ''wrong'' ways to do it, and remain silent on whether there is any appropriate way to do it.  Regarding your 'overall gloss', three of the above don't &quot;permit&quot; it &quot;under certain guidelines&quot; (APA 1, ACA, AAP) and the third regards it as unethical it under certain circumstances, without stating whether it is unethical in all cases. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 18:10, 12 April 2007 (UTC)
:::I agreed that they discouraged it, but they still permit it.  Remaining silent on whether there is any appropriate way to do it is in a sense permiting it, especially given the client's right to self-determination.  If they didn't permit it, they would have to prohibit it.  The fact is that most psychiatrists who practice reparative therapy (such as those at NARTH), do so under the licenses given out by these organizations.  If these organizations didn't permit it, how could NARTH &quot;advise its members to provide psychological care in a professional, ethical manner which is consistent with the codes of ethics of the national mental health organizations and state licensing boards.&quot;[http://www.narth.com/docs/holding.html]  It is true that Richard Cohen was suspended for violating code of conduct, but his methods were also denounced by NARTH.  The gloss you suggest doesn't reflect a psychiatrist's duty to respect a client's right to self-determination.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 18:53, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::::I agree with Fireplace.  I also would like to point out that the ACA statement doesn't necessarily mean that they believe that an appropriate treatment could ever be developed.  In light of the following statements from the ACA (''both from [http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4 here]''), I think Fireplace's interpretation is more true: 
:::::&quot;The belief that same-sex attraction and behavior is abnormal and in need of treatment is in opposition to the position taken by national mental health organizations, including ACA.&quot;
:::::&quot;To refer a client to someone who engages in conversion therapy communicates to the client that his/her same-sex attractions and behaviors are disordered and, therefore, need to be changed. This contradicts the dictates of the 2005 ACA Code of Ethics.&quot;  
::::I think that the guidelines could best be described as a form of [[risk management]].  The organizations who signed on have spoken against reparative therapy because they find it at least, ineffective and at worst, damaging.  They realize that some are still going to use the techniques, and thus it's better to lay out some guidelines than say nothing.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 20:34, 12 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::I didn't try to imply that the ACA believed appropriate treatment could be developed (it doesn't state they believe it couldn't either).  That isn't what I was arguing.  What I was arguing is the client has a right to self-determination and psychiatrists are permited to help them reach their goals.  They can do that without saying same-sex attraction is a disorder and needs to be changed.  Psychiatrists that operate under NARTH's rules practice reparative therapy without any problems from the APA, ACA, APA or AAP.
:::::As far as effectiveness, they dismiss evidence as antecdotal (together with evidence of harm) and say there is no valid research supporting efficacy.[http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf]  No proof for the effectiveness of RT doesn't equate to proof of ineffectiveness.  Neither does proof of ineffectiveness of some techniques previously employed by RT (like aversion therapy or other therapies directed specifically at changing orientation) disprove effectiveness of all techniques.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 21:16, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== The Utah Psychologist ==

I've been trying to locate an original of this source: The Utah Psychologist, Winter 1998, p. 11.  Neither google scholar nor lexisnexis turns up anything.  In the meantime, here is an unofficial copy of that page, which does not include the quote recently added to the article: [http://www.narth.com/docs/clarifications.html]. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 20:10, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::So we have two inconsistent secondary sources, and no primary source.  My guess is that the language currently in the article was a paraphrase of the ''Utah Psychologist'' piece, which itself paraphrased a telephone conversation.  It got passed around the internet a bunch of times (just google the language -- there are about 10 instances, often inter-citing) and eventually someone put quotation marks around it. Given the obscurity of ''The Utah Psychologist'' (no google scholar presence, no lexisnexis presence), I doubt Throckmorton or PFOX or any of the other people who cite it (except Brent Scharman) have seen the original.

== Malleability of Sexual Orientation ==

A critical argument in the reparative therapy debate is whether sexual orientation is fixed or not. [http://www.narth.com/docs/innate.html][http://www.ceai.org/fmembers/teaching_tips/tt_gayalliance/tt_gay_end_throckmortonfacts.pdf]  Camille Paglia, a lesbian activist, used it in her arguments supporting reparative therapy[http://lagablab.files.wordpress.com/2006/11/abante-speech.pdf]. In the opening paragraphs, it states that the medical consensus is that sexual orientation cannot be changed, but I can't find that anywhere.  Since it is such a crucial element, we need a paragraph to explain exactly what the medical view of whether sexuality is changeable.  This is a seperate argument from whether or not reparative therapies are effective, since many people think that sexual orientation changes naturally, and should not be forced.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 23:22, 14 April 2007 (UTC)
:&quot;Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? No.... [it] is not changeable.&quot; [http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html#choice], &quot;There is simply no sufficiently scientifically sound evidence that sexual orientation can be changed.&quot; (American Psychological Association) [http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/08/081106apa.htm]. If you want to add concise statement of what the mainstream position is about to what extent a person's sexuality changes outside the context of reparative therapy/ex-gay methods, that's fine -- but let's make sure it's a mainstream position.  I have no idea what Paglia's theories are or whether they are representative of the scientific consensus.  Same problem with Fritz Klein, and certainly the problem same with &quot;[[fluid sexuality]]&quot;. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 23:39, 14 April 2007 (UTC)
::I realize that American Psychological Association information page states that homosexuality is unchangeable, but others state there is no evidence one way or the other.  I was not trying to represent the idea that orientation can change as the mainstream argument, just as a legitament counter viewpoint that is held by many outside of reparative therapy.  The wording on the [[sexual orientation]] page that &quot;Most specialists follow the general conclusion of Alfred Kinsey&quot; was not my wording. I really don't care if this concept is called [[fluid sexuality]] or not, that is just what Wikipedia has been calling it.  The concept still exists.  I don't understand why this causes so much problems.  I think this is an important issue that deserves to have its own section.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 07:30, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
:::A few points.  First, wikipedia articles are not reliable sources (see [[WP:CITE]]).  Second, the fluid sexuality language you added came from a completely [[WP:OR]] article that was written in large part by you.  Third, above you argued for a statement of what the view is on whether sexual orientation changes naturally over time.  But the language you actually added to the article didn't address that: you merely put some quotes on different topics together without any clear structure. I'll also note that your [http://lagablab.files.wordpress.com/2006/11/abante-speech.pdf citation] to Paglia doesn't support your claims that she thinks orientation isn't fixed or that she supports reparative therapy.  This is a regular issue with your citations. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 15:15, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
::::Fluid sexuality isn't [[WP:OR]], and the parts I added all had references.  I only &quot;copied&quot; the parts that were references, not the other parats.  Simply being unaware of [[Fritz Klein]] and [[Camille Paglia]], isn't enough reason to revert my edits.  [[Alfred Kinsey]] also believes orientation is fluid, and Lisa M. Diamond tracts changes in attractions among women over a two year period.[http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/faculty/diamond/Publications/Sexual%20identity,%20attractions,%20and%20behavior.pdf] The paper I referenced that quoted Camille Paglia said &quot;Is the gay identity so fragile that it cannot bear the thought that some people may not wish to be gay?  Sexuality is highly fluid and reversals are theoretically possible...there is an element of choice in all behavior, sexual or otherwise.&quot;  How was I misquoting her?
::::When I try to paraphase what is said, you say I am misquoting, so lately I have been trying to get direct quotes and you say that they are strung together without any clear structure.  If you don't like my structure, fix the structure, don't just revert all my edits.
::::I must admit that some of my additions have come from NARTH, which according to you is not &quot;reliable&quot;, but the reliability should at least be that of anti-ex-gay propaganda, from which claims the APA says &quot;create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish&quot;.  Just the Facts is also horribly misquoted.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 07:30, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::Sorry -- I was wrong about Paglia and sexuality not being fixed (I missed the quote, which was in a paragraph where her name wasn't used), although the source has other problems (namely, it includes no citation and comes from a highly biased source -- a google search for the quoted language turns up no other hits; if she said this, and it's important enough to include in the article, we should cite to the primary source).  Regarding [[fluid sexuality]] and original research; yes, it was original research.  &quot;Fluid sexuality&quot; is not a category or term widely used by mental health professionals, and the article, by stringing together a series of quotes about sexuality, tried to organize them into a demarcated theory called &quot;fluid sexuality.&quot;  Regarding the reliability of sources, there is no double standard: if an organization offers a direct quote from an official statement, I tend to accept is as a reliable source (especially absent any contrary evidence); if a speaker paraphrases a telephone conversation, I am not inclined to accept that paraphrasing as a direct quote.

Funny how in the same response you say &quot;there is no double standard&quot; and a speech to the House of Representatives is unreliable because it comes &quot;from a highly biased source,&quot; while 365Gay Newscenter isn't considered biased.

== Merge and move ==
I'm proposing merging [[ex-gay]] into [[reparative therapy]], and then moving the combined article to [[Reparative therapy and the ex-gay movement]].  Over the past few months I've brought the article from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reparative_therapy&amp;oldid=104671231 a mess] to GA (and approaching FA, in my opinion) status.  This merge/move is the next logical step for the reasons below.  A little history: the articles were unmerged a month ago on an exploratory basis, and now, having lived with the unmerged articles for a while, I think they are better handled as one (but not, this time, categorizing one as a species of the other).

* From a structural point of view, maintaining independent, non-heirarchical articles leads to redundancy problems and an unnecessary amount of cross referencing (just look at [[ex-gay]]).  Not to mention, the reparative therapy article is approaching [[WP:FAC]] status, whereas the ex-gay article is a mess.  The proper way to structure these articles is in a heirarchy, with secondary spinoff articles used as necessary ala [[WP:Summary style]].
* From a substantive point of view, reparative therapy and the ex-gay movements are inseparably linked phenomena, sharing many common motivations, assumptions, proponents, opponents, and criticisms -- some commentators (correctly or incorrectly) do not even distinguish between them.  From a neutral, &quot;view from nowhere&quot; perspective, they are properly treated as two heads of the same dragon.  There '''are''' differences, but the best way to get across both the distinctions and similarities between RT and the ex-gay movement is in a section like [[Reparative therapy#Distinguishing between the reparative therapy and ex-gay movements|this]] (still under development), plus making the distinction in the article intro (like [[Reparative therapy|this]]).
* '''Support''' per reasons above. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 20:33, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

* '''Oppose''' per reasons in [[Talk:Reparative_therapy#Article_length|Article Length]].  I have since added to the ex-gay page.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 06:30, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' In light of the recent additions to [[ex-gay]], the article violates [[WP:UNDUE|Undue Weight]] and [[WP:SOAP|Wikipedia is not a soapbox]].  [[Wikipedia:Content_forking|Content forking]] is all the more reason to merge.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 04:25, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' per nom - well thought out reasons. -- &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #EECCFF;&quot;&gt;[[User:SatyrTN|SatyrTN]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt; ([[User talk:SatyrTN|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/SatyrTN|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 01:06, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' RT is a therapy or set of interventions. It is by meaning quite different from the ex gay movement. A movement is more of a political/sociological body. A therapy is a science/theology/psychology oriented set of recommendations. Length is also relevant here. Both distinct subjects require a lot of specific detail on their elements. RT is actually quite an in depth subject, that relates to psychology, social psych, spiritual ideals, and so on. Ex gay can involve RT, but RT doesn't have to involve gay (according to some views). I personally respect the view to merge, but I see that the subjects and the subject matter are so different/differentiatable that I probably wouldn't agree to the merge at any forseeable time. [[User:Docleaf|Docleaf]] 11:35, 19 April 2007 (UTC)
* '''Support''' the merge.  The two topics are barely different aspects of the same phenomenon.  Any differences can be highlighted in the new article.  In other words, Ex-Gays are, for the most part, former gays who have gone through  some type of RT is a therapy.  Linking the two in one article makes sense.  I'd like to see a more concise article as well. [[User:Lisapollison|LiPollis]] 00:37, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose'''. Consider cleaning up both articles. Ex-gay may have nothing to do with RT; treatments, ministries and scandals may not overlap. I agree with Docleaf. --[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] 16:46, 30 April 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose'''. I agree with Knulclunk. [[User:HeikoEvermann|Heiko Evermann]] 20:18, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
* '''Oppose'''. RT is only one of many methods used in the ex-day movement. In fact, RT appears to be fading out in favor of newer and more reputable theories and practices. [[User:richman9]] 11:45, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

== Definition of success ==

I added references to Haldeman who says success in reparative therapy varies between (1) eradication of attractions (2) ability to function as a heterosexual and (3) being able to refrain from homosexual activity.  It was reverted, saying it was repetitive.  The current version states &quot;Reparative therapy (also called conversion therapy and reorientation therapy) refers to methods aimed at eliminating same-sex sexual desires&quot;.  This is only one type of reparative therapy.  Please let me add the additional information so the reader can better understand all of the different types of reparative therapies.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 07:37, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
:The article also says &quot;Today... [t]here is often an emphasis on minimizing and not acting on same-sex attractions, rather than eliminating them outright&quot; and &quot;For some ex-gay groups, merely choosing not to act on one's same-sex desires counts as a &quot;success&quot; whereas reparative therapists tend to understand success in terms of actually reducing or eliminating those desires.&quot;  Also, note that in the Haldeman source, celibacy seems to fit under the ex-gay project rather than the RT project.  It's also not clear that he's saying that these are two/three different doctrinal views or whether he's merely criticizing the empirical research methodology.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 10:31, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
::Well that says what the stance of ex-gays groups are, not the goal of reparative therapy.  Haldeman doesn't mention anything about ex-gay groups.  He mentions that some religious and pastoral counselors might advocate celibacy, but they are still advocating the particular method within conversion therapy.  Just because it might be inspired by religious thought doesn't mean it isn't within RT.  Also, the religious position is different than the ex-gay movement. Not all religious people who advocate RT advocate the ex-gay movement.  This article does not reflect the differences within RT itself and the introductory sentence doesn't even cover the &quot;typical&quot; case.  Haldeman says:

::&quot;What constitutes sexual orientation change? This basic question is addressed to varying degrees in studies of conversion therapy. In some reports, the eradication of same-sex fantasies and behavior are the criteria for sexual orientation change. In other studies, the criteria are far more lenient. Typically, conversion therapists expect that patients’ homoerotic fantasies may continue but that they will be able to manage the fantasies so that they may legitimately claim a heterosexual identity, or at least function in a heterosexual relationship. Yet another option that some religious and pastoral counselors might advocate is celibacy. This option does not permit any interpersonal sexual expression at all, but it is thought of as preferable to the sin of homosexuality in some religious contexts.&quot;[http://www.drdoughaldeman.com/doc/GayRightsPatientRights.pdf][[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 16:41, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
:::You make a good argument for merging the articles. My original arguments about Haldeman stand.  Regarding the first sentence, see [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html#2] (&quot;The term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; refers to psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires&quot;), [http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html#conversiontherapies] (&quot;Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual.&quot;), [http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf] (&quot;...treatments that attempt to change a persons sexual orientation, also known as reparative or conversion therapy.&quot;).  It's perfectly appropriate to address variations on this theme within the article, and the article does this.  I think the Doctrine section would be a good place to add more, if you think it's currently unclear.  Haldeman, for the reasons I gave above, doesn't strike me as a good source though.

::::I think its ok to say that some therapists report certain anecdotal views. I also think that should be stated with respect to the majority (science) view. RT is pretty much discredited according to serious psych research. The science view really should get its airtime. [[User:Docleaf|Docleaf]] 11:39, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

== Aversion Therapy ==

Is [[aversion therapy]] a type of reparative therapy?  If so, it needs to be better explained.  It had been used for a long time before the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder.  The way it is treated right now it seems like it was never used by mainstream medical associations, which makes it seem like it was made up by ex-gay groups, when in fact they were just following a standard procedure that seemed promising at the time.  I notice in general this article tries to disassociate mainstream medical organizations from reparative therapy.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 10:25, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

==Third opinion==
This article really is in pretty good shape. I look forward to seeing it on the main page in the near future. :) This being said, its conclusions are well-sourced and appear to me to be correct. It does report on the techniques and views of the proponents, while making sure not to give undue weight to them, and properly reports that mainstream science and medicine basically consider it to be at the very least impossible and more likely actively harmful. Basically, it's a fringe theory, and is treated well in accordance with both [[WP:FRINGE]] and [[WP:NPOV]]. That should continue.

== Reaction by reparative therapists ==

It has been suggested that the section on reaction by reparative therapists was given undue weight.  I think a response from all of the accusations presented in this article is necessary.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 07:47, 29 April 2007 (UTC)
:The purpose of the article isn't to catalog the dialectic, but to provide an overview of the subject from an objective perspective.  The language you're inserting has been repeatedly removed from the [[NARTH]] article by multiple users -- it's not a clear point-by-point response, but a long series of quotes and a bibliographical references repeating what has already been said in far fewer words.  I've integrated the new info from the paragraphs into the previous version of the section.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 14:22, 29 April 2007 (UTC)
::Maybe I'd buy that if your &quot;integration&quot; actually was objective.  Your &quot;integration&quot; doesn't talk about the criticism received from scaring the pyschologists away from research, preventing NARTH from representing its point of view, or denying data pointing to the effectiveness of reparative therapy.  Also, being able to choose to enter into reparative therapy, which is where the pyschologist's '''purpose''' is to change the client's orientation, is different than the self-determination argument which is to '''allow''' the client to persue a change in orientation.  It also obscures who is saying what.  Reparative therapists aren't the only ones who think it is heavily politically based.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 00:59, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Egodystonic ==

Egodystonic is used for a variety of unwanted desires in conflict with the ego.  It gets 50,000 hits on Google (reparative therapy itself only gets a bit more with 80,000.)  It is also the technical defintion for those with an unwanted sexual orientation.  It was used in the [[DSM]] and is still used in the [[ICD]].  It might not be used much in the US, but it is used anywhere where they use the [[ICD]].[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:18, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

*I'm skeptical about this term. It gets 10 hits in PubMed, three from the 1990s, and zero since 1998. Furthermore, reparative therapy is often used on individuals against their consent. See Zachary Stark and [[Alan Turing]], for example. Therefore, reparative therapy is not exclusively used when individuals are not happy with their own sexual orientation, and the term is imprecise. [[User:Eaolson|eaolson]] 04:47, 24 May 2007 (UTC)
::That is because the APA opposes it, so most of the US also does not use it.  However, the [[ICD]] has wide usage outside of the USA.  You are right that reparative therapy is also used on other homosexuals, but that isn't the typical case.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 05:23, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

== WHO and reparative therapy ==

The WHO says in the ICD, ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}}) that those with an [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] &quot;may seek treatment in order to change it.&quot;  How is it OR to say they support reparative therapy?[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:21, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:First off, given how quickly NARTH, et al., jump over any mainstream statement that could be stretched to support their position, don't you think they would have picked up on this if the WHO actually supported RT?  Now, addressing your point directly, F66.1 says that the desire to change one's settled gender identity or sexual orientation ''is itself'' is a disorder.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 01:36, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

::Exactly!  They are disordered and can seek treatment to change their orientation (it '''NEVER''' said &quot;settled&quot;-those are your words).  Hence they can undergo reparative therapy.  My edit made clear that just having a sexual orientation wasn't a disorder, it is being [[ego-dystonic]].[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 03:34, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::No. I'll try again: F66.1 does ''not'' say that people who want to change their gender identity/sexual orientation can, under the WHO's approval, attempt treatment to change it.  It says that the desire to change (and the seeking of treatment to change) is itself a disorder.  (In other words, some [[transgender]] people and some &quot;ex-gays&quot; are disordered in virtue of wanting to change their gender/sexuality.)  The disorder to be repaired is the desire to change, not the gender/sexual orientation.  This is why some LGBT-rights people don't like this clause -- not because it supports reparative therapy (it doesn't), but because it implies that trans people have a disorder. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 14:21, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

::::I think you both are slightly off. First, I think that, as Fireplace suggests, “and may seek treatment in order to change it” is not an endorsement of treatment seeking. None of the other F66 disorders mention treatment options. (However, I have not read the entire IDC doc. Am I missing something?) Instead, the statement is probably an example of unclear writing. Replace “may” with “sometimes,” and, based on the context, you’ll probably have the correct meaning.

::::Second, I think we are having this discussion because the IDC waffles. While “Egodystonic sexual orientation” is mentioned under the header, “Psychological and behavioural disorders,” UNLIKE EVERY OTHER DISORDER LISTED, the IDC does not label “Egodystonic sexual orientation” a “disorder.” It is an “orientation.” That is a gigantic omission in this type of bureaucratic document.

::::Correctly represented, I think “Egodystonic sexual orientation” is a very big deal and should be included in the article. Perhaps a modified version Joshuajohanson’s statement:

:::::“Reparative therapy is usually used in treating [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]], which is the wish of an individual that his or her [[sexual orientation]] were different, though it has been used on [[egosyntonic]] homosexuals. The [[World Health Organization]] lists ego-dystonic sexual orientation in its [[International Classification of Diseases]].

:::::The following statement should (perhaps?) be included elsewhere: The [[American Psychological Association]] dropped homosexuality from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1987 and opposes its diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/diagnoses.html Use of Diagnoses “Homosexuality” &amp; “Ego-Dystonic Homosexuality”] August 27 &amp; 30, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; American mainstream….”

::::Finally, I have problems with Fireplace’s statement about NARTH. It is an [[argument from ignorance]] (which is logically fallacious). While he may be correct in spite of this, I think if the argument is going to stand, it needs to be sound.

::::By the way, eaolson's appeal to PubMed in the previous topic is also another [[argument from ignorance]]. For inclusion, only one reputable, NPOV source is required. That “Egodystonic” doesn’t come up frequently in PubMed only means that, for whatever reason, researches are not terribly interested or those that are interested haven’t been able to get funding.
::::[[User:LCP|LCP]] 18:01, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::Regarding my NARTH argument, it wasn't intended to be deductively valid (which, as you point out, would be incorrect).  But, the observation about NARTH, et al., is nevertheless strong evidence in favor of the conclusion.  (I don't think this matters much as we largely agree in our reading of F66.1.)

:::::I have no problem bringing up egodystonic-something in the article, but I object to giving it prominence in the lead.  As Eaolson and I have both pointed out, the term is relatively uncommon.  Under [[WP:NPOV]] and specifically [[WP:UNDUE]], the term should not be given undue weight.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 18:16, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

::::::I don’t really understand your objection to “egodystonic” or “ego-dystonic sexual orientation” (granted it is used correctly). The terms are scientific and perfectly describe the conflict reparative therapy seeks to resolve. It seems to me that that is exactly the type of thing that should be in the lead. Perhaps I am missing what is at stake? Regarding eaolson’s comment, 2/3 of his post had to do with objections against reparative therapy itself. The first 1/3 is an expression of skepticism based on an demonstrably unsound argument. Apart from being scientific, “egodystonic” comes up ~50,000 times in Google (according to Joshuajohanson). That makes it pretty darn popular, and that eliminates the UNDUE objection. “Ego-dystonic sexual orientation” is scientific, merely descriptive, and used by the IDC. Because the IDC is a MAJOR player in this arena, their use removes the UNDUE and non-NPOV objection. What am I missing?[[User:LCP|LCP]] 18:39, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::::First off, I'm hesitant to call the IDC a &quot;MAJOR player in this arena.&quot;  In theory it could have been, but in actuality there is very little mention of F66.1 in the literature, whereas the DSM-IV (which is used worldwide) is very frequently referenced in the literature.  Second, a google search for &quot;ego-dystonic&quot; is overbroad, as &quot;ego-dystonic&quot; is used in contexts outside of homosexuality or reparative therapy.  A search for ''ego-dystonic &quot;reparative therapy&quot; -wiki'' comes up with 928 hits, many of them discussing the term as it was used in the outdated DSM-III.  If we add ''-narth'' (which is not a mainstream organization) to the search, the number drops to 467.  Third, look at how the [[WP:UNDUE|mainstream]], [[WP:RS|reliable]] sources describe reparative therapy: &quot;treatments to alter sexual orientation&quot; ([http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/resolution97.html]), &quot;psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires&quot; ([http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html#2], a statement endorsed by 10 such organizations), &quot;change... clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual&quot; ([http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html#conversiontherapies]), &quot;change his/her sexual homosexual orientation&quot; ([http://www.psych.org/psych_pract/copptherapyaddendum83100.cfm]), &quot;the basic goal of reparative/conversion therapy... is to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual&quot; ([http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4]), &quot;'Reparative Therapy'...

::::::::Sorry if I am being dense, but I still do not understand what would be wrong with using the following in the lead:

::::::::The statement does not endorse RT and sounds to me like an objective statement of fact. Perhaps Joshuajohanson can help me to understand by sharing why he wants it included.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 19:12, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::::::No worries.  The problem is that the &quot;ego-dystonic&quot; language is not the standard way of describing reparative therapy, but instead relies on a term used by an outdated source (DSM-III), a (confusing) source not prominent in discussions of reparative therapy (F66.1), and fringe groups (e.g., NARTH).  The standard description of reparative therapy defines it as therapeutic attempts to change sexual orientation, as I cited above. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 19:42, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

::::::::::I don't think you should discount WHO because it is &quot;confusing&quot;, nor should it be discounted as a major player.  The [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] also uses ego-dystonic as a type of homosexuality[http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm] and has stated &quot;Treatment can include therapy meant to change a patient's orientation to heterosexual.&quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/07/world/main277027.shtml]  India classifies it as ego-dystonic.[http://www.altlawforum.org/PUBLICATIONS/PUCL%20REport%201]  The introductory section has already made it clear that the APA does not support reparative therapy.  To be NPOV it should also have that WHO has stated that homosexuals may seek treatment in order to change their sexual orientation under the diagnosis of a mental disorder.  I thought a discussion of ego-dystonic sexual orientation would make it clear that WHO does not support reparative therapy for [[egosyntonic]] homosexuals.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 23:13, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::::::::First, you still seem to be interpreting F66.1 as approving of reparative therapy.  See above.  Second, the &quot;confusing&quot; comment was directed at readability (everyone understands &quot;therapy to change sexual orientation&quot; - but &quot;therapy to cure ego-dystonic sexual orientation, which is the condition of being unsatisfied with one's sexual orientation&quot; is exceptionally unclear).  Third, sure, some people cite the ICD-10 in discussing reparative therapy.  Most discuss the DSM-IV (including the links you provided, by the way).

(unindent) The issue of how F66.1 is being interpreted aside, I don't think the second version is &quot;exceptionally unclear.&quot; However, the first version is definitely more clear. Nevertheless, I support the inclusion of &quot;ego-dystonic sexual orientation.&quot; However, so does Fireplace, just not in the lead. Joshuajohanson has evidence that it is a viable term, and putting it in the lead may be warranted. I think perhaps that someone else needs to take a look at this issue.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 23:36, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:::I am uncomfortable with this unless the whole statement is quoted without a context that implies one thing or another. That might work. Regardless, although I wish and hope it to be true that sexual orientation be subject to the will, I do not think that the WHO statement endorses treatment seeking. It merely describes treatment seeking as a behavior that might accompany the disorder. &quot;I think that, as Fireplace suggests, 'and may seek treatment in order to change it' is not an endorsement of treatment seeking. None of the other F66 disorders mention treatment options. (However, I have not read the entire IDC doc. Am I missing something?) Instead, the statement is probably an example of unclear writing. Replace ‘may’ with ‘sometimes,’ and, based on the context, you’ll probably have the correct meaning.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;ego-dystonic sexual orientation&quot; is presented uniquely, not as a &quot;disorder.&quot; So perhaps in this case, albeit doubtful (for the reason I have stated), they are recommending treatment. I think the stake-holders in this case need to look at whether the doc presents treatment options in the listings of other conditions.

::::::''If the patient is ego dystonic, then doctors have various options, including prescription of drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy and [[aversion therapy]]. This type of therapy exposes the person to visual images of the disorder he/she is dealing with, followed by a mild electric current so that the image is associated with discomfort. For example, if a person with homosexual fantasies is shown a picture of an attractive man and simultaneously administered a mild shock the frequency of the homosexual desire comes down. Prior to the prescription of treatment such as behavioral therapy, the doctors are expected to get the consent of the patient to the prescribed treatment.''

Reparative therapy is under extensive debate.  This does not represent both sides of the debate.  Even the techniques and reaction by reparative therapists sections only reference those against it.

:This kind of broad assertion of an NPOV violation isn't helpful.  The views of the major reparative therapists seem reasonably well represented in the article, as do the standard responses they make to the skepticism from the medical community.  No one is &quot;censoring&quot; anything (please AGF)-- reparative therapy is a fringe view within the medical community, and the article accurately represents it as such.

::I shouldn't have said censored.  I must admit that I allowed my comments to reflect the frustrations that I feel.  

::However, I do not agree with your assertion that it is a fringe view.  Before 1973, virtually every medical organization, including the APA, considered homosexuality an illness.  How does it go from mainstream to fringe that short of time?  There are several countries where their mainstream medical organizations use reparative therapy (like India)[http://www.infochangeindia.org/agenda4_24.jsp].  I don't think you can call countries fringe groups.  Even the Department of Defense considers homosexuality a mental disorder.[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0621-06.htm]

:::No worries re: &quot;censored.&quot;  Taking your other points one by one... that RT is currently a fringe view is reflected by the many, many citations to multiple mainstream medical organizations that have expressed negative/skeptical views towards it.  The India source doesn't support the claim that mainstream Indian medical organizations support RT -- only that some mental health professionals over there are using it.  Further, on an international level, do any these Indian professionals carry the prominence and authority of the APA, the other APA, the AMA, the WHO, etc.?  I'm not certain, but I doubt it.  Same with the Dept of Defense.  Regarding the APA position -- APA policy statements reflect their official position; articles published in APA journals do not necessarily reflect their position.  As for the ACA, their official position is explicit (see the ref in the article).  Regarding the diffs you cited, there's no evidence provided that those theories have gained much notability or widespread use or widespread discussion.  Nor have they been influential in the doctrinal development of RT.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 04:43, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

====Representation of American medical associations====
I have read the refs and I still disagree with this article's interpretation of those refs.  I cited those sources, not as official position statements, but as evidence that the article's current interpretation is flawed.  The president of the APA, Gerald P. Koocher, stated &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.&quot;  He later clarified this to say &quot;In a full, multifaceted therapeutic relationship, the therapist has every duty to respond to patient choice and to help patients achieve their goals.&quot; [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060902-115257-5402r.htm] [http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200608/CUL20060829a.html]  Even [[Wayne Besen]] states this statement only reaffirms &quot;the APA's long-standing principle that patients have the right to seek virtually any type of therapy they want, so long as the therapist explains the APA's current position and warns the patient of the potentially harmful consequences such therapy may produce.&quot;[http://www.waynebesen.com/2006/08/drunk-on-delusions.html]  The way the article stands, it makes it seems like the APA has a conflict with therapists helping patients acheive their goals.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 06:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
:You and I have been over all this before, and the current Ethics section reflects the current state of affairs.  The first Koocher quote you cite was an off-the-cuff remark that he immediately clarified after NARTH, et al., jumped all over it -- citing it in a discussion over the official APA position is disingenuous.  Further, the point of his clarification wasn't to reiterate his remarks, as your gloss suggests, but to emphasize that

:&lt;blockquote&gt;One: The therapist has an obligation to carefully explore how patients arrive at the choices they want to make. Therapists must determine whether patients understand that their motives may arise purely from the social pressures of a homophobic environment. No type or amount of individual therapy will modify societal prejudices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Two, informed consent: Patients must understand the potential consequences of any treatment, including those intended to modify sexual orientation. Patients must understand that such treatments lack a validated scientific foundation and may prove psychologically harmful.[http://wthrockmorton.blogspot.com/2006/08/apa-president-koochers-statement-about.html]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:By the way, the day before, the APA issued an official statement that
:&lt;blockquote&gt;For over three decades the consensus of the mental health community has been that homosexuality is not an illness and therefore not in need of a cure. The APA's concern about the position's espoused by the National Association of Research and Therapy of Homosexuality and so-called conversion therapy is that they are not supported by the science. There is simply no sufficiently scientifically sound evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Our further concern is that the positions espoused by NARTH and Focus on the Family create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&quot;[http://www.waynebesen.com/2006/08/drunk-on-delusions.html].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Now, yes, the APA does not prohibit practicing RT ''per se'', but they require strict compliance with its ethics guidelines and they strongly suggest that NARTH's people are not doing that.  And, that is how the article describes the state of affairs.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 12:22, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

::You claim that citing a statement by the president of the APA at the APA's annual convention in a discussion over the official APA position is disingenuous??? I am sorry, I just see ''NO'' basis for that argument.  I doubt with all the protests going on, with all the politics involved, that that statement was &quot;off-the-cuff.&quot;  Nor did Koocher counter that statement afterwards.  He did counter NARTH's assertion that the APA was changing its direction, but that is a completely different point, as is the fact that the position taken by NARTH and Focus on the Family (not all groups as the article claims) create a homophobic environment.  I am not arguing that.  Sure, Koocher said a therapist should make sure the desire to change wasn't out of societal pressures, the patient understand the risks, lack of evidence and issues.  I am not arguing that, but it doesn't change his original statment that the APA has ''no conflict'' with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.  This article takes some objections the APA has with reparative therapy and applies it to all of reparative therapy.  There are plenty of negative statements made by the APA without you making up some more.  So yes, the APA does have some objections to some of the methods used by some reparative therapists, but otherwise sees no conflict with it, nor does it interfer with the patient's right to seek virtually any type of therapy they want.

::: There's nothing I can say to the three-question-mark argument.  I think a lot of what you just said is false, for reasons given many times on this talk page, in edit summaries, and in the sources themselves.  I don't see any point in continuing a circular discussion that is largely divorced from the article content, so I won't.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:29, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

====Representation of reparative therapy====
I think the deleted edits were a heck of a lot more representative of RT than the instance where a &quot;girl was held down while staff members screamed at her until she admitted that she was hurting her family by being a lesbian&quot;, the leader who was &quot;having sex with women for the purpose of getting close to lesbians to convert them to heterosexuality&quot;, having women &quot;apologize to the men for the feminist movement&quot;, buddah therapy, the man who &quot;impulsively underwent an incomplete sex-change operation&quot;, or the account where &quot;One man slashed his genitals with a razor and poured Drano on his wounds.&quot;  Seriously, this is not typical of reparative therapy and totally misrepresents it.  How is that not POV? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 06:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

:The article mentions those in several contexts, none of which being &quot;this is how RT is practiced today.&quot;  Except for &quot;buddah therapy&quot; (which I didn't add and know nothing about), they do represent an extreme, but they are from reliable sources (mostly academic journals) and it's appropriate to talk about them as such.  Now, the examples you cited had specific reasons (given in the edit summaries) for deletion (&quot;this list wasn't in reference to psychoanalysis. anyways, nicolosi/socarides are much bigger players in the field than throckmorton&quot;, &quot;tenatively removing this paragraph... it seems like just more of the same, and from a less prominent figure&quot;, &quot;rm paragraph -- more info here is generally good, but this paragraph didn't actually describe any techniques. also, the sources are dead links&quot;). [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 12:32, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

::Reliable??? Ferber was a gay actor who went undercover to get material for a movie mocking ex-gay groups.  Can you say he is reliable?  Michael Bussee left the ex-gay movement and works to oppose it, but is given the misleading (although true) aire of authority by calling him the founder of Exodus.  Is he reliable?  Although other quotes may have been from academic journals, they are from those opposed to reparative therapy, and again I question their impartiality.  I know reasons were given for deleting every single attempt to add ''something'' about RT from reparative therapists themselves, but I disagree with those arguments.  It is fine talking about some extreme situations, but the article focuses on those extreme cases, while other treatments (for whatever reason) are removed.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]]

:::You're welcome to add information from reliable sources accurately describing current trends in RT.  This is difficult to do because reparative therapists typically operate on the boundaries of the medical profession, and reliable sources about broad trends are very hard to come by.

====Fringe Groups???====
I know India and the Department of Defense don't have the prominence of the APA, but my argument was that they weren't fringe groups (even the WHO's position is still under debate.)  In Asia, there are only 5 regions that officially do not consider homosexuality a disorder (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong and mainland China).[http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm]  Even so, China still has stated &quot;Treatment can include therapy meant to change a patient's orientation to heterosexual.&quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/07/world/main277027.shtml]  It just doesn't seem like a fringe group.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 06:03, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
:Once again, you're playing fast and loose with sources.  First, China doesn't &quot;say&quot; anything.  Rather, the person quoted in the source says &quot;Treatment can include therapy meant to change a patient's orientation to heterosexual, Chen said. He said ''such therapy is rare in China'', and he declined to discuss it in detail, saying he was not an expert in it.&quot; (emph added) [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 12:34, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
::Fine, it wasn't China that said it, but the vice president of the Chinese Psychiatric Association representing the medical community in China.  He might not be an expert on reparative therapy, but he knows enough to find out whether treatment can include treatment meant to change a patient's orientation before he goes to an interview about it.  Medical treatment of ego-dystonic homosexuality in China includes treatments meant to change a patient's orientation-end of story.  In other countries, the [[IGLHRC]] found that &quot;homosexuality remains classified as a disorder, opening the possibility of forced incarceration and forced treatment, including shock therapy and other forms of &quot;aversion therapy.&quot; That of course is the extreme case, but still exists in places like the Middle East.  Other organizations, like the WHO and Chinese Psychiatric Association classify ego-dystonic sexual orientation as a disorder and at least talk about treatment for it.  Beyond those, you still have other reparative therapists who don't even consider homosexuality of any type a disorder.  Several major religious organizations have also talked about seeking a change in orientation.  Just doesn't seem like a fringe group.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 02:12, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Unchangeable? ==

Where does it state that orientation is unchangeable?  Even the [[American Psychological Association]] only states it it is not a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed, which is different than saying it is immutable.  Both sponsored a document that stated that &quot;Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime&quot;.[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html]  Most just say there is no scientific evidence one way or another.  To say it is unchangeable is to push one POV.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 16:12, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

::I do need to do more research on the Kinsey Institute, but my question is with regard to the APA. The only place where the APA says it is not changeable is in context of whether RT works or not.  I agree the APA has statements indicating therapy cannot change orientation, but that doesn't mean orientation is unchangeable.  Clinton Anderson, director of the APA Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Concerns Office, said &quot;I don't think that anyone disagrees with the idea that people can change because we know that straight people become gays and lesbians, so it seems totally reasonable that some gay and lesbian people would become straight. The issue is not whether sexual orientation changes. We know that the issue is whether therapy changes sexual orientation, which is what many of these people claim.&quot;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Culture/Archive/200608/CUL20060815a.html]  I think there is some discongruence here between the article's take that &quot;The mainstream view is that sexual orientation is unchangeable&quot; and Anderson's take that no one disagrees with the idea that people can change.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 02:13, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Almost nothing in life is unchangable. It seems silly to suggest that something as complex as sexuality is unchangable.

I think it is most likely that people can move from one sexual orientation to another in both directions.

While we are on the topic, does it bother anyone that the main source Wikipedia is using to say '''&quot;medical and scientific consensus&quot;''' is a brief handout by the APA and GLSEN?[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html] The &quot;Just the Facts Coalition&quot; describes itself:
&lt;small&gt;

&quot;In November of 1998, a conservative political organization sponsored a conference near Columbus, Ohio with the goal of encouraging the promotion of &quot;reparative therapy&quot; programs in public schools. Staff from the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) attended this event and were disturbed at what they learned. In December of 1998, Kate Frankfurt, GLSEN's Director of Advocacy, shared the content of this initiative and the November conference with a number of national education, health and mental health organizations at a meeting in Washington, D.C.&quot;
&lt;/small&gt;

This APA consensus statement was in response to the inclusion of reparative therapy aimed at ''teens in public schools''. A very specific, targeted abuse and perhaps not representative of the movement as a whole. --[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] 01:50, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

On the other hand, we use a document that, regardless of other sources, is itself essentially only dogmatic as major warrant in several places.

== Ex-gay Identity ==

The article talks about an &quot;ex-gay identity&quot;.  I had never heard that before coming to Wikipedia.  The article cited talks about shedding a gay identity, but doesn't talk about adopting an ex-gay identity.  I must admit I am not familiar with all forms of reparative therapy, but I do know that from the several psychologists that I went to, none of them talked about adopting an ex-gay identity.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 22:20, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:While I have found warrant for &quot;ex-gay&quot; and &quot;ex-gay movement,” I have not seen any warrant for the term or idea of &quot;ex-gay identity.&quot; Apart from that, the idea itself is flawed. If reparative therapists see sexual orientation as malleable, it is hard to imagine that they would condone using “gay” as a baseline against which to define identity. Furthermore, if I woke-up tomorrow and found that, overnight, I had developed a homosexual sexual orientation, I doubt that anyone would say that I have an “ex-heterosexual identity.&quot; Unless warrant can be found, the term should be rewritten.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 23:56, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::From the source's abstract: &quot;However, within ex-gay narratives, religious discourse about homosexuality creates an inter-textual identity conflict and leads them to begin a complex process of re-naming and acquiring new discourse. Ex-gay narratives provide a significant opportunity to observe individuals using language as the primary tool to not only express identity but also create and transform it.&quot; [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 04:30, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
:::Yes, transforming identity is crucial to the ex-gay movement, but I don't think it is an &quot;ex-gay identity&quot; that they are trying to transform into.  I've learned about a masculine or feminine identity, heterosexual identity, or even more of a religious identity of being saved, born again, son or daughter of God and so on, but not an ex-gay identity.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 06:32, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
::::Based in Fireplace's text, “ex-gay identity” should not be in quotes (unless I am missing something and it actually is a direct quote). Apart from that, I think I can see why Fireplace reads the text as connotative of “ex-gay identity,” but I think that interpretation is off. “Inter-textual identity conflict” would mean that subjects feel stuck between two conflicting identities, that they are unable to self-identify as either “gay” or “ex-gay.” In contrast, as Joshuajohanson states, “ex-gay identity” has a different meaning. It means one who is already settled into an identity and that identity is as an “ex-gay.” It is one who does not have a conflict. The point of reference is “gay,” and that is not what the text is talking about. I think I have actually seen such a thing, and it is a little sad. It is like the guy who identifies himself by a missing limb. “Hi, nice to meet you. Want to see my stump?” On the other hand, there can be a positive expression of such a thing. It would appear that people are encouraged to define themselves as “cancer survivors.” Granted that, I wonder if anyone has done research into “ex-gay identity.” That would be an interesting addition to the article. Regardless, that is not what is being spoken of by the text Fireplace quotes. So, I would if it be incorrect to say, “ex-gay groups tend to focus primarily on adopting an straight identity…”?[[User:LCP|LCP]] 15:35, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:::::Several points.  First, whatever happens to the text, the word &quot;primarily&quot; should clearly go -- as far as I can tell, there isn't much homogeneity among ex-gay advocates or commentators on these sorts of issues.  Second, I don't think the &quot;straight identity&quot; language is accurate either: many ex-gays don't claim to be &quot;straight&quot; insofar as being &quot;ex-gay&quot; doesn't preclude having homosexual desires or even acting on them.  Third, I'm not at all wedded to the &quot;ex-gay identity&quot; language, although I think that is what Peebles is getting at, even without using those words.  Another source which explicitly ''does'' use the term &quot;ex-gay identity&quot; is ''Straight to Jesus'' (reviewed [http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/07/11/erzen/ here]: &quot;AA members refer to themselves as alcoholics even when they're not drinking, and, Erzen believes, &quot;ex-gay&quot; is a similar identity group, an unsettled and perilous condition rather than a firm relocation to heterosexuality. 'Recovery and relapse are built into the creation of an ex-gay identity,&quot; she writes, &quot;and sexual falls are expected. Rather than becoming heterosexual, men and women become part of a new identity group in which it is the norm to submit to temptation and return to ex-gay ministry over and over again.'&quot;).  Fourth, what I want to get at with this language is their idea that the label &quot;ex-gay&quot; is somehow on equal footing with the label &quot;gay&quot;, or that the &quot;ex-gay rights movement&quot; is somehow analogous to the gay rights movement.  For examples of this, see [http://pfox.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=9 here] (where they go so far as to call &quot;ex-gay&quot; a sexual orientation) and [http://pfox.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=6 here]).

(For example see http://www.couragerc.org/FAQs.html.)  I haven't seen any promotion of an ex-gay identity on Exodus or Evergreen International.  PFOX seems to be an anomaly.  I also disapprove of adopting a straight identity.  I think it would be more appropriate to say they focus on abandoning a gay identity.

==Use of the word &quot;relapse&quot;==
My OED does not have this as a medical term.  My Webster's has it defined as, &quot;to slide back.  The act or an instance of backsliding, worsening, or subsiding...to slip or fall back into a former or rose state...relapse into deep thought&quot;  &lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;[[user:DPeterson|DPeterson]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:DPeterson|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:53, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:&quot;relapse&quot; implies the subject is slipping back into ''negativity,'' (here, homosexuality) which is not POV. also, &quot;relapse&quot; implies the 'effects' of the therapy were more than a pretense. again, POV. ~[[[[user:kinda0|kinda]]]] 23:11, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::I think you meant &quot;not NPOV&quot;?  &quot;Relapse&quot; is frequently used to refer to a backsliding into drug or alcohol abuse; it has a negative connotation.  There are only two uses of the term in the article, which can and should be made more NPOV by making these substitutions. [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 23:22, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:::Three things: (1) kinda is using a &quot;common sense&quot; argument. Apart from being original research, it doesn't stand up to the OED--which has more authority in lexical matters than does personal, every day experience. (2) Even if we disregarded the OED, those who have undergone RT would arguably view a return to homosexual behavior as a very negative thing. (3) Disregarding #2, the OED definition proves that the term is NPOV.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 23:34, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::::The OED is not the definitive reference manual as to whether a certain word usage is always appropriate.  In this vein, it should be treated mainly as a guide, not to back the idea that a usage is inoffensive and unchallengeable.  This is particularly true as you can discuss with editors, we cannot discuss with a dictionary.
::::Particularly, the two uses do not refer to the behavior in terms of how the individuals themselves view it, it is a generalized reference.  Referring to &quot;returning to homosexual behavior&quot;, definitively, as &quot;a relapse&quot; is POV and not necessary.  We can just describe what the euphemism means and be done with it.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 23:50, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::::The American Heritage Dictionary's second definition for relapse is, &quot;To regress after partial recovery from illness.&quot; This definitely indicates its negative connotations. Also, I don't see how it is not POV to treat the patient's opinion as fact.

:::::I am not sure what to do with a dictionary war. As an English scholar, I can tell you that the OED is more authoritative than the AHD. But “mine is bigger than yours!” hardly seems like a good solution. In any case, I do not personally prefer the current wording over the wording you suggest, and I can understand why one might feel the use of “relapse” pathologizes homosexuality. However, as DPeterson points out, “relapse” is correct and concise. Furthermore, along the same lines that you argue, I could assert that “A return to homosexual behavior” sounds like a good thing and that using it, instead of the more concise and clinical “relapse,” is itself POV. To me, a change from the current wording, which is concise and correct, appears as if it would be POV driven, done primarily because it rubbed someone wrong. And that is not a good reason. If someone asked why the term was changed from the one warranted by the OED, all that could be stated in reply is that an editor (or two) felt that the original wording was POV. That is not a good argument. A good argument would demonstrate via textual proofs of equal or  greater weight than the OED, that “relapsed” is the wrong term.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 00:24, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

::::::The phrase &quot;a return to homosexual behavior&quot; holds no positive or negative connotation whatsoever.  It refers to a previous state, an interim period of contrast, and a return to that previous state.  How can you posit that it is less neutral than &quot;relapse&quot;, which refers frequently to drug and alcohol addiction, or to the return of a disease?  Relapse means &quot;you were doing well at something, and then you fell back into your old (negative) behavior&quot;.  The phrase &quot;a return to x&quot; holds no POV when compared to the word &quot;relapse&quot;.   We could substitute &quot;experienced homosexual feelings again&quot;, or some such, but &quot;relapse&quot; is totally inappropriate.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 01:23, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I can tell that you feel strongly about this, and I understand your examples, but  examples are not the same thing as an argument. You are asserting that my argument suggesting that “a return to” has positive connotations is a strawman. Unfortunately, we cannot look up the phrase. However, I do assert that it does bring to mind [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], a favorite among gay men [http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/ozspirit.htm], in which “a return” home is the best possible thing. The idea that &quot;a return&quot; is the best possible thing is arguably deeply embedded in the American psyche. Regardless, you overstate your case when you say that the “relapse” is “totally inappropriate.” The way the term is currently employed is in accord with its first-line definitions in several prominent dictionaries. Yes, it can have a negative denotation, but that is only as you move down the list. On the other hand, some definitions of the word are negative, so why not use a phrase that does not have obviously negative denotations? So far, you really have not provided a cogent reason.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 01:48, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

(un-indent) You said: ''some definitions of the word are negative, so why not use a phrase that does not have obviously negative denotations?'' There is no good reason why not; using another word or phrase is exactly what we should do. 
Getting stuck on personal psychological associations with the phrase &quot;a return to&quot; is not good.  We should seek an alternative to &quot;relapse&quot; (in whatever form) because of its negative connotations.  
The two uses of the phrase are:
:* evidence is gathered over short periods of time and there is little follow-up data to determine rates of relapse over the long-term;(Ref: Bright, C. &quot;Deconstructing Reparative Therapy: An Examination of the Processes Involved When Attempting to Change Sexual Orientation&quot;, [[Clinical Social Work Journal]], Vol. 32, No. 4, Winter 2004.)
:* a header is titled '''Relapses and ex-ex-gays'''

The second one is simple.  We can rename it '''Homosexual activity among ex-gays''' or similar.  Regarding the first, without a subscription to the CSWJ, it's harder to be perfectly accurate, but we could reasonably substitute &quot;return to x&quot;.  What does &quot;relapse&quot; mean but a &quot;return to&quot; prior behavior?  I don't really agree with the fairy tale argument, but I think we could go with something like &quot;there is little follow-up data to determine the rate at which individuals experience homosexual urges or engage in homosexual behavior following reparative therapy&quot;.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 02:27, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:I would object to &quot;Homosexual activity among ex-gays&quot; ONLY because it seems to be an oxymoron. Otherwise, I do appreciate the move away from &quot;a return&quot;. Fireplace's suggestion below is interesting (albeit verbose and little silly sounding).[[User:LCP|LCP]] 15:11, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

===Context?===
Perhaps this dilemma can be resolved by answering a question that plagues this whole article. From what perspective should this article speak? As far as I understand it as an encyclopedia article, it should be neither sympathetic nor antagonistic toward its topic. So for the sake of argument, I assert that statement is explicitly related to what one does after “reparative therapy,” the topic of the article. So even if “relapse” does objectively have negative connotations, from the perspective from which the statement is made, that is, the perspective of article, “relapse” is the most neutral and correct word.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 00:37, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

::I was the one who originally added the word &quot;Relapse&quot;, and while I agree with a couple editors that it is not ideal for POV reasons, I can't think of an alternative that captures the same meaning without the POV.  One option would be to balance out the POV with a title like ''Ex-ex-gays, &quot;relapses&quot;, and &quot;ex-gay survivors&quot;'', as &quot;ex-gay survivors&quot; is a common term amongst the anti-ex-gay advocates.

::::::As I have said, personally I do not care. However, I object to your change for the following reasons. You are misusing the dictionary and your assertion is without warrant. Just because a dictionary lists two meanings for a word does not mean that one term connotes the other. For example, “Bitch” is defined as, “1. the female of the dog or some other carnivorous mammals; 2. a lewd or immoral woman; 3. something that is extremely difficult, objectionable, or unpleasant; 4. Complaint” [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/bitch]. The second, third, and fourth meanings are not  connotations of the first. The last term is not a connotation of the second. Et cetera. It all depends on context. The current phrase is a compromise--and inferior. Furthermore, THREE editors have agreed on “Relapsed”; And, it has been demonstrated that “Relapsed” is a legitimate term according to the OED, other dictionaries, and the medical community. In spite of your assertion and feelings, there is no warrant for putting it in quotes or changing it. And if you really want to push this issue and disregard the consensus, “Relapse” is the ONLY term needed as it is technically accurate and concise.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 16:36, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

(un-indent) Your choice of an example word has not gone without notice.  The dictionary-documented association between the word &quot;relapse&quot; and addiction or disease warrants avoiding the word's use.  It's odd to assert that you do not care, then insist on reinstating it while using the etymology of a swear word as an example to justify your reasoning.  [[User:Joie de Vivre|Joie de Vivre]] 16:45, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

:Please do not try to psychoanalyze my usage. I am sorry that you were offended by my choice of example. I did not intend anything by it. Really. It is an example that came to mind (in the sense of female dog), and, at least in my mind, has nothing to do with you. I am not perfect, but I think if you look at how I behave on Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Idolatry#Do_Idolators_Really_Worship_Idols.3F], you will find that I avoid fallacious forms of argument. And an ad hominem attack would be fallacious--and useless. You will also find that I give way when I find an argument that is better than my own. This is not personal for me. It is about the principle of respecting consensus and using the best word.

:Merely repeating your assertion is not an argument. I have already demonstrated why your interpretation of the dictionary is invalid. The word &quot;bitch&quot; is not only a swear word. In fact, it is not even primarily a swear word. And even if it were primarily a swear word, unless you can demonstrate that “swear words” are subject to different rules of usage or are treated differently than “non-swear” words in the dictionary, you again have nothing but an unsupported assertion. I have provided sound and valid warrant for every assertion that I have made in this discussion. In response, you question my motives and merely re-assert your original claim.

The article is about reparative therapy, and from the perspective of reparative therapy, those who return to the gay lifestyle would be considered &quot;relapsed.&quot; I would also add that those who would consider themselves as having &quot;fallen off the wagon&quot; should be under the header &quot;relapsed.&quot; However, as I said, I do agree with your point!

(''unindent'') I still like ''Ex-ex-gays, relapses, and ex-gay survivors''.  &quot;Ex-ex-gays&quot; is pretty widely used, self-explanatory, and npov.  &quot;Relapses&quot; is slightly pov, but its meaning is crystal clear and the pov worry is balanced out by using &quot;ex-gay survivors&quot; as well.  I have no strong feelings about using scare quotes. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 14:49, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

I discovered that there was some duplication between the section we were working on (&quot;relapses&quot;/ex-ex-gays), and [[Ex-gay#People in the ex-gay movement]].  What I did was remove the duplication by forming a new section in that article and linking it here (as the sections in the lower part of that article do.

And, I am concred about the inclusion of Talley and Paulk under a header titled &quot;relapsed.&quot; Unless Talley has claimed to be an ex-gay, he really shouldn't be in the section. If he has made such a claim, that needs to be stated. Regarding Paulk, I don't think merely going into a gay bar could be counted as a relapse. Sorry to use a negative example, for I do not mean to pathologize, but a drunk needs to actually take a drink before you'd say he's fallen off the wagon. I am concered that these people are being slandered.[[User:LCP|LCP]] 17:31, 15 June 2007 (UTC)

::How many of these people actually underwent reparative therapy?  For example, according to [[Kirk Talley]]'s page, he &quot;relapsed&quot; before he underwent reparative therapy.  How can you relapse before you even leave homosexuality?  That just doesn't make sense.  There is no indication that any of the other people underwent reparative therapy.  The new additions were taken from the [[ex-gay]] page.  I agree it needs to be de-duplicated, but I think it makes more sense to put them on the ex-gay page since not all of them have undergone reparative therapy.  That is also where the people who didn't relapse are placed.  One of the reasons this is POV, is because the failures are documented and not the successes.  I think either the failures should go back to the ex-gay page or the successes should come here, preferably the former.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 17:55, 15 June 2007 (UTC)

Like Fireplace has said earlier, we have been over this, but I agree a list would be helpful.  Here are some problems with factuality and neutrality that I see.  This is just a quick list and is not meant to include everything.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 20:39, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

===Neutrality===
*This article's treatment of reparative therapy is overly broad.  It is only one method to treat sexual orientation which is based on the idea that homosexuality is a reparative drive.  This article expands the definition to include everything from prayer to aversion therapy.  It then uses statements by the APA on reparative therapy to combat all of those methods, so it sounds like even praying to change orientation is ineffective and potentially harmful.
:*Reparative therapy is not a well defined, well demarcated field.  An accurate encyclopedia article will represent the topic as fuzzy around the edges.  How would you suggest we clarify the statement of the current APA position? [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 18:45, 19 July 2007 (UTC)
*The ex-gay movement is related to reparative therapy, but it is not the same thing.  Unless it is directly related to reparative therapies, it should go on the [[ex-gay]] page.  I think a couple paragraphs explaining ex-gay relationship to reparative therapy should suffice.  Extensive documentation of ex-gay camps don't need to be here.
*The view of reparative therapists is misrepresented.  Extreme measures such as &quot;girl was held down while staff members screamed at her until she admitted that she was hurting her family by being a lesbian&quot;, the leader who was &quot;having sex with women for the purpose of getting close to lesbians to convert them to heterosexuality&quot;, having women &quot;apologize to the men for the feminist movement&quot;, the man who &quot;impulsively underwent an incomplete sex-change operation&quot;, or the account where &quot;One man slashed his genitals with a razor and poured Drano on his wounds&quot; are not typical.  Although I understand that some mention is appropriate, it should be balanced by the typical case.  However, that has been removed.

===Factuality===
*The American Psychological Association opposes practicing reparative therapy.  The president of the APA, Gerald P. Koocher, stated &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.&quot;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060902-115257-5402r.htm]  I have only seen other medical organizations recommend against it, being unsupportive of its promotion, and being concerned about the environment that NARTH's position can create, which are all different than opposing reparative therapy itself.  I would like to see the ethics guidelines explain what those guidelines actually are rather than summarizing them to be a &quot;strong stance&quot;.
:*I'm having a hard time disentangling this.  The Koocher quote, as you know, was a remark that he immediately clarified, and it is bad faith to continue to rely on it out of context.  Regarding the ethics guidelines, what specific language would you like to add or change?  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 18:45, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

*Existence of a medical consensus.  There is [[Talk:Reparative_therapy/Archive_3#Extensive_debate_within_professional_literature|extensive debate]] in the professional world.  The only consensus I see is what is written in Just the Facts, like homosexuality is not a mental illness, it is not inherently bad and they do not support the promotion of reparative therapy among young people.  Just the Facts should only be used to support what is actually in Just the Facts.  It should not be used to justify a claim to a non-existent medical consensus. For example, these claims that the medical consensus are false:
:*Sexual orientation is unchangeable  Clinton Anderson, director of the APA Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Concerns Office, said &quot;I don't think that anyone disagrees with the idea that people can change.&quot; [http://www.cnsnews.com/Culture/Archive/200608/CUL20060815a.html]The APA only says reparative therapy cannot change orientation, not that sexual orientation is unchangeable.  Others just say there is no evidence. See [[Talk:Reparative_therapy/Archive_4#Unchangeable.3F]]
:*attempts to do so are often damaging to the person's well-being.  Evidence of harm is anecdotal.  Actual position statements are carefully worded to only talk about potential harm.  There is no scientific evidence of harm whatsoever.  Again, Just the Facts is referenced, which only talks about how damaging the promotion of reparative therapy is to those who do not wish to change.
::*That language is no longer in the article. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 18:45, 19 July 2007 (UTC)
:*reparative therapy is not effective.  Some have said therapy cannot change orientation, but that isn't required for reparative therapy to be effective.  Most medical organizations say there is no evidence that it is effective, which is different than saying it is not effective.

If we say can't say that people are ex-gay, but define [[ex-gay]] to just be a &quot;term&quot; used by someone who now &quot;considers&quot; themselves to heterosexual, we shouldn't say ex-gay survivor either.

== American Psychiatric Association Update ==

This was in 6/13 APA update, distributed to all members: [[User:OsteopathicFreak|OsteopathicFreak]] 16:50, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Drescher: &quot;No good scientific evidence&quot; that sexual reorientation therapy works.   The Chicago Tribune (6/11, Hamill) reported on the &quot;religious-tinged treatment that some call conversion, sexual reorientation or reparative therapy,&quot; noting that &quot;[a]ll the major medical and mental health organizations see such therapy as potentially harmful and recommend against it. The gay and lesbian community denounces it as self-hatred. And even the most thorough studies say just a fraction of the people who enter such treatment truly change their orientation.&quot; The Tribune continued, &quot;Mainstream medical and mental health organizations say people shouldn't be calling&quot; groups promoting that therapy at all. &quot;These are faith-based models, and I'm a physician who works in evidence-based medicine, and there's no good scientific evidence that this works,&quot; stated Jack Drescher, M.D., who was chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's committee on gay, lesbian and bisexual issues until last year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;      Sex-ed lesson: Homosexuality is not a mental illness.   The Washington Post (6/12, B1, de Vise) added, &quot;Montgomery County [Md.] sex education teachers would be allowed to tell students who ask that homosexuality is not a mental illness under a last-minute change to new lessons that go to the school board today for a politically charged vote.&quot; The lessons &quot;are proposed for all eighth- and 10th-grade health classes in the fall&quot; and &quot;represent Montgomery's first countywide attempt to broach homosexuality in sex education.&quot; The Post also noted, &quot;An alliance of citizen groups opposed to the lessons on moral grounds has appealed to the Maryland State Board of Education, which is expected to rule this summer. Another segment of the community, including much of the school board's advisory committee, felt the lessons didn't offer enough information to answer student questions about homosexuality.&quot; The Washington Times (6/13, Altamirano) also covers this story.

==Citation needed==
I added cite needed tags to &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] has created a task force to revisit its policy on reparative therapy, with an official statement expected in 2008{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.  Anderson, the director of the APA’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender concerns office, said the task force may or may not rewrite the policy, and they are sure to consider religious influences{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.&lt;/Blockquote&gt;.   Is there any reference from the APS regarding the task force?  Also, if a statement is attributed to an individual, we should have a reference for that paraphrase or quote...in this instance, I think a quote would be better. &lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;[[user:DPeterson|DPeterson]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:DPeterson|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:The article itself paraphrases the statements, so we can't quote the individuals exactly, so unless we want to quote Joshua Lynsen, we should probably stick with paraphrasing it.  The article says:
:*The task force’s report, due sometime in 2008 or beyond, could offer definitive advice on gay patient therapy when released.
:*[Anderson] said the task force’s six members could let stand the existing APA policy — or they could completely rewrite it.
:*Anderson said the task force would consider religious influences.

== Ex-gay camps and ex-gays ==

I think ex-gays and ex-gay camps would better fit on the [[ex-gay]] page.  As I mentioned earlier, it is not evident that any of the ex-gays ever underwent reparative therapy, except Kirk Talley who &quot;relapsed&quot; before he underwent therapy.  If there are no objections, I am moving the section on People who &quot;relapsed&quot; and Scandals involving minors into the ex-gay page.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 03:42, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

== Back to basics ==

It might be good to go back to the beginning, and define exactly what reparative therapy is.  Is it the general heading for counseling that deals with sexual orientation, or is it a sub-type of counseling that deals with sexual orientation?  I would propose that it is much more of a defined term that points to a particular type of counseling, and doesn't have sub-types as suggested in the article.  Very few ex-gay ministries actually use the term reparative therapy, because it is such a specific term.  Instead, one might say &quot;you might benefit from some counseling.&quot;  I think that reparative therapy is a term that Joseph Nicolosi popularized, and it is his technique that would define what reparative therapy really is.  Maybe this article should be part of broader heading, such as &quot;counseling techiques dealing with homosexuality.&quot;

This sentence is little more than gossip that belongs in a tabloid newspaper and not an encyclopedia. A parent has little control over a child's adult behaviour. The fact that Socarides' son is gay, a baker or a taxi driver is not relevant to the subject matter.

First, the subject of Richard's sexuality and his relationship with his father is fairly extensively discussed in mainstream news media: there was a long article about it in the Washington post magazine (July 11, 1999), and Charles' obits in the NYT and the post discussed the issue.  Second, Richard's sexuality is relevant here insofar as Charles Socarides believed that male homosexuality was often the result of an &quot;absent, weak, detached or sadistic&quot; father.

The whole article &quot;Reparative Therapy&quot; is biased. 
The view that homosexuality is not a disease is by no means mainstream. There is no objective, statistical evidence of mainstreamity and, therefore, this implication should not be promoted in a scientific article like this one.
*Oh come on, reparative therapy is rejected by every major medical organization. If that's not &quot;non-mainstream,&quot; the term has no meaning. [[User:Eaolson|eaolson]] 23:28, 5 September 2007 (UTC)
My point is that a scientific, factual article should provide information, not opinions, especially immature, politically biased opinions not supported by scientific evidence. As for mainstream and non-mainstream, the U.S. with APA and WHO is not the whole world. The majority of organizations, medical magazines and medical professionals AROUND THE WORLD know that homosexuality is a disorder. Treatment centers are now everywhere and getting more in number and better in results. Reparative therapy works alright, and there is more and more evidence of that. And since Wikipedia interfaces the world, the authors of the article in question should not stress one opinion too much. 
It does not help gay rights, by the way. No one really believes that reparative therapy is harmful when they are thousands of ex-gays out there who are living normal hetero lives and happy about it. The article is biased, and it harms both Wikipedia's image and gay rights.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/84.237.189.78|84.237.189.78]] ([[User talk:84.237.189.78|talk]]) 15:07, 7 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Requested move==
I'm requesting moving the article to [[Conversion therapy]], which currently a redirect here.  Both terms refer to the same phenomenon.  Several reasons for the move: (1) &quot;Reparative&quot; is inherently NPOV, as it assumes that sexual orientation is something which can or should be &quot;repaired.&quot;  (2) The label &quot;reparative&quot; dates from 1983, but the practice of conversion therapy goes back to the late 1800s.  (3) Google scholar turns up 22% more hits for [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22conversion+therapy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search conversion therapy] than [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22reparative+therapy%22&amp;btnG=Search reparative therapy].

::As far as the name choice, ''conversion'' seems to be preferred among LGBT activists, yes; but most sources, even the majority of the sources cited by the article, use &quot;''reparative therapy''&quot; by a margin of 3:2.

A search of recently scholarly archives is the better index here.
:::Eaolson also points out that some religious groups favor chastity over &quot;conversion&quot; -- that's correct, and those groups would be better described as [[ex-gay]] groups, not conversion/reparative therapy groups.

::::That is what I thought.  I was pretty sure that reparative therapy was just a specific type of conversion therapy based on Elizabeth Moberly, and that the term reparative came from her theory that homosexuality was a drive to repair something that went wrong in early childhood, not that reparative therapy repairs homosexuality, and that conversion therapy began way before reparative therapy.  But then, even with the change, it seems like reparative is being used as a synonym for conversion therapy. I understand a lot of people use it as a synonym, but even so, it should be explained somewhere.

==Medical interventions: &quot;(and sometimes even continuing today)&quot;==

In section 1.1 we get a sourced list of medical therapies that were used in the twentieth century, together with the offhand parenthetical &quot;(and sometimes even continuing today)&quot;.

This seems to me an inadequate treatment of the continuing use of medical treatments for homosexuality. This is a pretty big point, and I think we need to clearly state which of these treatments continue in use, where they are used, and by whom. I notice that the lower section &quot;Actual Practice&quot; (1.3.3) mentions no medical treatments.

I think this really needs to be made clear.

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 18:46, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

:The actual practice section has two paragraphs on ex-gay groups, one paragraph on [[Richard A. Cohen]], whose practices have been criticized by several conversion therapy groups,[http://www.narth.com/docs/holding.html]  and a final paragraph on New Age techniques, which hardly seem typical.  The actual practice section does not seem to reflect what most conversion therapists actually do.  The Psychoanalysis section does not have any [[primary sources]], and focuses on the philosophy of only two of &quot;today's leading representatives&quot;, one of whom is dead.  The aversion therapy section is much more detailed, even though it seems to be largely unused in the industrialized world.   

:In general, the article seems to focus more on why its wrong than what it is.  There are several questions unanswered.  What do they think causes homosexuality?  What are the techniques to overcome it?  Who practices conversion therapy?  The article says &quot;The ethics guidelines of the mental health establishment discourage, and sometimes prohibit, its practice.&quot;  Sometimes is rather vague.  Can we more specific on when that sometimes is?  The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has stated that &quot;anecdotal reports of 'cures' are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm.&quot;  While these anecdotal claims of psychological harm have been well documented, little seems to be said of these anecdotal reports of cures.  The section on ''Evidence cited by conversion therapists and ex-gays'' only talks about why mainstream medical organizations reject the evidence without saying what the evidence actually is.  There is even a section on relapses, but no section on those who haven't relapsed.  You read this article without really knowing anything about conversion therapy except it is rejected by mainstream medical organizations.  In my opinion, a lot of work needs to be done before it reaches feature article status.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 16:32, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

:Anyway, let's discuss it.  The section is about ex-gay camps, so it seems logical that it be in the ex-gay section.  Most of the section is about the ex-gay group [[Love in Action]], which is not run by psychiatrists, and what they do shouldn't be considered conversion therapy.  I wouldn't mind a summary in this page and then a link to the main page, which would be on the ex-gay page.  While I am at it, I think the secions in ''Actual Practice'' regarding the ex-gay groups should also be moved.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 04:48, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

For convenience of review, I've placed JJ's proposed additions on [[Talk:Conversion therapy/temp| a subpage]].

Although I agree with some of JJ's criticisms of the article, I can't say I think much of his additions! For one thing, their tone is not encyclopedic -- the descriptions read like press releases for these people. They also don't really discuss the practice of therapy, and the people don't seem to be professional psychologists, much less psychiatrists -- they simply express support for the ex-gay cause.

Of course, the subject of this article is an ideologically charged one and that fact should not be avoided or minimized, but what the article is really ''missing'' is concrete discussion of present therapeutic practice - not a bunch of links to advocacy websites.

Regarding your use of categories, I'm a bit confused! You say what Love in Action does should not be considered conversion therapy. Why not? At the moment the article defines conversion therapy simply as &quot;methods aimed at changing ... people's sexual orientations&quot; which Love in Action certainly attempts to do. It ain't medicine, but then ''lots'' of things called &quot;therapy&quot; aren't.

I'm especially bewildered that you want to get the Love in Action camps out of the article when it comes to their actual attempts to change people's orientation, but at the same time you ''inserted'' a guy who apparently has a solely administrative role in LIA, just for a chance to state his allegiance to the ex-gay cause. These actions are contradictory - unless viewed as expressions of the single purpose of showing the ex-gay movement in a favorable light.

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 05:23, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:Correct.  What [[Love in Action]] does cannot be considered conversion therapy.  [[Exodus International]], of which Love in Action is a part, has made very clear in their policy statement that &quot;it is not a clinical facility and does not conduct clinical treatment of any kind,&quot;[http://exodus.to/content/view/34/118]  They do not have licenses, nor do they claim to.  To practice conversion therapy or another other type of [[psychotherapy]] you need to be licensed by a credible organization.  Mainstream medical organizations distinguish ex-gay ministries, or as they call them, transformational ministries, from reparative therapy.  They say: &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; refers to psychotherapy to eliminate individuals' sexual desires for members of their own gender. &quot;Transformational ministry&quot; refers to the use of religion to eliminate those desires.&quot; [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html]  [[Love in Action]] is run by reverends, not [[therapist]]s.  I am not saying it has nothing do with conversion therapy, but just that it has more to do with the [[ex-gay]] movement.  

:I included stories of ex-gays in the ''Evidence cited by conversion therapists and ex-gays'' section because that is the evidence psychologists point to in order to say change is possible.  If you are going to say why the evidence is not accepted, you need to first say what it is.  For example, Mark Yarhouse uses it in the article published in Summer 1998 edition ''Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training'' entitled &quot;When Clients Seek Treatment for Same-Sex Attractions: Ethical Issues in the &quot;Right to Choose&quot; Debate&quot;.  It is evidence for change, not necessarily that the change came about through conversion therapy.  That is one of the arguments against conversion therapy, that while they know change is possible, they questions whether change comes from conversion therapy.[http://www.cnsnews.com/Culture/Archive/200608/CUL20060815a.html]  I could probably do a better job on the biographies.  I just wanted something to counterbalance the ''&quot;Relapses&quot; and other scandals'' section.  By the way, Frank Worthen started Love in Action after he became straight, so it wasn't through Love in Action that he changed his orientation.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 08:11, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

::Well, if we're going to say that conversion therapy means only ''clinical'' conversion therapy, then we would need to change the lead, which at the moment lists prayer and religious counseling among the therapy's forms.

::But I don't necessarily agree that we should limit the definition in this way. The word &quot;therapy&quot; in normal use encompasses both formal psychiatric treatment by M.D.s and also informal counseling or other treatment by people with very obscure qualifications (e.g. &quot;I'm a licensed [[Reiki]] therapist! Just look at my shiny certificate!&quot;). Since even the M.D.s among conversion therapy advocates are acting outside the professional standards of their discipline, it seems pointless to me to use a &quot;clinical psychiatrists only&quot; definition of therapy here - we would be talking about a creature that doesn't exist! 

::[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 08:47, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:::M.D.s that advocate conversion therapy are '''NOT''' acting outside the professional standards of their discipline.  They must be licensed by the APA.  This article clearly states the APA's &quot;ethics guidelines do not explicitly prohibit it.&quot;  If they were working outside the APA's standards, they would get their licenses revoked.  Here are the standards the APA has issued in regards to conversion therapy.[http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html]  In fact, the president of the APA, Gerald P. Koocher, has stated &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.&quot;[http://wthrockmorton.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html]  Ex-gay ministries differ because they do not have to follow any APA standards.  It might be considered &quot;religiously mediated&quot; therapy, but where do you draw the line?  I'm fine with changing the lead, because I really don't want to consider every prayer to be changed as a form of conversion therapy.  Anyway, the point is that ex-gay camps have ''more'' to do with ex-gays than conversion therapy, not that they don't have anything to do with conversion therapy.

Just to comment on one aspect of the above discussion: attempts to define 'conversion therapy' beyond something very general like &quot;an attempt to treat homosexuality through therapy&quot; will be too narrow to capture the range of what is out there.  There is no requirement that the practitioner be licensed - &quot;[[therapy]]&quot; can be practiced by just about anyone.  I tend to agree that Love in Action is ''more'' aligned with ex-gay groups than conversion therapy, but insofar as they use group therapy and talk therapy to treat homosexuality, it is appropriate to discuss them here (note that the NYT specifically describes Love in Action's methodology as conversion therapy [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E4DA1E3DF934A25754C0A9639C8B63]).

==Behavior modification in practice?==
We list three broad types of therapy: (1) Behavior modification, (2) Psychoanalysis, and (3) Religion. But only types 2 and 3 get a description!

Again, more detail on what these folks actually do is what the article needs most of all.

Also, and this is a minor point, but an aspect of the need for more concrete detail on practices -- what the heck is &quot;buddha therapy&quot;? Both WP and Google lead me nowhere. Does the article in ''Contemporary Sexuality'' give a description?

To answer Dybryd's original question: behavior modification is discussed (glossed over really, but I think it's enough for a general encyclopedia article) in the last paragraph of the &quot;Freud and early sexologists&quot; section, and in a couple paragraphs in the &quot;Entrenchment&quot; section.

Regarding the extent to which behavior modification is used today, I agree that should be sourced.  There are examples in other countries and examples from the US in the 1990s -- I'll look this up.  Also, note that &quot;behavior modification&quot; is much broader than &quot;aversion therapy&quot; -- but you're right that the &quot;harsh&quot; examples come from aversion therapy.

==Section tweaks==
Well, I've been a bit of a hypocrite in making minor changes to the article's heading structure without discussing them here. But I think they make this very long article read a little more clearly. Basically, I've split &quot;History, doctrines, and techniques&quot; into &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Contemporary theories and techniques.&quot; It's the latter that I think needs attention and expansion.

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 06:09, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:Yeah, I guess you're right.  In researching this material, I found it impossible to conceptualize &quot;contemporary&quot; doctrine as distinct from &quot;historical&quot; doctrine -- there's no cutoff point, and the current psychoanalytic theories stretch way, way back in time (unlike non-psychoanalytic theories, which historically tend to die out within a generation).  But alas, encyclopedias sometimes need to simplify a complicated narrative for the sake of presentation.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:46, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

==Therapy vs Ex-gays: OR/POV?==
I recognize that the precise distinction between conversion therapy and the ex-gay movement is a ambiguity that makes it difficult to write clearly about this subject. However, it's an ambiguity that I think the article in its present state goes a little too far in trying to resolve.

In the first paragraph, the sentence distinguishing therapy from the ex-gay movement is sourced to the [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html APA Online pamphlet]. That pamphlet never uses the term ex-gay! The same inapplicable source is given in the section [[Conversion_therapy#Distinguishing_between_conversion_therapy_and_ex-gays| Distinguishing between conversion therapy and ex-gays]]. This section does contain other sources, but none for the distinction that it tries to draw between the two movements - that is essentially a judgment by the editors of the article, and as such it's [[OR]] and/or [[POV]].

In general, I don't think we need this section (or the comment in the lead), and I feel this very long article would be improved if it were simply cut. If other editors feel it really ''must'' be kept, then we're going to need sources for the distinction that actually mention both the terms we say they define!

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 08:20, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:What would you suggest?  In general, I think the article leans very heavily on ex-gays instead of conversion therapy.  If it is going to do that, it should say why it is talking about ex-gays instead of conversion therapy.  It does have sections saying some ex-gay organizations consider reparative therapy a useful tool.  Maybe that is sufficient? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 08:27, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

:Well, the APA pamphlet talks about &quot;transformational ministries&quot;, which is roughly synonymous for &quot;ex-gay organization&quot;, at least as the terms are commonly used.  Another good source which loosely distinguishes them is Yoshino's excellent [[Yale Law Journal]] article (see ref in article) which says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In part because of this trend in the mental health profession, the most high-profile contemporary purveyors of conversion therapy tend to be religious organizations. These include fundamentalist Christian groups such as Homosexuals Anonymous, Metanoia Ministries, Love in Action, Exodus International, and EXIT of Melodyland.... these organizations are relatively insulated from the depathologization of homosexuality, as they are less reliant on a literal disease model to justify their conversion practices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:We could cite that article here along with the APA fact sheet.[[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:52, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

== Conversion therapy vs Reparative therapy ==

I mentioned this before, but I wanted to mention it once more under a separate heading.  According to my understanding, reparative therapy is only a certain type of conversion therapy, which is based on Elizabeth's theory that homosexuality is a reparative drive and practiced by those who believe homosexuality is a mental disorder and they try to ''eliminate'' homosexual desires.[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html]   Whereas conversion therapy is more general, including reparative therapy, but also including aversion therapy, gender wholeness therapy, context specific therapy, religiously mediated approaches and other techniques that do not necessarily believe homosexuality is a mental disorder or may only try to reduce homosexual desires and increase heterosexual desires rather than eliminate them.

So to address this, I wanted to reorganize the theories and techniques section into the different types of conversion therapies, and change the introduction from saying conversion therapy is the same thing as reparative therapy to say that reparative therapy is a type of conversion therapy, but at times the two terms may be synonymously.[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=183][[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 16:38, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

: Well, we do have the info about the origin and meaning of &quot;reparative&quot; already. The &quot;theories and techniques&quot; section is the one that needs most work, so go ahead and try out a rewrite (in Talk if it's substantial), but I'm not sure we need this detail in the lead - which is already a bit long. The terms are so widely used interchangeably (a few days ago we were arguing about which is the more general term!) that I'm not sure the distinction is important enough in modern practice to justify that level of detail in what's meant to be a general overview of the topic.

The APA source wasn't distinguishing &quot;reparative&quot; from other types of conversion therapy.  The sentence distinguishing the two would, I think, be more appropriate in the paragraph on Moberly.  Finally, Nicolosi and Socarides' views are, first and foremost, psychoanalytic theories, not Moberly-based theories. (2) evergreeninternational.com and peoplecanchange.com are not reliable sources.  I've replaced the text there with a lengthier quote from the Regent law review.  (3) genderwholeness.com is not a reliable source.  I've added a lengthier quote from the NYT article.

I also don't see any reference to &quot;Context Specific Therapy&quot; or Jeff Robinson at the other source you gave ([http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=183]), but apologies if I missed something.  Pending reliable sources, I removed that paragraph.  (5) I'm not comfortable with the &quot;Professional vs. Non-Professional&quot; dichotomy you've created.  (6) I removed the 1994 conference -- ex-gay conferences and ex-ex-gay conferences happen with some regularity.  Maybe there should be a sentence saying as much (but maybe on the [[ex-gay]] page).  (7) I removed the stuff about new age therapies.  Having read a lot of the literature on conversion therapy, this stuff is *very* rarely mentioned, and it doesn't strike me as notable enough for this article.

:::::1) The [[Presbyterian Church]] is not an ex-gay group; they aren't even united on whether they accept homosexual behavior.  There is a huge difference between an organized religion and an ex-gay group.  Ex-gay and ex-ex-gay groups have conferences all the time, but the religious techniques section is talking about how organized religions deal with homosexuality.  Yes they are related, but they are very distinct and the way they tackle homosexuality is very distinct and they should be in separate sections.  For example, ex-communication is something that only a church can do, not an ex-gay group.  BTW, why did you take that out?  Several ex-gays have said that was an instrumental part of their process.  For example, Ben Newman said &quot;Excommunication was part of a life-transforming process that saved my life, saved my family, and saved my soul.&quot;[http://evergreeninternational.org/Ben_Newman.htm]

I do not understand your logic at all.  I think this article NEEDS more primary sources.

Also, see Beckstead, &quot;Cures versus choices: Agendas in sexual reorientation therapy&quot; (2001), Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy, which describes Evergreen as a group advocating conversion therapy.  The problem with using these self-published sources is that we have no idea whether these treatments are actually used or accepted by the community with any regularity, or whether they are merely a banged-out theory that someone from the group uploaded to the website.

:::::::It's making the claim about itself, so it would be more along the lines of [[WP:SELFPUB]].  It is from the official web site for the organizations, not just &quot;someone from the group&quot;.  The purpose of the web page is set forth policies.  I could see Evergreen advocating conversion therapy back in 2001, but a lot has changed since then, especially this year.  The statement &quot;therapy will likely not be a cure&quot; is new, but it is what they currently believe and teach.  It is perfectly logical that they would change positions in 6 years and perfectly acceptable by [[WP:SELFPUB]] to publish its change of policy on its own website.

:::::3) Under the definition that the APA gave of reparative therapy, gender-affirmation therapy does not fall under that category.  That distinction should be clear.  The APA is a reliable source.

::::::None of the three citations you gave back up the claim that &quot;gender-affirmative therapy&quot; does not regard homosexuality as a mental disorder.  But more importantly, while the APA defines reparative/conversion therapy as presupposing that homosexuality is a mental disorder, others more broadly define it as any therapy attempting to change sexual orientation (e.g., ACA, AAP, Yoshino, Haldeman, Bright -- see cites in article).  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 00:03, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

:::::::But the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, The Interfaith Alliance, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association still define it as presupposing that homosexuality is a mental disorder.  Different people define it different ways.  My citations were more to show that these treatments were not reparative therapies.  The main thing I want to show in this article is that the statement by the  in no way applies to these therapies.  Those statements were very clear they were directed at reparative therapies, which they define as presupposing that homosexuality is a mental disorder.  To my knowledge, nothing any professional organization had ever put out has made any statements on any of those three therapies.  I want to make sure that the statements by the medical organizations are only applied to the treatments to which they should be applied to.  Right now, the article muddies up the differences. How would you suggest making that clear?[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 01:22, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

::::::::You write: ''To my knowledge, nothing any professional organization had ever put out has made any statements on any of those three therapies [which (purportedly) do not presuppose that homosexuality is a mental disorder].'''  &quot;The validity, efficacy and ethics of clinical attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation have been challenged. To date, there are no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of &quot;reparative&quot; treatments.&quot; (APA) &quot;Therapy directed specifically at changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.&quot; (AAP) &quot;Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? No.&quot; (the other APA) Further, it is not clear that these organizations would accept a conversion therapist's word at face value when he says that his theory doesn't presuppose that homosexuality is a mental disorder (the APA, e.g., has already blasted the conversion therapy literature for their misrepresentations: [http://www.psych.org/psych_pract/copptherapyaddendum83100.cfm], rec. #3). [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:38, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

:::::::::Gender-affirmation therapy is not &quot;directed specifically at changing sexual orientation&quot;.  That is the whole point of GAT.  It focuses on affirming your own sense of your gender rather than changing orientation.  All of the quotes that you provided are about changing orientation, which is not the point of GAT.  It may be the byproduct (there is no scientific evidence whether orientation can change or not), but it is not &quot;directed specifically at changing sexual orientation&quot;.  Medical organizations have issued several statements placing restrictions, expressing concerns, outlining pitfalls and otherwise moderating the treatment those seeking conversion therapy receive.  The reason they do that is so that their advice can be followed.  GAT follows this advice.  It follows the restrictions, it takes into account the warnings and it avoids the pitfalls.  Gerald Koocher, president of the APA, sums it up by saying: &quot;In a full multifaceted therapeutic relationship, the therapist has every duty to respond to patient choice and to help patients achieve their goals.... BUT... [First,] therapists must determine whether patients understand that their motives may arise purely from the social pressures of a homophobic environment.... [and second,] patients must understand that [treatments to modify sexual orientation] lack a validated scientific foundation and may prove psychologically harmful.&quot;  That is almost verbatim the first two phases of sexual identity therapy &quot;(1)assessment, (2) advanced or expanded informed consent.&quot;  They followed Koocher's advice in every part.

:::::::::Your second point that &quot;it is not clear that these organizations would accept a conversion therapist's word at face value&quot; is so [[WP:OR]] it almost doesn't even deserve an answer.  There is no evidence that these therapists are irreputable, and your [[guilt by association]] argument is not sufficient.  These therapists are licensed under the APA and regularly publish in peer-reviewed journals.  If it were found out that they were acting unethically or disobeying the restrictions APA has placed on conversion therapy, including practicing under the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder, they would be kicked out and have their licenses removed, as is what happened with [[Richard A.

JJ, help me to assume good faith, here. Scanning through the &quot;Counseling Today&quot; pdf, it's very clear that your summary radically misrepresents the thrust of the article, which never mentions the word &quot;ex-gay&quot; much less recommending a referral to their agencies. On the contrary, it says, &quot;Counselors wishing to serve this population should get acquainted with the GLBT-affirmative religious bodies in
their areas.&quot; Please.

Reading a source and seeing it so misrepresented by the text you cite to it is going to make me very, very uneasy about any sources you use that can't be immediately checked by clicking a url.

Separate from issues of content, I'm not sure about your phrase &quot;Counseling Today recommends.&quot; Is this appropriate language for an article in a magazine that is not by the magazine's editorial board, but has independent authors?

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 02:31, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:The main thrust of the article, as I understand it, was &quot;more attention ought to be paid to integrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) issues and spiritual identity into the range of multicultural competencies.&quot;  I summarized it by saying that psychologists should &quot;be aware of the spiritual implications in reconciling their patients' religious beliefs with their sexual identity.&quot;  That by itself, neither in the original article, nor in my summary, says whether that religious beliefs should be gay-affirming or not.  The article then goes on to look at several different aspects of the effect religion has on a client.  Like you said, it does say to be aware of gay-affirming churches, but it also warns counselors &quot;not to proselytize or put that on the client’s experience.&quot;  They can discuss these gay-affirming churches, but they are told not to tell patients &quot;you’ve got to give up your church.&quot;  Counselors should be open to the patient's religious beliefs, even if the &quot;mainstream denomination does not support who they are, they shouldn’t have to leave their church.&quot;  It then includes a list of religious resources, both gay-affirming and non-gay-affirming alike.  One of them, which is what I referenced in the article, was the ex-gay organization [[Courage International]].  You are right, the article did not have the word &quot;ex-gay&quot; in it.  I summarized this by saying the article &quot;recommends counselors to be open to referring patients to ex-gay organizations like [[Courage International]].&quot;  Neither the article nor my summary is an endorsement of ex-gay groups, just the fact that they list it.  My purpose of including this article was that it told counselors to be sensitive to the patients' religious beliefs and included ex-gay organizations in a list of possible referrals for the patient.

:How about this for a change?[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 04:31, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:*An article in Counseling Today which discusses spirituality for gays recommends that counselors should not tell patients they have to leave their church, even if the religion only allows celibacy or marriage.  Although it discusses several gay-affirmative religious groups, it encourages counselors not to proselytize these views onto their patient.  At the end of the article, it includes [[Courage International]] with a list of otherwise gay-affirmative religious groups to which the counselor may refer a patient.

::Well, the problem with this version is that it in no way addresses the subject of the article, conversion therapy! [[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 04:48, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Courage is a religious organization that uses religious techniques to help people overcome homosexuality.  It was listed under religious techniques.  The point is that although these organizations have issued precautions against conversion groups and ex-gay groups, it can still ethically allow patients to have their own religious beliefs and even refer patients to these organizations.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 05:29, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

Responding to Joshua's original suggestion: I'm a bit two-faced here.  I agree that the article should not be called &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; because it's anachronistic to refer to, e.g., Rado's theories as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;.  ''But'', it's also misleading to say that, today, &quot;reparative therapy&quot; is one distinct type of conversion therapy among many.  ''Today'', &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; are generally treated synonymously in the literature.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] 02:57, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

This quote was removed from the article with the reason that the quote was later clarified.  This issue had been discussed before, but I didn't have time to address it.  Now I do.  As I remember correctly, Fireplace objected to this quote because he felt a later quote clarified what he originally meant.  I think that is OR.  The new quote did not negate anything in the previous quote.  This quote is from a reliable newspaper and it is valid.

A personal anecdote: I once had a Taiwanese student from a Taoist family, who told me that when he came out to his parents as a teen, they took him to a traditional Taoist practitioner who tried to de-gay him by means of prayer, yelling, freezing water treatments, and burnt herbs. It didn't work. Maybe someone could dig up a source on this sort of thing if it's widespread?

I wish to challenge the neutrality of this article.  The majority of text on the page in question supports the argument that reparation (or conversion) therapy is useless or harmful.  That amounts to promoting an opinion.  Reference is indeed made to people who hold other opinions, but those opinions are quickly dismissed or disparaged.  A truly neutral article would give those opinions a fair chance.  Disagreeing with gays is not the same as hating gays. [[User:Shoes6|Shoes6]] 16:35, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

::What? There is no consensus that conversion therapy is harmful.  Where do you get that idea?  I quote from the APA &quot;To date, there are '''no''' scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy '''or harm''' of &quot;reparative&quot; treatments.&quot;  They have been very careful in only stating potential for harm, which is different than saying it is harmful.  Almost ever therapy has potential for harm.  They have said &quot;anecdotal reports of &quot;cures&quot; are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm.&quot;  However, I think this article has lost that balance.  Both anecdotal evidences of harm and cures are covered by reliable, third party sources, but only anecdotal evidences of harm are covered in this article.  I agree with Shoes6 in his assertion that that is not a neutral treatment.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 19:51, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

::: The APA's position represents a consensus among the psychiatric community that &quot;The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior&quot; [APA Position Statement on Psychiatric Treatment and Sexual Orientation December 11, 1998].

::::Yes, there are antecdotal claims of psychological harm for reparative therapy, just as there are anecdotal reports of 'cures'.  Potential for harm does not mean harmful, just as potential for success does not mean successful.  But that is reparative therapy, not all conversion therapies.  I am not an advocate of reparative therapies, as you claim, but of gender-affirmative therapies, which are completely inline with modern ethic codes.  There is a lot of room for abuse, which abuse has been well-documented, and the ethic codes were written to address that.  As long as they follow these standards &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.&quot;[http://wthrockmorton.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html]  Psychologists across the US and other parts of the world legally practice conversion therapy and have thousands of antecdotal stories of success.  I am an advocate of a NPOV, and that is the mainstream view on the topic.

::::: It's understandable that reparative--sorry, &quot;gender affirmative&quot;--therapists describe sexual orientation as mutable. Their livelihood depends on it. But, if the mainstream view did not reflect that sexual orientation is innate, then ex-gays would not self-identify as &quot;ex-gays.&quot; They would simply be &quot;heterosexuals.&quot; And, I suppose, the whole point of this article would then be moot.

I would like to officially challenge the neutrality of the section ''Conversion therapy/ex-gays as a means to shape the LGBT rights debate''.  This is an important section, and even the APA has declared &quot;the issue of changing sexual orientation has become highly politicized.&quot;  However, the APA did not take sides, as this section has done and has stated &quot;The political and moral debates surrounding this issue have obscured the scientific data by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on '''both''' sides of the issue.&quot;  This section only calls into question the motives of one side of the debate, not both sides.  The paragraph is written with a very strong LGBT activist slant, and we are led to believe that social conservatives are just out to get the poor little innocent LGBTs.  Interestingly enough, the very reference for the assertion that social conservatives say LGBTs should not have, among other things, social acceptance, is an article reporting how [[Alan Chambers]] believes LGBTs ''should'' have social acceptance, but that he is against gay marriage. Let's rewrite this article to fairly show ''both'' sides of the debate.[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] 23:57, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

** I don't know, I think it's helpful to have this content split off.  The majority of the literature that's arisen regarding conversion therapy comes from the US, and having a bulleted, separate section for non-U.S. material allows the reader to do a cross-country comparison that would be harder if the content were integrated with the rest of the text.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:10, 6 January 2008 (UTC)
* changing the Nazism section - I think it biases people and give undue weight to the Nazis when most of the participants in WWII were preforming conversions. Did the Germany's use conversion before Nazism and continue to after?
* remove or justify extraneous info e.g. &quot;In Norway, a country known for its '''strong LGBT rights legislation'''&quot;... So what? If it had weak LGBT right legislation would that change the point? or &quot;In India, psychiatry and psychology scholars have &quot;preserved an almost complete silence on the subject of homosexuality&quot;.[66] '''One paper discusses behavior modification methods used to treat the sexual orientation of thirteen gay patients.'''[67]&quot; I'm not sure what this means. There is only one paper that discusses the methods used? Some of the only available material is a paper published on the methods used on thirteen gay patients?
** Norway is famously progressive with respect to gay rights issues, so I think it's helpful to include that as context.

==Irrelevant criticism==

Part of the article reads, 'Critics argue that it [the Spitzer study] relied upon samples selected by conversion therapists themselves (86 participants were handpicked by ex-gay organizations), that proper random samplings were not used, that small samplings were used, that the subjects appeared to be ex-gay advocates who may have been biased in favor of conversion therapies, that 60% of the subjects had previously reported being bisexual, and that no follow-up study had been carried out to ascertain long-term conversion' Some of those criticisms may have some validity, but one of them is clearly irrelevant: the objection that a random sampling was not used. Since Spitzer's study was not intended to be representative, the lack of a random sampling is not important. The article would be improved if this could be made clear.

==Addition of neutrality tag==
I added a neutrality tag to this article for several reasons. Let me start out by saying that I do have a personal vested interest in this as I am a gay man who suffered under the care of a conversion therapist for two years. A path which I ultimately abandoned. So I am not a proponent of conversion therapy. However, I do think that people should have the right to pursue whatever treatment they feel is best for them. That being said, I do think this article overstates the APA disaproval on conversion therapy.
* For one thing the wikipedia article reads as if the APA actually said that &quot;reparative therapy creates an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish&quot;. This is not the case. The quote comes not from the APA but a psychologist interviewed by a gay publication. To my knowledge, the APA has never made such a strong stance against conversion therapy.
**Well, there's a reliable third-party source saying it was an APA statement, but since the source isn't ideal, I've removed the quote from the lead but left it in the body of the article. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* Second, the article does not fully explain the APA's position on reparative therapy. The reason why the organization has not condemned the practice is because of the guiding principle of the APA to respect and remain neutral on religous beliefs and practices. Out of respect for a clients religion, therapists do not try to impose values opposed to that religous system onto there clients. To do so is viewed as highly unethical by the APA. It is for this reason that the APA has not banned the practice of conversion therapy, although they do have high concerns over the potential harm such therapy may produce.
** The article could certainly use some streamlining, but I think that it does capture the APA's stance on these issues.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy#Client_self-determination_aspect section on client self-determination] seems to address this.  What language do you want to change, or what reliable sources do you want to include?  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* There are several other ethical factors involved such as personal autonomy. These are central ethical issues surrounding the debate over conversion therapy and there lack of discussion here biases this article in favor of banning conversion therapy. I don't have the articles in front of me but I am sure it would be easy to look up. The APA has discussed the ethics of this decision to not ban conversion therapy on numerous ocassions and in numerous articles in their own journal. The lack of such journal citations seems a huge oversite within this article.
** I've done extensive searches through academic journals and bibliographies on conversion therapy, and I believe most relevant articles are already cited in the article.  Which ones exactly are you referring to? [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* In fairness, I also feel that the article does not state the weeknesses in arguements against conversion therapy. Unfortunately, there is no scientific evidence to document the potential harm of conversion therapy. A fact which I think the article states but the implications of which are not clearly explained. Just as there is no strong conclusive study on the sucsess of such treatments, likewise there is no conclusive documenting study against such therapies.
** The current structure of the article is to state the official position of the various mental health organizations (e.g., &quot;There is potential for harm when clients participate in conversion therapy&quot; from the ACA or &quot;potential risks of 'reparative therapy' are great&quot; from the APA) and also to discuss the lack of extensive data (&quot;anecdotal reports of 'cures' are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm.&quot; It further states that there are no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine the actual harm of conversion treatments&quot;).  That seems to capture what the reliable sources say about this.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* The truth of the matter is, is that conversion therapy is a shady science where there really hasn't been much research done, for or against. So although morally people might have objections to such therapies, they really can't say scientifically that such therapies don't work and are harmful. The stance of the APA therefore, has been criticized by many professional psychologists and members of the organization for pre-emptive judgment on this issue that is based in opinion and politics rather than actual scientific fact. These critics do include psychologists who are highly skeptical of reparative therapy as well as those who are more open to such practices. Sadly, the APA won't help fund research in this area of therapy. I say sad because I think such research would show the hipocracy of the whole ex-gay movement and the fact that you can't make someone straight. It would show the damging effects such therapies have on people in a provable factual unbiased manner. As it is, no such proof exsists and until it does neither side can definitively defend there position. It should be noted too that critics of APAs accusations on the negative effects of conversion therapy have responded by pointing out that such traits like suicide, self-destructive behavior, and depression are also common among young gay men and gay men just coming out and are concerns that the LGBT community have for the mental health of young gay men. So if such traits are found in those going through conversion therapy, is it the therapy or the fact that they are wrestling with the5re sexuality at all the  factor causing such symptoms.
** Some of what you say above is already discussed in the article, other parts seem like personal opinion or original research.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* Also, the article tends to marginalize opposing positions to the APAs stance as some sort of fringe group in the psychological community. This is not the case either.
** Skepticism and concern about conversion therapy is widespread, and the article cites reliable sources saying as much. [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
* There are a significant amount of psychologists that support conversion therapy, including the former head of the APA among others. It's not the majority but enough to avoid comments in the article which seem dismissive, especially since many supporters of conversion therapy hold important positions and are highly published in leading psychology journals.
** The article includes quotes from some such people.  If you know of more and there are reliable sources, feel free to add them.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:21, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

: A further comment, although I am not entirely against using gay oriented publications as cited references, I think this article may relye a little too heavily on them. Gay media does have a vested interest in this issue and is therefore open to allegations of bias. When possible, I think this article should try to utilize mainstreem media and professional counceling and psychology publications to present information in order to avoid allegations of bias. Also, not all gay activists are opposed to reparative therapy in all instances (especialy when religous beliefs may hold a more powerful place within a clients sense of self then there own sexuality) and many therapists who oppose reparative therapy as a general practice do think it is a viable approach as a last resort in order to avoid suicide.[[User:Nrswanson|Nrswanson]] ([[User talk:Nrswanson|talk]]) 13:18, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

== A client interested in conversion therapy has the right to seek it ==

The following was removed from the lead: &quot;a client interested in conversion therapy has the right to seek it.&quot;  Why?  It follows what all major medical organizations have said:
*From the American Psychological Association: &quot;Mental health professional organizations call on their members to respect a person’s (client’s) right to self-determination.&quot;  The President clarified this in saying &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction.&quot;
*From the American Counseling Association: &quot;It is of primary importance to respect a client's autonomy to request a referral for a service not offered by a counselor.&quot;
*From the American Psychiatric Association: &quot;Psychologists respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination.&quot;
*From the World Health Organization: &quot;The gender identity or sexual preference (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or prepubertal) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it.&quot;
I see no evidence anywhere where a client does not have the right to get conversion therapy.  I know from personal experience that you can legally get it from licensed psychologists with full approval of the APA.  All they have ever done is officially express concern.  The way it is currently written is misleading and either needs to be fixed or removed from Good Article Status. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 17:55, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
:None of the sources you mention refer to a &quot;right to seek&quot; conversion therapy -- you're making an interpretative leap.  It is true that conversion therapy is legal and that the American Psychological Association does not say that conversion therapy is ''per se'' unethical (in contrast, the American Psychiatric Association &quot;recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation&quot;).  The article can and should say as much.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 21:20, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::The WHO source does.  &quot;the individual ... may seek treatment in order to change it.&quot;  As for the other sources, how do you think would be non-POV way to put it?  All of these quotes are from documents that are specifically addressing conversion therapy and are related to them.  Psychologists are called upon to respect a client's right to self-determine their goals to change their sexual orientation within therapy?  It is of primary importance to respect a client's autonomy to request a referral for a service not offered by a counselor such as conversion therapy?  You also removed the direct quote &quot;Mental health professional organizations call on their members to respect a person’s (client’s) right to self-determination.&quot; saying it was taken out of context.  How was that taken out of context?  Could we just have that sentence? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:36, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
:::First, I'll respond specifically to each of the sources you cited: 
::::(1) The ACA language is taken out of context: the ACA goes on to say that &quot;To refer a client to someone who engages in conversion therapy communicates to the client that his/her same-sex attractions and behaviors are disordered and, therefore, need to be changed. This contradicts the dictates of the 2005 ACA Code of Ethics&quot; and that &quot;Considering all the above deliberation, the ACA Ethics Committee strongly suggests that ethical professional counselors do not refer clients to someone who engages in conversion therapy or, if they do so, to proceed cautiously only when they are certain that the referral counselor fully informs clients of the unproven nature of the treatment and the potential risks and takes steps to minimize harm to clients...&quot;
:::::&quot;if they do so&quot; implies that they can.  They go on to say &quot;The responsibility of counseling professionals at this juncture is to help clients make the most appropriate choices for themselves without the counselor imposing her/his values. To do so respects a client's request and leaves open the possibility that the client can return to the professional counselor if the conversion therapy is ineffective and harms the client.&quot;  and further &quot;if clients still decide that they wish to seek conversion therapy as a form of treatment, counselors should also help clients understand what types of information they should seek from any practitioner who does engage in conversion therapy. The Committee members agree that counselors who offer conversion therapy are providing &quot;treatment that has no empirical or scientific foundation.&quot;  I'm not saying they don't advise against it.  I am saying they allow counselors to practice it and they respect the client's right to seek conversion therapy, and after all the other conditions they have outlined, it is that right to seek it that &quot;is of primary importance.&quot; [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:55, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::::(2) The American Psychiatric Association specifically &quot;recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation.&quot;  
:::::Recommendation to refrain does not nullify &quot;rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination.&quot;  You cut off the addition &quot;keeping in mind the medical dictum to First, do no harm.&quot;  Going against a patient's autonomy is harmful. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:55, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::::(3) The WHO language is, as we and other have discussed before on this talk page, exceptionally confusingly written.  It is not clear whether &quot;may&quot; is ''prescriptive'' of what the person's options should be, or ''descriptive'' of what the condition itself is.  
:::::I didn't agree with you then and I don't agree with you now.  India seems to have the same interpretation as I do.

[[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:55, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::::(4) The American Psychological Association's language is quoting a general ethical maxim without specifically elaborating on its application in this context (perhaps because there isn't a consensus amongst the drafters as to how it applies in this context).  Your interpretation is plausible, but so is the interpretation that the guideline here functions to prohibit therapists from advocating conversion therapy to clients who do not want it.
:::::It is not some general ethical maxim.  It is in the section &quot;What about therapy intended to change sexual orientation from gay to straight?&quot;  They are specifically talking about conversion therapy.  You suggested that it was a prohibition &quot;from advocating conversion therapy to clients who do not want it.&quot;  It is both.  Not only one side gets the right to self-determination.  If I want it, I can get it.  If I don't, you can't force me to.  That is respecting a client's autonomy.  It does not just work one way.  The statement &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction&quot; clearly applies to conversion therapy and a client's right to seek it.

:::Stepping back, it's very difficult to craft a short (i.e., lead-appropriate) summary of the nuances of the ethical guidelines related to conversion therapy.  I think that the following language would do it: &quot;The ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy that do not state that such therapy is ''per se'' unethical (American Psychological Association) to recommending that ethical practitioners refrain from using conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or referring patients to others who do (American Counseling Association).&quot; [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 22:34, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

It's unfortunate that this has had a religious focus that makes some people upset.  As someone not on the &quot;religious right&quot; I'm concerned with people's mental health. I don't think it's prejudicial to observe that when you can't stand to be in your body, there's something wrong. I'm interested in knowing any valid, honest information on any studies in the area of medication or non-religious psychotherapy for the psychological discomfort described in transgender disorder cases.Anybody got any data, minus political posturing?

== Camille Paglia ==

The article currently reads, 'Support for conversion therapy has even been found among gay activists. Camille Paglia, a lesbian activist, wrote in her book Tramps and Vamps, &quot;Is the gay identity so fragile that it cannot bear the thought that some people may not wish to be gay? Sexuality is highly fluid and reversals are theoretically possible.&quot;[179]'

This gives a somewhat misleading idea of Paglia's views. She was criticising the extreme reaction of some gay people to some people's decision to try to change, not necessarily advocating conversion therapy. The reference to Paglia connects to an article on NARTH's website, which includes some quotes from ''Vamps and Tramps'', notably not including this, on page 78: 'The injustice and impracticality are in trying to &quot;convert&quot; totally from homosexuality to heterosexuality, an opposition I think false.' The description of Paglia as an 'activist' is also rather off. Actually she is a literary scholar. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:10, 26 April 2008 (UTC)

== Conversion therapy is not a pseudoscience ==
If conversion therapy were a pseudoscience, then the APA wouldn't allow physicians to practice it under their licenses, have presentations at their conferences on it, and publish guidelines on how to do it.  The official statement by the APA includes the quote: &quot;APA encourages and supports research in the NIMH and the academic research community to further determine &quot;reparative&quot; therapy's risks versus its benefits.&quot;  The APA wouldn't support research into pseudo science.  The only evidence of it being a pseudoscience is a paper written back in the 1990's by gay psychologist Dr. Haldeman, who has since written a paper supporting the right of a client to seek it professionally.  Yes, they discourage it, warn of potential harms including a harmful environment and have found several faults in the premises surrounding reparative therapy, but that doesn't mean it is a pseudoscience.  You need to find an official source saying mainstream organizations consider it a pseudoscience or remove it from the pseudoscience category.

Still, I think it's now clear that [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson's]] argument above that &quot;If conversion therapy were a pseudoscience, then the APA wouldn't allow physicians to practice it under their licenses ...&quot; is invalid, on the grounds that one cannot disprove the proposition that any particular practice is pseudoscience simply by pointing out that some licensed therapists are allowed to practice it. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 06:28, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
::There are numerous reasons why it would be wrong to label conversion therapy a 'pseudo-science.' 'Pseudo-science' is often used to mean something that claims to be science but is not. Therapies are activities or practices, which may be based on scientific theories of some sort but are not themselves claimed to be 'science.' Since therapy itself is not claimed to be a science, the label pseudo-science cannot apply. It would be like calling baseball a pseudo-science. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:04, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:::If that is the case, then any valid arguments which may support the thesis that conversion therapy is not pseudoscience should be listed. The fact that some therapists are sometimes allowed by the APA to practice conversion therapy is not one of those valid arguments. Therapy may be an art, but psychology is a science, and homosexuality is not considered an illness in the psychological community. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 06:49, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
(unidented)There are a lot of points to respond to.  Let's see if I can get them all:
#[[User talk:Fireplace|Fireplace]] argues &quot;that conversion therapy, as practiced throughout most of its history, is pseudoscientific.&quot;  In high school, my chemistry teacher said that 90% of what he was teaching us was going to be disproved in our life times.  Does that make chemistry pseudoscientific?  Until 1992, any form of homosexuality was considered a mental illness by the World Health Organization.  Is it any surprise that theories presented by conversion therapist followed modern, mainstream thinking and indicated that same sex attractions stemmed from a mental illness?  Hind-sight is 20-20.  Science changes.  Let's get over the past.  Conversion therapy as practiced 20 years ago, relied on the mainstream thinking of 20 years ago.  That is hardly pseudo-scientific.
#The way I am interpreting [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]]'s argument, (s)he thinks conversion therapy as practiced today should be considered a pseudo science because homosexuality is not an illness.  There are two problems with this argument.  (1) Just because someone wants to diminish homosexual attractions doesn't mean they think it is an illness.  Many modern approaches, such as [[Sexual Identity Therapy]] focus on aligning sexual behaviors with internal values.  That has nothing to do with thinking it is an illness.  (2)  (S)he said &quot;homosexuality is not considered an illness in the psychological community.&quot;  We aren't talking about [[ego-syntonic]] homosexuality, but [[ego-dystonic homosexuality]].  That is indeed considered a mental illness according to the [[WHO]], not that I necessarily believe that.  Even the DSM has a diagnosis for persistent and marked distress about one’s sexual orientation.
#Both have argued that my argument that because licensed psychologists practice it doesn't mean it isn't pseudoscientific.  That may be true, but I still think it is a good indicator.
#No one has addressed my argument that why would the APA hold a conference and allow [[Sexual Identity Therapy]] to be presented at it if it were based on sound psychology?
#What reliable sources have been presented that indicate it is pseudoscientific? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 08:46, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
::I think either Joshuajohanson or I may have conflated two arguments. I have not stated a position on whether or not conversion therapy is a pseudoscience. I have only made the argument that the very existence of reparative therapists does not logically disprove the pseudoscientific status of reparative therapy, which refutation I believe Joshuajohanson was trying to make when he started this talk-page section.
::Some people certainly do hold the opinion that reparative therapy offers more lasting benefit to clients who are ego-dystonic than affirmative therapy would. We must accept the fact that some people believe this. In view of the fact that the article is about reparative therapy, and not about the status of gays and lesbians in the world, it seems suitable (and encyclopedic) to reference any experts who people in this field may consider notable, as long as those references are up-to-date, and where equally suitable refutations are also referenced. However, it would be [[WP:UNDUE]] to give the pro-reparative argument equal weight--and, indeed, the article does not.

==Misrepresentation of the use of the term reparative therapy==
I think this article fails to point out the fact that most therapists actually practicing conversion therapy prefer the term reparative therapy. The article currently states &quot;The label conversion is often preferred over reparative, as the latter suggests that same-sex desire is something which can or should be repaired.&quot; This is certainly true for opponents of conversion therapy. However, advocates of conversion therapy tend to use the term reparative therapy, which the article does not currently state. If you actuatly go to the NARTH website you will see that their literature tends to use this term.[[User:Nrswanson|Nrswanson]] ([[User talk:Nrswanson|talk]]) 02:56, 15 May 2008 (UTC)
:Please see my post below - 'The first sentence of this article' - on why this is a mistake. Reparative therapy is only one kind of conversion therapy.

==Sexual activity versus Sex==

This article frequently uses the expression 'sexual activity' where plain old fashioned 'sex' would be better. I propose to replace 'sexual activity' with 'sex', which means the same thing and has eleven fewer letters. If there are no objections within the next two days, I will assume that no one disagrees or can suggest a reason why I shouldn't do this, and will go ahead. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:53, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:Actually I only see it used three times, and each circumstance would be clumsy otherwise. If the first instance, ''&quot;avoiding same-sex sexual activity&quot;'' was changed to &quot;avoiding same-sex sex&quot;, it would sound silly. --[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] ([[User talk:Knulclunk|talk]]) 13:22, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:::I agree that the expression 'same-sex sex' would be silly. The words 'same-sex' do not need to be used at all, however. In this context, they mean exactly the same thing as 'homosexual' and that's the word that should be there. I accept that for the time being I've lost the struggle over changing 'gay' and 'lesbian' to 'homosexual', but I submit that there is no reason why 'same-sex' has to be used in cases where 'homosexual' has the same connotation.

::::::If I heard that someone had sex with someone else, I wouldn't necessarily assume anything. Seriously speaking, if a behavior like anilingus (often called 'rimming') that does not even involve the genitals counts as sex, then passionate kissing counts as sex too.

==The first sentence of this article==

The first sentence of this article begins, 'Conversion therapy, sometimes called sexual reorientation therapy or reparative therapy...' This is not actually wrong - conversion therapy is sometimes called reparative therapy, just as it is called a lot of other things, but it is misleading, as has been pointed out numerous times. Elsewhere, the article says, 'Sometimes reparative therapy is misleadingly used synonymously with conversion therapy, though in fact it is only one type of conversion therapy.' This is true, and that's why the article should not begin the way it does. I have taken the liberty of changing the article without waiting for a discussion because it really was just wrong the way it was. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:16, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

: Fine by me but in that case I think the sentence &quot;The label conversion is often preferred over reparative, as the latter suggests that same-sex desire is something which can or should be &quot;repaired&quot; should be removed from the lead.[[User:Nrswanson|Nrswanson]] ([[User talk:Nrswanson|talk]]) 22:05, 17 May 2008 (UTC)

==Terminology==

As a result of a recent edit war between myself and several other people, this article now uses an inconsistent mixture of terms to describe people attracted to the same sex. Sometimes 'homosexual' is used, and sometimes 'gay' or 'lesbian', with no apparent logic to the choices. Presumably this happened because those who were undoing my edits did it so quickly that they may not have realized exactly what they were doing - several cases of my changing 'gay' to 'homosexual' seem to have escaped notice. The article ought to use consistent terminology (I would prefer it if 'homosexual' was used throughout the article except in direct quotes, but I realize that I'm not going to get my way on this). My only request to whoever edits the article to resolve this situation is to at least not use the silly acronyms - GLBT, LGBT, GLB or whatever - where it can be avoided. They're a mutilation of the English language. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:19, 18 May 2008 (UTC)
:I'm going through and restoring the original language (using gay, not homosexual).  I appreciate that terms like [[LGBT]] (or LGB, when trans people are excluded) take some getting used to, but they are part of the mainstream public discourse today -- presumably because using the full &quot;lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender&quot; is a mouthful and makes a text more difficult to read.  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 16:05, 18 May 2008 (UTC)
::Terms like 'LGBT' are the language of an elite of activists who do not represent ordinary gay men and lesbians (or for that matter bisexuals and transsexuals). They are ugly and silly terms that can be objected to on numerous grounds. For example, the article now reads: 'The 1969 riots at the Stonewall Inn began a movement of LGBT visibility and policy reform.' The term 'LGBT' ''wasn't even used'' in 1969 so this is a misrepresentation of history. I will change this (probably to 'gay') if no one gives a good reason why I shouldn't. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:37, 19 May 2008 (UTC)
:::I'm fine with replacing that instance of ''LGBT'' with ''gay and lesbian''.  Regarding the use of the term more generally, I think you'll find it's made its way into the mainstream (see, e.g., [http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zAb&amp;q=LGBT+-wiki&amp;btnG=Search]).  [[User:Fireplace|Fireplace]] ([[User talk:Fireplace|talk]]) 03:14, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

==Wording of the introduction==

The introduction contains a sentence that reads, 'Today's conversion therapists characterize the movement as offering the possibility of a choice to gay men and lesbian women who are unhappy with their sexuality.' I've already tried to point out what is wrong with this. Conversion therapists typically do not like or use terms like 'gay men', so this sentence effectively represents them as saying something that they do not say. The 'gay men' and 'lesbian women' who are not satisfied with their sexuality also generally do not use these terms or want them applied to themselves, so that's deeply unfair to them. This part of the article could be made fair without using the word 'homosexuals' by changing it to, 'Today's conversion therapists characterize the movement as offering the possibility of a choice to people who are unhappy with their attraction to the same sex.' I can't see why anyone should object to this. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:32, 18 May 2008 (UTC)
:Since no one objected I made the change. It's clearer and more precise this way (since it is specifically their same sex attractions that the people in question are dissatisfied with, rather than their 'sexuality' in general - a much broader concept). [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:38, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

==Something else that should be changed==

Part of the article reads, 'The label reparative originates from 1983 when research psychologist Elizabeth Moberly coined the term reparative drive to refer to male homosexuality itself, interpreting male–male desires...' This is expressed very badly. The term 'male-male' does not make sense in English. I am going to change this to something that actually makes sense - male homosexual desire, maybe; I'm open to other suggestions - in the near future in the absence of objections.

== APA affirms principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation: ==

In 1997, the APA sent out a resolution that included these words:

&quot;Therefore be it resolved that APA affirms the following principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation:&quot;

I summarized it by saying by saying they &quot;affirmed the principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation.&quot;  I really tried to keep the same wording, but it was removed with the paraphrase &quot;this phrasing misleadingly makes it sound as though the APA has established principals within which it approves of conversion therapy -- that is not what the source says.&quot;  Am I missing something?

:Yes, the use of the word 'but' in your proposed language (''No mainstream medical organization endorses conversion therapy but they have affirmed the principles with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation'') misleadingly suggests that the principles are somehow opposed to or qualify the lack of endorsement.

== Debate within Professional Literature ==

In 1997, the APA stated:

:Whereas the ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of therapies that seek to reduce or eliminate same-gender sexual orientation are under extensive debate in the professional literature and the popular media 

I have not seen any official statement refuting that.  In 2004, the Counseling Psychologist published a paper saying &quot;the topic of sexual-identity conflicts cannot be framed as it has been - that is, a war between opposing camps, with reparative therapists on one side and gay-affirmative therapists on the other. Ultimately, the client is the one who will be caught in the crossfire.&quot;

There is a debate in the field.  Simple as that. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 07:08, 19 May 2008 (UTC)
:I don't disagree that there is debate in the professional literature and popular media.  Regarding your revision and edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=213419665&amp;oldid=213419132 here], two points: (1) First, procedurally, it's disingenuous to reprimand me by saying &quot;Please trying talking about things for making major changes.&quot;  The section has been specifically about the client self-determination issue for a very long time (close to a year), until you rewrote it without discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=206140715&amp;oldid=205939423 here].  I was away at the time and so did not immediately revert and discuss.  (2) Second, substantively, the original, stable version of that section was about a discrete topic that is fairly widely discussed in the literature.  The presentation of that issue was well-written and cited a variety of articles to lay out a coherent dialectic.  Your new version puts unrelated quotes next to each other and obscures the self-determination content.  That's why I reverted it.

::I apologize for the disingenuous reprimand.  As you probably noticed, it is easy to get emotional about this topic.  I actually do like discussing things with you because at least you are logical, even though we differ on opinion.  To the point, I do not see how the new version puts unrelated quotes together.  The main debate seems to be self-determination and possibility for change versus potential for harm, though neither side has been proven.  I organized it with a summary, the official position promoting self-determination, arguments supporting self-determination, the official position warning potential for harm, and arguments against CT (which are quotes that I originally added, trying to be fair).  I ended it with an observation about the debate and the harm it causes clients.  I do not see how it is unrelated phrases stuck together.  The original presented self-determination as if only conversion therapist were concerned about that.  It also didn't cover other aspects of the debate such as evidence for success as well as the harm of the debate.  We need a neutral section on the debate and I have been trying to get it in for a long time.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=118202126&amp;oldid=118200605]  We can have a self-determination section which is neutrally presented (the old &quot;stable&quot; one wasn't), but we definitely need a section on the debate as well.

I know of tons of people with same sex attraction who were too scared to see a psychologist because they were afraid s/he would tell them that they should just accept the fact that they were gay.  Many of them had developed other problems from being so closeted and full of self hate.  While the world goes on in political debate, real people are suffering, and no, not all of them would be happy with the gay lifestyle, as indicated by the research by Douglas Haldeman.  And also, if we do have a self-determination section, it should not be presented as going contrary to modern psychology.

What context do you think is necessary to put that quote in context.  After he made the quote he reiterated some of the basic principles that have already been confirmed.  Would this be enough context?
:The President of the [[American Psychological Association]] has said: &quot;The APA has no conflict with psychologists who help those distressed by unwanted homosexual attraction,&quot; provided they follow the several principles affirmed by the APA with regard to treatments to alter sexual orientation.

But Koocher clarified his comments soon after, stating that &quot;in a full multifaceted therapeutic relationship, the therapist has every duty to respond to patient choice and to help patients achieve their goals.... BUT... [First,] therapists must determine whether patients understand that their motives may arise purely from the social pressures of a homophobic environment.... [and second,] patients must understand that [treatments to modify sexual orientation] lack a validated scientific foundation and may prove psychologically harmful.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Non ex-gay relapses (removed from article) ==
* Terrance Lewis was a minister and former counsellor at Providence Bible College in Winnipeg, Canada who was found guilty in February 2008 for sexually assaulting a young man who sought counselling to make him heterosexual. The alleged victim, now 29, told court he started meeting Lewis for counselling sessions in early 2000 after his parents caught him viewing gay pornography on the family computer. The man said Lewis started a program of “touch therapy,” which included the two kissing and fondling each other and engaging in sexual roleplaying. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Winnipeg/2008/02/14/4847839.html winnipegsun.com - Winnipeg News - Man found guilty in gay &quot;therapy&quot; case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2008/02/12/4841898-sun.html CANOE - CNEWS - Crime: Bible college counsellor accused as gay predator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Haggard denied even knowing Mike Jones, but as a media investigation proceeded he acknowledged that some allegations, such as his purchase of [[methamphetamine]], were true. He later added &quot;sexual immorality&quot; to his list of confessions. After the scandal was publicized, Haggard entered three weeks of intensive counseling, overseen by four ministers.

:Both of these do not belong in the section with the ex-ex-gays.  Neither Haggard or Lewis are cited as having claimed to be &quot;ex-gay&quot; at any point--Rather, both appear to have been closeted and acting against their professed belief systems.  While both events seem notable, I don't see any connection between Haggard and conversion therapy established by the text.  Lewis might be appropriate in the section on abuses occurring during conversion therapy. [[User:Jclemens|Jclemens]] ([[User talk:Jclemens|talk]]) 07:58, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

:The stuff about Ted Haggard certainly didn't belong where it was, and arguably didn't belong in the article at all. I'm not sure why you removed the stuff about Lewis, however. The section it was in is called 'Relapses and other scandals', so it isn't just about ex-ex-gays. This is an example of an 'other' scandal, so it should probably just go back in the article. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 10:55, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
::Lewis is definitely more borderline.  Here's a thought--why not include it in the prior section?  It's an abuse by a non-ex-gay counselor of a patient during conversion therapy, even if the patient is not a minor.  I think it would be better to include all the &quot;abuses&quot; in one section, and all the &quot;relapses&quot; in another, and chuck the stuff that's neither an abuse nor a relapse, like Haggard. [[User:Jclemens|Jclemens]] ([[User talk:Jclemens|talk]]) 16:07, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
::My point was that the section you removed that from was called, 'Relapses and other scandals.' Thus, its content doesn't necessarily have to be about ex-gays going back to being gay. It could be about pretty much any kind of ex-gay scandal. If necessary, it could be reworded to make this clearer. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:17, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
:::Eh, I'd rather add an &quot;other scandals&quot; section than stick Lewis back in there.  The &quot;relapse&quot; scandals go to the heart of the assertion that conversion therapy is ineffective.  The section as it is, lacking Lewis, makes that point much more strongly.  The documented abuses suffered by those undergoing convesion therapy speak to the assertion that it is fundamentally rooted in homophobia, and a source of oppression rather than psychological help. Adding &quot;bare facts&quot; to sections that don't really mesh well weakens the argument made in those sections.  Hence, I'd favor splitting Lewis out into an &quot;other scandals&quot; section--except that he'd look kind of lonely there, and beg the question why he wouldn't be in with the abusers... since his only separating characteristic is that his victim was not a minor.  Does that make sense? Actually, I've sufficiently convinced myself, I think I'm going to put it back in that section.

== Reparative therapy versus conversion therapy ==

Recently, an editor called 66.30.20.71‎ has been going through articles and changing &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to &quot;conversion therapy.&quot; In a few cases, this may be correct, but in most of the cases the editor has done this, it is a serious error. 66.30.20.71‎ has already been cautioned on his talk page about this by two editors, one of them me. 66.30.20.71‎ has tried to justify his editing by pointing to the article on conversion therapy, saying that it does not say that reparative therapy is only one kind of conversion therapy. The reason why the article didn't say that is because 66.30.20.71‎ had changed it. I have changed it back, and it is now correct. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 04:31, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

I gather that 66.30.20.71‎ had a problem with Warren Throckmorton being used as a source, but there's no question that Throckmorton is correct. His article usefully points out a common and serious error, and it would be extremely regrettable if this article is going to be edited in a way that perpetuates the mistake Throckmorton exposed. Please, before anyone decides to change this, find a source suggesting that Throckmorton is wrong. Absent such a source, there's no justification for changing the article back again. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 04:34, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

66.30.20.71‎ wrote this in the article, '[[Warren Throckmorton]] distinguishes what he calls &quot;reparative therapy&quot; from his own method, which he refers to as [[Sexual Identity Therapy]].' The source referred to cannot justify this claim; &quot;reparative therapy&quot; ''is not Throckmorton's term'', so the words 'what he calls &quot;reparative therapy&quot;' do not make sense here. They falsely imply that it is Throckmorton in particular who is responsible for this term, but he didn't coin the expression &quot;reparative therapy&quot;; as Throckmorton points out, the person chiefly responsible for it was Elizabeth Moberly. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 04:51, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

I urge other editors to investigate this situation and undo 66.30.20.71‎'s changing of &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to &quot;conversion therapy&quot; when it is a mistake, which it usually is. I suggest that text visible only while editing be put into these articles to discourage other editors from making the same mistake.

== Recent edit by Jokestress ==

Without any prior discussion, Jokestress recently added a large amount of information about transgender issues to this article. It is unclear to me that this was the correct decision, or that this material was properly integrated with existing material. After all, the article reads, 'Today's conversion therapists characterize the movement as offering the possibility of a choice to people who are unhappy with their attraction to the same sex.' That statement is sourced to an article that defines reparative and conversion therapies as being about sexual preference only, not gender identity. If this is correct, then it doesn't make sense to say that conversion therapy is also about transgender issues, which do not necessarily involve homosexuality. Just on that basis alone, I think there is a case for reverting the edits made by Jokestress. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:59, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
:The problem is that this sort of therapy is not used just for sexual orientation, and in some cases therapy for gender variance has been implemented in hopes of preventing homosexuality. The problem is not the additional material, which is all reliably sourced to clinical publications, but the article's bias toward sexual orientation therapies. I agree that the place I put the new material could be discussed, but the article itself focuses primarily on just one of the kinds of therapy. In fact, a case can be made that most conversion therapy is done (especially on children) not because they are gay, but because they '''act''' gay, which is gender identity and expression. There's plenty more info on reparative therapy for gender-variant youth. I am open to discussion. By the way, I am not sure why we are using &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and not &quot;reparative therapy&quot; (which is what I usually see used. [[User:Jokestress|Jokestress]] ([[User talk:Jokestress|talk]]) 06:16, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
:Even granted that the material you added should be in the article at all, you should have thought more carefully about how to add it. It looks plain silly for the article to say both that conversion therapy is about both changing sexual preference and gender identity issues ''and'' that 'conversion therapists characterize the movement as offering the possibility of a choice to people who are unhappy with their attraction to the same sex.' [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 07:15, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
::Those aren't necessarily contradictory statements, if that's what you mean. How would you propose we synthesize both uses of the term? A section for each - GID and homosexuality? [[User:Jokestress|Jokestress]] ([[User talk:Jokestress|talk]]) 07:43, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
::The two statements obviously look contradictory. One asserts that conversion therapy is about both of two different things. The other asserts that it is about only one of those things. Even if the statements didn't ''look'' contradictory, there would still be the problem that the article links to a source that contradicts the material you added.

::And then there's this, in the article, 'According to a response released by American Psychiatric Association, Zucker does not advocate reparative therapy for transgender adults or for trans youth in all cases, and he opposes change therapy for gays under all circumstances: &quot;For all patients, regardless of age, the focus of therapy is the patient's gender identity, not the patient's sexual orientation. Dr. Zucker's therapeutic approach has no relationship to so-called reparative or sexual conversion therapies that attempt to change homosexual orientations to heterosexual ones.&quot;' Given the last part of that statement, I wonder whether this material isn't a questionable addition to the article? [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 07:54, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
::A further oddity is that this quote from Zucker seems to be sourced to an article that does not contain it (and spare us the confusions between the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association). That particular mistake gave me all the reason I needed to remove that material. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:37, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

Jokestress' large and inappropriate addition is an attempt to use this page for her own sociopolitical agenda.  Jokestress has recently started re-accusing [[Kenneth Zucker]] and others of conducting reparative therapy.  Zucker pointed out in a statement that this was untrue (he works with GID kids and not people who are trying not to be gay).  It thus became of interest to Jokestress to expand the definition of &quot;reparative/conversion therapy&quot; to include trans-, so that those terms would to make her prior accusations about Zucker less incorrect.  

You will notice that her large edit contains ''no'' reference supporting her revisionist definition of reparative/conversion therapy.

I believe this is a gross abuse of wikipedia and that Jokestress should not be permitted to edit on pages related to the issue.&lt;br/&gt;

== Throckmorton ==

In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=221686818&amp;oldid=221636651 this edit series], I changed the two sentences in the article.  Previously, they read:

:Sometimes ''reparative therapy'' is misleadingly used synonymously with ''conversion therapy'', though in fact it is only one type of conversion therapy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;What is RT&quot; /&gt;

I found this assertion curious, as the article itself is called &quot;[[Conversion therapy]]&quot;; and the article itself makes no such distinction.  I visited the reference for this statement, and determined that the person who presented this definition as was [[Warren Throckmorton]].  I determined that this reference (Throckmorton's [[WP:SELFPUB|self-published]] website) is not sufficient to claim the &quot;facts&quot; about this definition, particularly considering that the article used to be called &quot;Reparative therapy&quot;, but is now called &quot;Conversion therapy&quot;: apparently, at some point there was a consensus so clear that it allowed the title of the article to be changed.  These were the circumstances under which I attributed this opinion to the person who held it.  With my changes, the sentences read: 

:[[Warren Throckmorton]] distinguishes what he calls &quot;reparative therapy&quot; from his own method, which he refers to as [[Sexual Identity Therapy]].  Throckmorton argues that it is erroneous to use &quot;reparative therapy&quot; as an umbrella term, suggesting instead the use of the phrase &quot;reorientation therapy&quot;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=plainlinks&gt;[[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 1]][[http://wthrockmorton.blogspot.com/2005/07/love-in-action-on-good-morning-america.html 2]][[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=183 3]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[User:Skoojal]]'s response to this was to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=221801357&amp;oldid=221720769 revert] immediately; stating: &quot;undoing edit that introduced serious error into the article, and which is being used to justify errors in other articles - Throckmorton was correct&quot;.  

Currently, we have three self-published sources, all from one person, making an assertion that is not supported elsewhere in this article.  In the absence of material which would suggest that Throckmorton's view is widely accepted, we should attribute the opinion to the person who holds it.

Incidentally: in ''none'' of the sources (including the original) does Throckmorton state anything about &quot;conversion therapy&quot; being an umbrella term, with &quot;reparative therapy&quot; being one form of conversion therapy among many.  In fact, none of the sources mention the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; at all.  Throckmorton does not present &quot;reparative therapy&quot; as a type of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;; he doesn't even use the latter term.  Thus, the assertion that Skoojal made, above, remains unsourced.  [[Special:Contributions/66.30.20.71|66.30.20.71]] ([[User talk:66.30.20.71|talk]]) 11:49, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

:Excuse me, but the fact that this article is called &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; means nothing in itself. Articles are called what Wikipedia editors decide they should be called, which may or may not be for good reasons. Past supposed &quot;consensus&quot; proves nothing about the rights or wrongs of the issue. Furthermore, past versions of the article did indeed make this distinction, so 66.30.20.71's claim is false. The only reason why the article did not make the distinction was because 66.30.20.71 edited it that way. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:53, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:66.30.20.71's choice of words implied that Throckmorton is the person mainly responsible for the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, or even the ''only'' the person who uses the term, which is a serious misrepresentation of the facts, and nothing more than 66.30.20.71's opinion. Throckmorton is a widely known writer, with a record of published work, who has tried to take a middle ground position in the controversies in this area. He clearly knows what he is talking about; 66.30.20.71 does not. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:04, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:Since this article generally uses &quot;conversion therapy&quot; in the same way that Throckmorton uses the term &quot;reorientation counselling&quot;, it is perfectly legitimate to use him as a source. The article may need to be rewritten somewhat, but not in the way that 66.30.20.71 rewrote it, which presents nothing more than &lt;s&gt;his or her&lt;/s&gt; mistaken personal opinion.

===Use of self-published source===
Hi, I'm 66.30.20.71.  One of the problems I see with [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]]'s recent edits is that Skoojal is basing zir edits upon a [[WP:SELFPUB|self-published]] source. This self-published source is an essay titled &quot;[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 What is reparative therapy?]&quot;, written by [[Warren Throckmorton]] and published by Throckmorton on his own website, www.drthrockmorton.com. As we see in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=221994371&amp;oldid=221880117 this edit] to [[Conversion therapy]], Skoojal references the essay as a factual source.

The official [[WP:SELFPUB|Wikipedia policy on self-published sources]] clearly states: 

&quot;Self-published and questionable sources '''may only be used as sources about themselves''', and '''only if it is not [[Wiktionary:contentious|contentious]]'''.&quot;  

[[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] is using Throckmorton's self-published source as the basis for a large number of edits, in which ze claims that &quot;reparative therapy&quot; is only one kind of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;; apparently in accordance with Throckmorton's views.

The edit summaries of these 35 edits make it clear that Skoojal is interested to promote Throckmorton's definition of the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; throughout Wikipedia: in them, Skoojal makes the following statements:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Nicolosi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=220930529 undoing edit that made the article less accurate - Nicolosi practices reparative therapy specifically; conversion therapy can include numerous \different things]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Nicolosi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=220931423 rewording to make it clear that reparative therapy and conversion therapy are not the same thing]

Skoojal refers to this usage of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; as &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christine_Bakke&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=221371249 dangerously vague]&quot;, and as &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=221369797 a common and serious mistake]&quot;.

Since this usage of the self-published source is '''contentious'''; the self-published source must not be used to justify these types of edits.  

In addition to failing to provide verifiable third-party sources for these edits, I feel that Skoojal's edits represent defiance of the consensus which led to change this article's title from [[Reparative therapy]] to [[Conversion therapy]].  Clearly, at some point, editors agreed that the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; was a synonym for &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, and that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; is preferable.  

The [[American Psychological Association]], in [http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html Answers to Your Questions For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation &amp; Homosexuality], writes: 
: ''To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy) is safe or effective.''

The [[American Psychiatric Association]], in [http://archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf Position Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies)], uses &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; as synonyms, but places the word &quot;reparative&quot; in quotes ((perhaps as [[scare quotes]]), whenever it is used.

To recap:

# The source is '''self-published''', it must not be used as a primary source.
# The usage of this self-published source is '''contentious''', it must not be used.
# There is an existing '''consensus''' to regard &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; as synonyms, and to prefer the former as more neutral.
# There are multiple '''reliable sources''' indicating that this is the case.

In my opinion, any rebuttal to this statement should include several [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that indicate 1) that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; is an umbrella term containing &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, and 2) what other forms of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, beyond &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, exist.  The rebuttal should also indicate why we should prefer these sources over 1) the usage preferred by the editors who came to a consensus to rename this article [[Conversion therapy]], and 2) the usage preferred by the American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association.

: 'Clearly, at some point, editors agreed that the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; was a synonym for &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, and that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; is preferable.' This is not a serious argument. The fact that Wikipedia editors decided that something was appropriate does not mean that it actually was appropriate. Furthermore, it is not the case that the use of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; as the title of this article means that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; are somehow synonyms. The &quot;conversion therapy&quot; article itself has pointed out, in some versions of it, that this is not the case. Warren Throckmorton is a widely known writer with a history of published work in this area, and it is appropriate to use him as a source. That &quot;reparative therapy&quot; refers to a specific kind of therapy to change sexual orientation and not an umbrella term for all sorts of different therapies is simply the truth. Whistling42's edits are disruptive and tendentious. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:47, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:The source from the American Psychological Association says, 'To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy) is safe or effective.' This does not mean that 'reparative therapy' and 'conversion therapy' actually are synonyms, just that some people use them that way. Again, that's not good enough. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:28, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:The source from the American Psychiatric Association does not specifically state that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; mean the same thing, and thus it cannot be used to show that they do. That article, incidentally, is tendentious. It implies that ''Sigmund Freud'' was a reparative therapist. Not exactly. Freud is not on record as having ever called himself a &quot;reparative therapist&quot;; the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; was not used until long after Freud's death. In any case, as the conversion therapy article makes clear, Freud thought that therapy to change sexual orientation was a waste of time in most cases. Note that this source, when it says, 'The theories of &quot;reparative&quot; therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both (10-15)', refers only to sources influenced by psychoanalysis. Thus it cannot make sense to apply the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to refer to methods of changing sexual orientation that have nothing to do with psychoanalysis, such as aversion therapy. These are based on totally different assumptions about what causes homosexuality. This source is obviously using the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; very loosely; it doesn't offer a real definition. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:47, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

::Then maybe our whole definition of conversion therapy is off.  The article currently states it can include anything to either eliminate or diminish homosexual desires, including &quot;behavior modification, aversion therapy, psychoanalysis, prayer, and religious counseling.&quot;  I never liked the idea that simply praying has now become some kind of psychoanalytic therapy.  According to my understanding, the term reparative therapy stems from a theory that homosexual desires stem from a lack of same-sex bonding in early childhood, hence the homosexual tries to ''repair'' the deficiency.    The Just the Facts pamphlet states &quot;The most important fact about these “therapies” is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. ...Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations.&quot;  This makes it seem that they are directing their comments at therapies that view a homosexual orientation as a mental disorder.  Hence therapies such as sexual identity therapy, gender wholeness therapy, context specific therapy, don't fall under the APA definition of reparative therapy.  We need a separate term for them.  Using conversion therapy for all therapies aimed at reducing homosexual desires and using reparative therapy for all therapies based on the theory that homosexuality is caused by some sort reparative drive has been very convenient.  If it is decided these two terms are synonymous, then the gender affirmative therapies which definitely aren't reparative therapies need to go to another page.

::It appears that the way these terms are defined, and what counts as an acceptable source for their definition, has never been properly resolved. Quite often, any method of changing sexual orientation is described as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, but this is definitely misleading. Reparative therapy, as Joshua says, is a specific kind of therapy, based on specific ideas about the development of homosexuality that other therapies do not necessarily share. Any attempt to use it as a general term for changing sexual orientation (or to equate it with sexual identity therapy) has to be resisted. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:43, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

::The apparent suggestion that prayer, all by itself, counts as a form of converison therapy certainly looks misleading.

===Removal of unsourced statement===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=222649109&amp;oldid=222606959 Removed] the following statement from the article: &quot;Sometimes ''reparative therapy'' is misleadingly used synonymously with ''reorientation counselling''.&quot;  The sources given were two self-published sources on &quot;drthrockmorton.com&quot;, and are still inappropriate for anything other than to verify ''their own'' existence (i.e. &quot;Warren Throckmorton self-published this statement.&quot;).  Until such time as JoshuaJohnson's suggestion comes to pass (that a determination is made about the various forms of therapy and what they are), we must not rely on self-published sources to prove a point; doing so violates Wikipedia policy.  For this reason, I have also reverted three similar edits which seek to make the same (unsourced) distinction: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Association_for_Research_%26_Therapy_of_Homosexuality&amp;diff=222649289&amp;oldid=222213024 one] to [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Nicolosi&amp;diff=222649222&amp;oldid=222178895 one] to [[Joseph Nicolosi]], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Wayne_Peterson&amp;diff=222649157&amp;oldid=222406908 one] to [[Brian Wayne Peterson]].  [[User:Whistling42|Whistling42]] ([[User talk:Whistling42|talk]]) 12:58, 30 June 2008 (UTC)
:The APA has definitely defined reparative therapy as being based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness or inherently inferior.  In your opinion what should we do with therapy aimed at reducing homosexual behavior or attractions but that is not based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness?  One of my thoughts would be to change the intro to say &quot;Reparative therapy is a type of pyschotherapy used to treat [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] based on the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness or inherently inferior.&quot;  We would then move the list of the different therapies aimed at reducing homosexual desires to the ego-dystonic sexual orientation page, separating reparative therapy from the other ones.  This would avoid the debate on which definition of conversion therapy to use.  Much of the article, such as the debate on whether sexual orientation can be changed through therapy, would then need to be moved to the ego-dystonic sexual orientation page. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 18:56, 30 June 2008 (UTC)
:The recent edits made by Whistling42 are without justification. Joseph Nicolosi has identified himself as a practitioner of reparative therapy. This is a good enough reason for identifying Nicolosi as a reparative therapist. Similarly, NARTH are well known as advocates specifically of reparative therapy, and the article about them should say as much. The sources of the article about But I'm a Cheerleader refer to reparative therapy, thus the article about Peterson should also use the expression reparative therapy. Whistling42 seems to think that the expression ''reparative therapy'' must never be used on Wikipedia, but has never given a good reason for this stance.

:The problem with the suggestion that Joshua makes is that the article by the American Psychiatric Association, without offering a real definition of &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, all but equates it with classical psychoanalysis, which is most misleading. Reparative therapy is influenced by psychoanalytic ideas, but it is certainly not one and the same thing as classical psychoanalysis. If Whistling42's argument were correct, then one could edit the article about Sigmund Freud to make it say that Freud was a reparative therapist, something which would be a terrible distortion of the facts and which I am sure would be swiftly reverted. The article from the American Psychological Association does not actually say that conversion therapy and reparative therapy are the same thing, or always refer to the same thing, only that these terms are sometimes used that way.

===Removal of inappropriately sourced statement===
Once again, I have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;action=submit removed] the use of self-published sources per official Wikipedia policy, [[WP:SELFPUB]], which states: &quot;Self-published and questionable sources may only be used as sources about themselves, and only if it [the material] is not contentious.&quot; This usage fails on both counts.  The usage also fails per [[WP:SPS]], which states that personal websites are largely not acceptable as sources.  I have also removed the use of a Wikipedia article as a source, again per [[WP:SPS]].  Thirdly, I have removed repetetive wikilinks per [[WP:MOS]].  [[User:Whistling42|Whistling42]] ([[User talk:Whistling42|talk]]) 01:27, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
:Your removal of that link was a mistake. I restored it. You will note that I have rewritten that passage, pointing out that it expresses Throckmorton's view (and it happens to be a correct view, though I haven't stated that in the article). Your attempt to hide the fact that reparative therapy is a specific kind of therapy does a disservice to readers of the article. It is interesting that you have never removed the words &quot;The label reparative originated in 1983 when research psychologist Elizabeth Moberly coined the term reparative drive to refer to male homosexuality itself, interpreting men's sexual desires for other men as attempts to compensate for a lacked connection between father and son during childhood&quot;, because just by itself this shows that reparative therapy is a specific kind of therapy, and not an umbrella term for all attempts at changing sexual orientation. So long as those words are there, you are not proving anything by removing the term ''reparative therapy'' from the introduction. Obviously the term ''reparative'' cannot apply to all attempts at changing sexual orientation if it wasn't even used until 1983. The article definitely needs to be rewritten to make matters clearer; sensible suggestions about how would be welcomed. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:37, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

No one has ever seriously questioned this, including the two APA (American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association) sources.

== Reparative therapy for gender variance ==

Two editors have raised objections about expanding this article to include all forms of reparative therapy, including gender identity and expression. Here are a few salient quotations: 

*Laura Dean et al. (Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, 2000): &quot;An extreme example is found in 'reparative' therapy, which seeks to reverse sexual orientation or gender identification, an approach that may lead to increased self-hatred and mental health problems (Ryan, Bradford, &amp; Honnold, 1999).&quot;

*Darryl Hill et al. (Haworth 2006): &quot;Zucker and Bradley believe that reparative treatments (encouraging the child to accept their natal sex and associated gender) can be therapeutic for several reasons. They believe that treatment can reduce social ostracism by helping gender non-conforming children mix more readily with same sex peers and prevent long-term psychopathological development (1.e., it is easier to change a child than a society intolerant of gender diversity). Reparative therapy is believed to reduce the chances of adult GID (i.e., transsexualism) which Zucker and Bradley characterize as undesirable.&quot;

* Simon Pickstone-Taylor (Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2003). &quot;What Bradley and Zucker (1997) suggest for treatment is something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals.&quot;

In other words, there are lots of sources indicating that reparative therapy is not limited to sexual orientation. I feel the article should reflect this. Please provide any reasons why you feel it shouldn't, so we can discuss the ways to proceed. [[User:Jokestress|Jokestress]] ([[User talk:Jokestress|talk]]) 16:08, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

:Remarkable claims require remarkable support, and your references remain disturbingly poor.  The Dean reference is a self-published report from an activist organization; the second reference is from Hayworth which publishes about everything they're paid to (it's not on par with the university presses mentioned in WP:RS), and Pickstone-Taylor's statement that they think the things are ''close'' necessarily means that they also think they are different.

The [[intelligent design]] movement objects to being labeled [[creationism]], but the fact remains that some people have published work noting the connections. This debate seems similar. Of course those who promote prevention of transsexualism do not want to be associated with reparative therapy and will object to the connection, but Wikipedia is supposed to present a neutral account of any topic.

== Introduction needs to be modified ==

The introduction to the article reads, 'Conversion therapy refers to methods aimed at changing a person with primarily homosexual attractions to heterosexual, or at eliminating or diminishing homosexual desires and behaviors. Many techniques have been tried, including behavior modification, aversion therapy, psychoanalysis, prayer, and religious counseling. Conversion therapy is closely associated with the &quot;ex-gay&quot; movement, which is more explicitly religious.'

This needs to be modified to make it clear that reparative therapy is a specific method that has been used to change sexual orientation, and that it is the method most associated with the ex-gay movement. I suggest that the introduction be rewritten as follows: 'Conversion therapy refers to methods aimed at changing a person with primarily homosexual attractions to heterosexual, or at eliminating or diminishing homosexual desires and behaviors. Many techniques have been tried, including behavior modification, aversion therapy, reparative therapy, psychoanalysis, prayer, and religious counseling. Reparative therapy is closely associated with the &quot;ex-gay&quot; movement, which is more explicitly religious.' [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 04:00, 28 June 2008 (UTC)


===outside view===
I've just looked briefly at the sources, but it seems quite obvious that the terminology is being used in the profession in more than one way. Definition One  considers reparative therapy an approximate synonym for conversion therapy, and Definition Two considers it a specialised subtype--an older subtype, referring specifically to a psychoanalytically-based method.  I am not yet clear who uses it which way, but I think the APA establishment, which deprecates conversion theory in general, does not make much distinction between the various forms. The psychologists allied with groups that have some connection with conservative Christianity, which promotes conversion therapy to at least a certain extent, tends to make the differentiation--presumably in order to distinguish their newer methods which they think more sophisticated in terms of an understand of the social as well as the psychological significance of homosexuality and free  from what many consider the theoretical baggage of psychoanalysis.   
:The only way I see to edit in a situation like this is to be up-front about the different meaning, giving the definitions that support one, and the definitions that support the other. How they are used is, unlike their therapeutic merits, not the province of peer-reviewed papers but of usage. I think that to document one school of thought or one individual's view, a definition from the person or group's official website is a perfectly reasonable way of doing it--every bit as good as from one of their published works. Care needs to be taken to give a good definition--not one extracted from a longer passage if possible, but one that is explicitly set forth a being a definition. This avoid the problems of quoting out of context. We are not competent to describe what &quot;conversion theory&quot; properly meaqns, just what it is said to mean. The views of the person introducing the term defines how ''he'' originally used it, but it might well be used differently by others, in which case his view would be of mostly historical interest. 
:I don't see this a question of majority and fringe viewpoints--I see it as multiple schools of thought, which must each be explained in its own terms. I don't think it altogether impossible that schools of thought in subjects like this may deliberately choose terminology intended to convey a certain effect, and make use of the implications of words as they think it will be seen by others--this requires especial care in quoting and explaining. 
:Remember that the purpose of Wikipedia is not to tell the reader whether or not therapy aimed at reversing homosexuality  either as practice or orientation is appropriate, is effective, is ethical, is necessary, is the majority viewpoint, is the scientific approach. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present the information objectively, and if the interpretations differ, to give them fairly.    There is a place for persuasion, and for writing aimed at demonstrating the correctness of a position, but it is not at Wikipedia.

:I see no fundamental problem with using several different sources, explaining why each source use the term in the way it does, but the fact that one particular group of people (reparative therapists) originally defined what they do as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, and that they do not consider other kinds of change therapies &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, has to be made clear. &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; is only used as a general term for attempts at changing sexual orientation by groups that oppose such attempts; its practitioners never use it that way, because it would mean (for instance) that their theories would be confused with altogether different things, such as aversion therapy. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:56, 28 June 2008 (UTC)
:Additionally, I think that reparative therapy deserves its own article since it is often (and more correctly) understood to be a specific kind of therapy, and not simply a synonym for &quot;conversion therapy&quot; in general.

Some of the relevant past discussions are archived here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Conversion_therapy&amp;oldid=172747269#Conversion_therapy_vs_Reparative_therapy]]. Back in October 2007, in response to a request by [[User:Fireplace]], the Reparative therapy article was moved to Conversion therapy. This was defended on such questionable grounds as 'Both terms refer to the same phenomenon' and 'Today, &quot;conversion therapy&quot; and &quot;reparative therapy&quot; are generally treated synonymously in the literature' (to quote [[User:Fireplace]]) and that because reparative therapists 'are marginal in their own field of clinical psychology' what they call themselves is not 'particularly important' (to quote [[User:Dybryd]]). I do not think that this issue was dealt with properly. There is no problem with saying that ''sometimes'' the term reparative therapy is used as a general term for methods of changing sexual orientation, but there is a very big problem with suggesting that this usage is the one correct one. That creates confusion, and has lead to the attempt by [[User:Whistling42]] to expunge the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; from Wikipedia.

I reverted a series of major changes by [[::User:Skoojal|Skoojal]]&amp;nbsp;([[::User talk:Skoojal|talk]]&amp;nbsp;'''·''' [[::Special:Contributions/Skoojal|contribs]]), who purged the article of &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; and replaced with &quot;homosexual&quot; and who has made accusations of NPOVness about at least one other editor objecting to the change. &quot;Homosexual&quot; is becoming recognized as a derogatory term among gays and lesbians. From [http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php?PHPSESSID=866af2ee8b87a4bfb7e4d889c8fb918f|GLADD]: &quot;Offensive Terminology to Avoid: Please use &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;gay man&quot; to describe people attracted to members of the same sex.&quot; Skoojal claimed that reverting away from &quot;homosexual&quot; was just &quot;political correctness&quot;, but this is incorrect. Per [[Wikipedia:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Terminology must be neutral. Derogatory terms are not to be tolerated in a category name under any circumstances, and should be added to the list of speedy deletion criteria. Note that neutral terminology is not necessarily the most common term — '''a term that the person or their cultural group does not accept for themselves is not neutral even if it remains the most widely used term among outsiders.'''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is therefore clear that WP guidelines indicate that the most appropriate terms to use are &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian.&quot; [[User:Eaolson|eaolson]] ([[User talk:Eaolson|talk]]) 23:28, 12 May 2008 (UTC)
:The term 'homosexual' is not derogatory, whatever some gays and lesbians may think (other gays, including me, don't have a problem with it). 'Homosexual' is a neutral and accurate term for people attracted to the same sex, just as heterosexual is a neutral and accurate term for people attracted to the opposite sex (and I note that eaolson isn't objecting to 'heterosexual' or complaining that it is somehow derogatory, which logically it should be if 'homosexual' is bad). There is no reason why this article has to use what one particular homosexual organization considers appropriate language: GLAAD does not speak for the homosexual 'cultural group' as a whole.

*First, I disagree with your statement that if &quot;homosexual&quot; is offensive then &quot;heterosexual&quot; must therefore also be derogatory. If political groups start using &quot;heterosexual&quot; to make straight people sound clinically disordered, then I might agree. If you can show me a major straight-rights advocacy group asking that the term not be used, I'll have no objection to &quot;heterosexual&quot; being changed to &quot;straight.&quot; In fact, I don't really have any objection anyway. Descriptive adjectives for the majority group are very rarely derogatory, mainly because they are in the majority, the &quot;normal&quot; group.
:The question isn't whether the word is inaccurate. Words have connotations and we should be sensitive to them, just how &quot;Eskimo&quot; isn't used on Wikipedia, regardless of its accuracy. You won't find many people objecting to &quot;Caucasian&quot; but I'd be very careful using the clinical term &quot;Negroid&quot; if I were you. 
:Simply put, &quot;homosexual&quot; isn't generally how the gay and lesbian community describes itself. As examples:
:# GLADD. Self-evident from the fact they request the media not use the term. (see above)
:# [http://advocate.com/index.asp Advocate.com]: Describes itself as the &quot;award-winning '''LGBT''' news site.&quot;
:# [http://www.hrc.org/about_us/what_we_do.asp Human Rights Campaign]: &quot;...the largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for '''gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender''' Americans...&quot;
:# [http://www.sldn.org/templates/about/index.html?section=87 Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]: lists among its goals, &quot;Lift the ban preventing '''gays, lesbians and bisexuals''' from serving openly and honestly in the military.&quot;

:# [http://www.logoonline.com/about/ Logo]: the new '''lesbian &amp; gay''' network from MTV Networks
:Those are just examples I pulled entirely at random from all the major gay and lesbian media and web presences I could quickly think of. I didn't cherry-pick; I couldn't actually find a ''single'' use of the word &quot;homosexual.&quot;
:Your claim that &quot;GLAAD does not speak for the homosexual 'cultural group' as a whole&quot; is an impossible to meet standard, as there can never be a group that speaks for the whole of any cultural group whether it centers on race, religion, or sexual orientation. And it's not just one group. As far as I can tell, it's basically every media presence, with the exception of some obviously conservatives ones like WorldNetDaily that can't even use the term &quot;gay&quot; without putting it in scare quotes. From our very own article [[Terminology of homosexuality#Currently prescribed usage]]:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Same-sex oriented people seldom apply these terms to themselves, and public officials and agencies often avoid them... The Guardian Style Guide, Newswatch Diversity Style Guide, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, and the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concern of the American Psychological Association's Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language agree that &quot;gay&quot; is the preferred term... People with a same-gender sexual orientation generally prefer the terms gay, lesbian and bisexual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::Some factual knowledge about the history of the word 'homosexual' may be helpful here. There's a good article about this by Jim Burroway over at the Box Turtle Bulletin website http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/page/2. It describes how the word 'homosexual' was coined by Karl-Maria Kertbeny, an early supporter of what is now often called gay rights, as a neutral term to describe people sexually attracted to their own sex.
:::The term 'homosexual' is standardly used in scholarly and academic discussion of people who are attracted to the same sex, which it certainly would not be if it were derogatory. It is used this way by both supporters and opponents of the gay movement. The fact that some gay groups think that the word 'homosexual' is derogatory does not make this true. They may happen not to like the word 'homosexual', or even be uncomfortable with it, but that's an entirely different matter.

This remains an issue wherein the terminology on articles should only be changed through [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]].

:::'There has to be a consensus' is an argument one can always resort to if one has nothing better.

::* [edit conflict, in response to Skoojal] Yes, and in the early days of the gay rights movement the term &quot;homophile&quot; was used. We don't use it anymore. The word &quot;fairy&quot; was used in a non-insulting way in the 1920s. We don't use that one anymore, either. I'm not saying &quot;homosexual&quot; was inappropriate for the 19th century. I'm not saying it's inaccurate, I'm just saying it's not the preferred usage.  Terms change. The very ''reason'' &quot;homosexual&quot; is not preferred is that it is unnecessarily clinical. Go take a look at [http://americansfortruth.com/ Americans for Truth about Homosexuality] or [http://www.pathinfo.org/index2.htm Positive Alternatives to Homosexualty]. One thing you'll ''never'' find there is the word &quot;gay&quot; used, it's always &quot;homosexual&quot; this and &quot;homosexual&quot; that. That's not a coincidence. That's a very intentional use of a clinical word to imply some sort of disorder.

::&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gay guy, the use of the word homosexual is downright messed up. The word homosexual is now often considered derogatory by gays, partly because the word is used incessantly by the religious right for the express purpose of denigrating gays (the word can sound dirty and clinical). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[User:Eaolson|eaolson]] ([[User talk:Eaolson|talk]]) 01:30, 14 May 2008 (UTC)
::Your use of the word 'we' suggests that all homosexuals agree that the word 'homosexual' should not be used. This is not true. Remember that I'm a homosexual and I don't agree with you. The fact that most homosexuals do not prefer the word 'homosexual' does not make it either derogatory or insulting and is not a valid reason for not using it. The fact that the words 'homosexual' and 'heterosexual' are clinical is what makes them appropriate to an article about a scientific subject. Insisting on politically correct rather than scientifically correct language is a violation of neutral point of view.

::Incidentally, you aren't describing accurately the changes I made - I did not remove all uses of the word gay from the article. Not only did I not remove it from direct quotes, which unquestionably would have been wrong, I also did not remove several other instances of the word (in one case, I removed it, but on further reflection decided that I shouldn't have done that and put it back in again). I accept that it may be appropriate within certain contexts, eg to describe gay affirmative therapy. It just shouldn't be used in general.

::Another point. There is a substantial group of homosexuals who generally don't want to be called 'gay.' These are homosexuals who regard homosexuality as wrong and want to change their orientation. Why should their feelings and sensitivities count for less than those of homosexuals who are happy being homosexual?

[outdent]While &quot;homosexual&quot; is a perfectly fine word in the right context, I disagree that the terms &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; imply a particularly pro-gay viewpoint. I think you're saying that the use of &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;lesbian&quot; (as opposed to &quot;homosexual&quot;) necessarily implies POV in support of gay rights. If that were true, then politicians couldn't say they were opposed to ''gay'' marriage; religious leaders couldn't say that ''lesbians'' are sinful; psychologists couldn't claim that ''gays'' and ''lesbians'' are capable of reversing their sexual orientation. &quot;Gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; are, simply, the ''human'' terms for men and woman--[[Human|H. s. sapiens]] males and females--who are endowed with homosexual orientation. The word &quot;homosexual&quot; is not equivalent; it can be used to describe, for instance, the behavior of a [[Bonobo]] chimpanzee during a certain time of day. &quot;Homosexual&quot; as an adjective describes a specific behavior; as a noun, it sometimes applies to a particular sociocultural niche. However, when referring to individuals, it is correct to use &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian.&quot;
In discussing, say, bull-on-bull mounting behavior, it is just as imprecise to describe the cattle as &quot;gay&quot; as it is to say that, for instance, the people who moved in across the street are &quot;a homosexual couple.&quot; [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 09:55, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

:Sorry.  I did not mean to be offensive.  By gay lifestyle I meant people who were either in sexual relationships with people of their own gender or pursuing said relationships.  Just because your gay doesn't mean you have what is commonly termed in conservative circles as a gay lifestyle.  People who have ceased pursuing homosexual relationships often refer to it as a lifestyle change.  I shouldn't have used the term gay lifestyle, but I honestly forget it is offensive and it is sometimes easier than saying pursuing gay relationships.  I will make more of an effort to avoid such a term in the future.  Is there another term that is less offensive to refer to people who pursue sexual relationships with people of their gender?

::::::The most equitable solution is to use the term &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; in the same way in which its heterosexual counterpart might be used. That is, anytime it would be natural to describe a straight person as living &quot;a heterosexual lifestyle,&quot; it would make sense to apply the equivalent term to a homosexual. As Joshuajohanson says, the term &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; applies to non-celibate homosexuals. If &quot;heterosexual lifestyle&quot; or &quot;straight lifestyle&quot; were commonly used in reference to non-celibate heterosexuals, this usage would make perfect sense. This is not the case, however--which renders the term meaningless in general discourse. 

::::::The terms &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;heterosexual,&quot; when applied to an adult individual, are normally understood to imply that the individual engages, or is inclined to engage, in sexual and/or romantic relationships ''exclusively with members of the opposite sex.'' To make it understood that a heterosexual individual chooses to abstain from sex, the term &quot;celibate&quot; is used; otherwise the reader/listener assumes the possibility of a sex life. Similarly, when describing someone who is &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;homosexual,&quot; the implication is that the individual engages, or is inclined to engage, in sexual and/or romantic relationships ''exclusively with members of the same sex.'' Therefore, to communicate the fact that such an individual is celibate, one must say so.

::::::In mainstream culture, celibacy among adults is rather unusual regardless of sexual orientation, so people naturally assume the presence of a normal sex life unless otherwise indicated. If you wish to say that a person abstains from sex, the only clear way to do so is by using the term &quot;celibate&quot;--or say, if you must, that he or she leads &quot;a celibate lifestyle.&quot; [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 08:20, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

==Removed factual error==

An older version of this article wrote that the label reparative originated in 1983, and that it was coined by Elizabeth Moberly. This is quite misleading; the word ''reparative'' was used in numerous different contexts before then (eg, in the work of Melanie Klein), so I have changed this part. The entire paragraph of which that sentence was the start was worded misleadingly. It needs further improvement, and so do other parts of the article.

== Therapy for GIDC ==

I have just started an article on [[gender identity disorder in children]], which is back in the news following announcements about the DSM-V committee appointments on gender issues. The controversy centers on [[Kenneth Zucker]], who advocates therapy in children to prevent adult gender identity disorder (transsexualism). Some previously-mentioned quotations:

*Kenneth Zucker (Canadian Journal of Psychiatry (1990). &quot;Two short term goals have been discussed in the literature: the reduction or elimination of social ostracism and conflict, and the alleviation of underlying or associated psychopathology. Longer term goals have focused on the prevention of transsexualism and/or homosexuality.&quot;

*Simon Pickstone-Taylor (Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2003). &quot;What Bradley and Zucker (1997) suggest for treatment is something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals.&quot;

*Darryl Hill et al. (Haworth 2006): &quot;Zucker and Bradley believe that reparative treatments (encouraging the child to accept their natal sex and associated gender) can be therapeutic for several reasons. They believe that treatment can reduce social ostracism by helping gender non-conforming children mix more readily with same sex peers and prevent long-term psychopathological development (1.e., it is easier to change a child than a society intolerant of gender diversity). Reparative therapy is believed to reduce the chances of adult GID (i.e., transsexualism) which Zucker and Bradley characterize as undesirable.&quot;

The &quot;prevention of transsexualism and/or homosexuality&quot; indicates that the literature doesn't make a clear distinction between interventions for altering gender identity and sexual orientation. Zucker wishes to distance his own techniques from reparative therapy because he does not advocate preventing homosexuality, just transsexualism. I feel this should be mentioned here in a section above &quot;New psychoanalytic models and Reparative Therapy.&quot; GIDC was formalized as a diagnosis in 1980, though attempts to cure childhood identity disorder predate that diagnosis. The proposed section will be in summary style with a link to the main article GIDC. Wikipedia should include all reliably-sourced uses of the terms &quot;reparative therapy,&quot; &quot;conversion therapy,&quot; &quot;change therapy,&quot; etc. [[User:Jokestress|Jokestress]] ([[User talk:Jokestress|talk]]) 16:41, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

:Only people who are not themselves reparative therapists use the expression ''reparative therapy'' in this loose and general way. Self-proclaimed reparative therapists always use the term to refer to a specific kind of therapy. The article should not leave anyone in any doubt about this. Your proposed addition would probably confuse matters. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:52, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

== More possible inaccuracies in the seciton &quot;New psychoanalytic models and Reparative Therapy&quot; ==

The article reads, 'In 1983 research psychologist Elizabeth Moberly coined the term reparative drive to refer to male homosexuality itself, interpreting men's sexual desires for other men as attempts to compensate for a lacked connection between father and son during childhood.' Now, in his book ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'', Nicolosi says this: 'In the psychoanalytic literature, homosexuality has long been explained as an attempt to &quot;repair&quot; a deficit in masculine identity. This theory is not new; in fact, it has a long tradition within the psychoanalytic literature. While not all homosexuality can be explained simply as reparative drive, for most homosexual men it is a significant motivation. When the homosexual encounters another man who is what he himself would like to be, he is likely to idealize him and romanticize the relationship. Reparative-drive theory began with Sigmund Freud (1914), who linked homosexuality to narcissism: &quot;A man can love himself as he is, he can love himself as he was, he can love someone who was once a part of himself, and he can love what he himself would like to be&quot; (p. 90).' That's from pages 70 and 71, in the section 'Homosexuality as a Reparative Drive.' Now if this is true, then the article's claims perhaps look misleading. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:20, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

On page 72 of that book, Nicolosi attributes the reparative drive explanation of homosexuality to Anna Freud, Sandor Rado, and Lionel Ovesey, all of whom wrote well before Elizabeth Moberly. Nicolosi identifies Moberly's contribution as the idea of defensive detachment (p. 19-20), not the reparative explanation of homosexuality. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:22, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

Also, it seems that the term reparative drive is used to ''explain'' homosexuality, not as a ''term for'' homosexuality, as the wording of that section implies. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:23, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

== Inappropriate Quotation ==

This article contains the following quotation from Joseph Nicolosi: 'Each one of us, man and woman alike, is driven by the power of romantic love. These infatuations gain their power from the unconscious drive to become a complete human being. In heterosexuals, it is the drive to bring together the male-female polarity through the longing for the other-than me. But in homosexuals, it is the attempt to fulfill a deficit in wholeness of one’s original gender.' The section of ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' that this is taken from is about 'The Limitations of Homosexual Love', and is not primarily about what causes homosexuality. I suggest that this quotation be removed and replaced with something more suitable. The following from page xvi might be better: 'In reality, the homosexual condition is a developmental problem - and one that often results from early problems between father and son. Heterosexual development necessitates the support and cooperation of both parents as the boy disidentifies from mother and identifies with father. Failure in relationship with father may result in failure to internalize male gender-identity. A large proportion of the men seen in psychotherapy for treatment of homosexuality fit this developmental syndrome.' This is much less colorful than the other quotation, and that's part of the reason I'm suggesting it (I have made some related comments on the Joseph Nicolosi talk page, questioning the usefulness and appropriateness of using out of context quotations as a way of explaining someone's theories).

== Rethink on Statement sourced to Throckmorton ==

I recently added the words, 'The term reparative therapy is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for conversion therapy in general', to the introduction. So long as this explanation is allowed to remain in the introduction, I no longer think that the statement sourced to Warren Throckmorton needs to be in the article. It might arguably be better placed in the article on Throckmorton. It may seem ironic that I have now removed this myself, having several times re-inserted it, but after some reconsideration I think the sentence I have placed in the introduction is a clearer way of explaining things; hopefully it will also be less contentious. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:14, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

== Recent Addition to the Article by Whistling 42 ==

Recently, the following sentence was added to the article: 'In Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders' Media Reference Guide, editors list the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; under Problematic Terminology, stating: &quot;In reporting, the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; should be avoided whenever possible (except in quoted material), as it insinuates that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are 'disordered' or 'broken' and need to be 'repaired'.&quot;' This statement is wrong. It is perfectly obvious that it is the ''theories'' of the reparative therapists that 'insinuate' this, and emphatically not the use of the expression ''reparative therapy'' itself, which is the name of a particular kind of therapy. No one is supporting the theories of the reparative therapists simply by using the expression ''reparative therapy'', and it is silly to suggest otherwise. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 07:18, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

: This assumes that those who coined the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; did so in good faith, rather than out of a desire to provide political cover for opponents of gay and lesbian rights, who base their opposition on claims that homosexuality is a &quot;choice.&quot; After exposure to widespread ridicule, it became popular for the model's proponents to characterize it as politically value-neutral, with the sole aim of assisting clients genuinely troubled by their sexual orientation. I believe people's objection to the term, however, is that, if the model truly were value-neutral, why would its proponents have chosen a loaded term like &quot;reparative,&quot; which clearly presumes that homosexuals are somehow &quot;broken&quot;? 

: I don't know whether the term should necessarily be banned, however. Recent euphemisms for reparative therapy only serve to cover up its political motivations, so from that standpoint, I say let its proponents call it &quot;reparative&quot; if they wish to reveal their spurious conviction that being gay or lesbian is some kind of psychological flaw which must be repaired. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 10:34, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

:In general, reparative therapists do not assume that homosexuality is a choice, so the first sentence of your post above seems misleading.

Hi Skoojal,  Hi Joshuajohanson,

It's easier to reply to you both in one post - no disrespect meant.

I don't see how pseudoscience is 'dubious and poorly defined' above.  I quoted the American Heritage Dictionary, which is generally regarded as a good source for definitions.  Here are 2 more concurring definitions from reliable sources:
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pseudoscientific Merriam Webster]
[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudoscience Free Dictionary]

I had written a longer reply based on the article before you made your most recent edits, so I will have to re-read the relevant parts and examine further the sources you reference before re-examining the pseudoscience idea.

As for my change to the lede, I was trying to make things clear, not make it POV or confusing.  Your edit has odd syntax - heterosexual as a noun doesn't work in that instance.  Surely &quot;identifying&quot; as homosexual isn't POV?  If anything it covers LGBT ideas on identity *and* religious/ex-gay/other beliefs about choice... I've clarified the syntax and added the 'identify' bit.

I'm not sure if the edit summery by Skoojal (&quot;undoing edit - this article is already too long and you want to expand it even further? the article needs the reverse of this! see talk&quot;) was meant for me... just to clarify, I didn't make the edit you were reverting.

[[User:Conmalone|Conor]] ([[User talk:Conmalone|talk]]) 00:57, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

Joshuajohanson,

After reading your newly edited version of the Medical Consensus paragraph, I have to ask you if you actually read any of the sources that you reference?  The original summary that you charged was &quot;biased&quot; was actually far more reflective of the sources.  The APA statement, for example, is unequivocally against conversion therapy, e.g. their [http://archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf conclusion] reads:
''&quot;Therefore, the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot;''

You claimed the paragraph you edited was biased and then went on to remove a paraphrase of the following Am Psych Assoc [http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.html#whatabout quotation]:
''&quot;To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy) is safe or effective. Furthermore, it seems likely that the promotion of change therapies reinforces stereotypes and contributes to a negative climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons.&quot;''
This refutes your anti-pseudoscience arguments.  Why did you remove this?

The oft-quoted ''&quot;Mental health professional organizations call on their members to respect a person’s (client’s) right to selfdetermination; be sensitive to the client’s race, culture, ethnicity, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, language, and disability status when working with that client; and eliminate biases based on these factors.&quot;'', when actually read in context, does not give psychologists leeway to perform CT.

''The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American School Counselor Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of SocialWorkers, together representing more than 480,000 mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus is not something that needs to or can be “cured.”''

If you look down through the other information about CT in the rest of the world, the consensus is similar to that in the US.

:The quote &quot;the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot; means just that, any psychiatric treatment which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.  Not all conversion therapies are based on that assumption.  I left in &quot;All major U.S. mental health organizations have expressed concerns about such practices.&quot;  I'm not arguing that.  Expressing concern is not the same as labeling it a pseudoscience.  There is no adequate scientific evidence that it is safe or effective, but there is also no adequate scientific evidence that it is unsafe or ineffective.  No evidence means no evidence.  The reason the quote was biased was because it only showed one side, not because it was wrong.  The quote you bring up also only shows one side.  I have read the sources extensively and it does talk about that there is no conclusive evidence one way or the other, where the original summary made it seem as if there was conclusive evidence that it isn't safe.  I think CT in Europe and Canada are similar to the US, but not the rest of the world. You say the wording is that their position &quot;does not give psychologists leeway to perform CT.&quot;  That is simply wrong.  The fact of the matter is that they are given leeway.  Every psychologist practicing conversion therapy under [[NARTH]] is accredited with one of these major psychological associations, including [[Joseph Nicolosi]].

:Skoojal, if sexual identity therapy isn't a type of conversion therapy, what is it?  I thought it just wasn't a type of reparative therapy. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 08:10, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

::The important part of that quote is: &quot;or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot;  What do conversion therapies focus on?  Everything I've read (here and otherwise), including review after review by groups like the APA, indicates that conversion therapy works on the basis of someone trying to change sexuality based on the idea that they should.

::You're treating the consensus paragraph as if its purpose is now to prove/disprove the pseudoscience tag, whereas its job is to give a fair and concise overview of the consensus.  If you like you can separate out the ideas country-by-country, but please be careful not to suggest that the US consensus is not overwhelmingly against all forms of CT.  It can be considered represntative unless you have good sources to back up the claim to the contrary.  If you can show that other countries/organizations outside of North America/Europe view CT positively then please add it to the consensus section. [[User:Conmalone|Conor]] ([[User talk:Conmalone|talk]]) 08:23, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

:::That is where the self-determination argument comes in.  Conversion therapy as practiced under the license of these medical associations is based on the idea that the client wants to change or diminish sexual orientation. Not that they should, just that they want to.  That is a huge difference.  The wording of the 1998 APA declaration is that &quot;the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot;  Yet, even with this firm opposition, they stated &quot;The American Psychiatric Association does not currently have a formal position statement on treatments that attempt to change a persons sexual orientation.&quot;  Those are two different things.  You can't confuse the two.  If the APA and the ACA outright opposed all forms of conversion therapy, they wouldn't produce ethical guidelines to follow when practicing conversion therapy.  Read the ethics guidelines section. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 10:07, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

== Reverting my edits ==

Skoojal,

Please give better reasons for reverting my referenced edits other than them being too long.  I'm trying to refine syntax and grammar so that the lede is actually coherent.  I added the vice-versa bit because conversion therapy is also used in theory for ego-dystonic sexuality disorders, per ICD-10.  My additions to the consensus only seem to be causing you trouble because you and one other editor disagree with what the (well-sourced) material wrote - when it was LONGER and used references incorrectly ye didn't seem to have any problems with it.

Please discuss any further problems here; I had the patience to avoid an edit war over the pseudoscience tag, so reciprocity would be appreciated.

Thanks, [[User:Conmalone|Conor]] ([[User talk:Conmalone|talk]]) 01:53, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
:To suggest that conversion therapy is used to convert heterosexuals to homosexuality is ''completely ridiculous''. That is simply not what the term means. If you reword the article so that it says this, I'll undo it. Dictionary definitions of complex concepts don't impress me. There isn't even full agreement on what science is, much less what pseudo-science is. I note that one of those definitions was that pseudo-science is something that pretends to be based on science but is not. This is a completely different issue from what therapies are safe or effective and what are not, which is what is under discussion.[[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:13, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

::As I said above, I'd rather avoid an edit war so I've backed off on the pseudoscience tag to consider it further.  With respect, I've taken a step back even though I've simply been adhering to the top 3 sections of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Graham%27s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.jpg Graham's hierarchy].  Please try not to call edits &quot;ridiculous&quot;, etc., when they are referenced and in good faith.

::I'm sure you're as keen for compromise as I am and we don't want to infringe 3RR, so how about &quot;and, in theory, vice-versa&quot;?  Have you read the ICD-10 link I posted?  It notes that edo dystonia applies to all sexual identities.  I think it would be clear the way I've suggested but we could add a clause mentioning that it is almost exclusively LGB-oriented.

::If something is ridiculous, it's ridiculous. Even if you do have a source that defines &quot;conversion therapy&quot; as including changing heterosexuality to homosexuality, which I will check, it's still absurd and misleading to put this in the article, because that simply is not how the term is usually used. So I reject your compromise. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 04:55, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

You indicated that you considered the wording of the Medical Consensus paragraph the most important part of the dispute. I agree, and am open to further discussion about that issue.

==Cultural references section - borders on trivia==

I think the first sentence of the 'cultural references' section, 'Conversion therapy and the ex-gay phenomenon occasionally appear in popular culture, usually in a satirical or skeptical context' has its place in the article, but I think the rest is either trivial or borders on trivia, and could perhaps be removed. Comments? [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:02, 23 July 2008 (UTC)

:If there are no responses or objections soon, I am going to remove most of the cultural references section, which in my view is trivia. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:59, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

::I don't see any reason to remove it: the material is well referenced and interesting; it's a discrete and short section; it does not constitute trivia, nor does it break any policies or rules in the MOS that I'm aware of.  So that would be a very strong vote to keep. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 08:10, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

::&quot;Interesting&quot; is not a good reason by itself for keeping something in an article. What some film maker thinks about conversion therapy may show us something about the film maker, but it shows us nothing about conversion therapy itself - and that is what the article is about. Such material would be more appropriate to other articles, and I am still inclined to remove it, especially since this article is too long. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:10, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

:::Indenting with one extra colon beneath the last post would make it much easier to distinguish and read your responses.  Instead of &quot;interesting&quot; I should have said &quot;relevant&quot;.  Your effort to pare down the article is commendable, but there is plenty of excess material that could be removed before the cultural references section.  As I said, it's a short section, it's well referenced and it relates directly to the subject of the article.  Unless you can prove that it directly breaches some policy or can suggest an article to which it is more appropriate then it ought to stay put. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 09:29, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

::::I feel strongly that this section should be removed, or at least greatly reduced in size. It is a compilation of trivia that shows nothing significant. The general point that conversion therapy has been referred to in popular culture can be made in one sentence, without having to mention the various ways it has been mentioned (in some cases, such as the movie But I'm a Cheerleader, these already have their own articles). Besides being unimportant, having it there suggests that somehow the views of conversion therapy of people who produce comedies and movies actually matter - which they don't. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:52, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

:::::It is really a very short section so I cannot see how it could be &quot;greatly reduced in size&quot; without removing it altogether.  It is not a compilation of trivia - trivia are unrelated facts whereas these facts all pertain to pop culture references.  While you may not view it as important, I think that it is.  The section gives the reader an impression of how popular culture views conversion therapy.  CT is a relatively rarely used therapy that is supported by a small minority of psychologists and religious groups and yet it has garnered considerable attention from mainstream media/entertainment - I think that's significant in itself.  It's important for people to see how the world understands (or misunderstands, depending on your point of view) CT and how it is portrayed outside of the academic/clninical setting.  As I mentioned above - and indeed in my post below - there are far longer sections that could be edited or moved to make space in the article without scarificing this section. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 12:55, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

:::::It is trivia in the sense of being unimportant; I will remove most of it. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 11:55, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

Skoojal, just a friendly reminder that unilateral decisions are not favoured on wikipedia.  You need to give very good reasons for removing verifiable material other than just claiming that the stuff is &quot;unimportant&quot; in your own estimation.  Pop culture references are widely accepted as valid sections in wikipedia articles and, as I mentioned, can provide valuable insights into how an issue is perceived by/portrayed to the general public.  You have failed to provide a just argument for removing the section and doing so would indeed make me worry about ownership issues. Respectfully, [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 14:15, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

:I have discussed this on the talk page. The reasons you are giving for keeping the pop culture trivia are without exception bad reasons. One single sentence is all that this needs - it's not important what one episode of South Park said about Conversion therapy, and it's silly to suggest that it is. This is a problem of undue weight. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:25, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

::If the section were particularly long I would likely agree with you that it should be cut down, but it is a short and pertinent section in my opinion.  The reasons I have given (while open to debate) are well thought-out and clearly explained while you have yet to refer to a single policy or precedence on wikipedia which suggests that such a section should be removed.  On the other hand, I can point to ''entire articles'' on pop culture references to a particular subject... surely this indicates that cultural references can be noteworthy.  Wikipedia is not all about article lengths and rules - we need to provide a big picture of the topic and I think that the section in question is valuable in that regard.  By the way, I commend your effort to remove much of the ex-gay material; that move has made a fair dent in the length of the article. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 01:36, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

::The actual details of what South Park said about Conversion therapy (or even the fact that it said anything about it) are definitely not pertinent. This is a problem of undue weight, and I will look up the policy and quote it here if need be. As with telling us the details of how many children a particular ex-gay has, it's tacky and irrelevant. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:39, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

Skoojal, if you read my previous comment, I was COMMENDING you for your edits to the ex-gay section; i.e. I was giving you a compliment.  I am still troubled by your edits though: why have you edited the cultural references section without finding consensus?  What is the point in having a discussion on a talkpage if you go ahead and do what you want regardless?  All of our opinions are equally valid here.  You are editing and making reverts unilaterally - that's not good etiquette.  Please revert your edit to the cultural references section and continue the discussion here. Thanks, [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 01:45, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:GeneralBelly, I am not going to restore that section, and the reason is this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE#Undue_weight]. Part of it reads, 'An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject.' Mentioning South Park at all in an article on Conversion therapy violates this, since it has no significance here (although the fact of popular culture in general refering to conversion therapy is worth maybe one sentence). [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:03, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:I'll note that while you're complaining about my removing that, SCBC has indicated that doing so is a good idea - while simultaneously adding more of the kind of irrelevant details about the lives of ex-gays that you agree with me shouldn't be there. There seems to be a need for more extensive discussion about what kind of material is appropriate. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:14, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

Skoojal, you have really frayed my wikinerves and have convinced me that you have serious ownership issues with this article.  I don't agree with your undue weight argument - it was a short, short, short section that did not change the weighting of the article; in fact, undue weight is only abstractly related to the issue at all.  Have you read [[Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles]]?  I am not trying to force my opinions on you or anyone else, but you aren't displaying any desire to reason with me or compromise or even ''reach consensus''.  Your reasons for reverting my edits also keep changing (note that '''you have reverted every single edit I have ever made to this article''' and have begun edit wars to keep it that way).  I'd urge you to re-evaluate your approach to editing this article and allow others to have some wiggleroom.  Perhaps I'm naive, but I have never experienced such closed editing of an article.  I am taking a wikibreak solely because your stubborn editing is stopping me from contributing to this article.  I'm keen to help you pare it down to a more concise version, but you are pushing your own ideas far too strongly.  If this gives you some sense of victory, then I hope it's worth it.  See you after my wikibreak; hopefully you will be in a more co-operative mood. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 02:29, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:It seems people are accusing me of trying to own pretty much every article I work on seriously. It's never been my intention. Undue weight was a good reason for removing the material - even a short mention of South Park treats it more seriously than it deserves. Another relevant policy that everyone should try observing is civility [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility]. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:57, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

::I think people may indeed get the wrong idea about you sometimes - I personally believe you have good intentions.  But I do think that if a number of editors are suggesting that you have owenership issues then they may not all be wrong.  I would be dismayed if you were even hinting that I wasn't being civil.  If you read over all of my comments, I have gone out of my way to be complimentary and genial towards you, even when you have been curt, made unilateral reverts without consensus, labelled my edits &quot;ridiculous&quot; and accused me of complaining.  You are not an easy editor to work with and I've tried to reach out to you as a collaborator but you seem to prefer me as some form of foil.

== Conversion Therapy Disagreement ==

Before I comment, I need to make a few points clear.
*#I personally am heterosexual.
*#I do, however, have a close relative who is, to avoid prejudging the issue, of the alternative orientation, and of course as a medical practitioner I come across all orientations. So I have no personal bias.
*#I am not a member of [[WP:ARBCOM]], and have no standing in wikipedia except that of being and admin of some experience.

Having said that, then it appears to me that the points at issue are susceptible to rational analysis.
*#The dispute over the exact description to be applied to those men or woman whose primary sexual orientation is to members of their own sex seems to me to reflect changing historical usage in association with changing views in society on sexual orientations which differ from what is at the time the accepted norm. When the word &quot;homosexual&quot; was first used, it was used in a clinical sense to label a condition which was at that time believed to be a physical or psychological abnormality, and this reflected the general feeling of society at the time. Homosexuality was, of course, a criminal act punishable by imprisonment in this country (UK) and, I believe most other countries in what is called the developed world. This perjorative odour contained in the word homosexual has lingered into the modern era, and hence I believe that people who are labelled &quot;homosexual&quot; still feel, and to some extent are, labelled thereby as being in some ill-defined way as inferior or unsavoury. Hence the development of the use of the term &quot;gay&quot;, which is a recent artificial construct which lacks the outmoded connotations of the old term. Incidentally, in the UK the term gay can be applied to ladies also, and therefore to some extent overlaps the term &quot;lesbian&quot;, which descends from Greek mythology but which appears to have avoided being used to stigmatise ladies whose sexual orientation is to their own sex. In summsry, it is my view that the terms &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;lesbian&quot; should be used in the article except in direct quotations from published work. 
*#The term pseudo-science should, i feel, be used only with extreme caution and only when there is a very clear consensus in favour of its usage. It is true that there are a number of clear dictionary definitions of the term, but the assignment of the term to any discipline must, by definition, be a matter of opinion. A believer's science is a sceptic's pseudo-science. I get the impression that there are enough people who accept the validity of the technique of conversion therapy to disqualify the use of the term pseudo-science.
*#I do not interpret the reference quoted as indicating that conversion therapy is used, or is designed to be used, to convert heterosexual to homosexual orientation.
*#The Medical Consensus paragraph, which forms a major part of the argument, seems to me in my naïive to be the most straightforward to resolve. If the dispute relates to the exact wording, then the wording is clearly available and can be directly documented. And should be. Interpretations and paraphrases may convey the meaning of the original, and I think that essentially they do, but changing the wording in any way, particularly on a contraversial subject, is bound to cause dissent and should be avoided.
This is, I think, the best I can do. I claim impartiality - I do not recall ever interacting with the main protagonists here - but not specific expertise. If you do not agree, please remember that I comment only because I was asked to.--&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;[[User:Anthony.bradbury|'''Anthony.bradbury''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Anthony.bradbury|&quot;talk&quot;]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:07, 24 July 2008 (UTC)

== New &quot;History of Conversion Therapy&quot; article? ==

Would it make sense to condense the history of CT into a single, concise summary paragraph and move the bulk of the material to a new article that could be referenced beneath the History of CT section? That would open up a lot of space. [[User:GeneralBelly|GeneralBelly]] ([[User talk:GeneralBelly|talk]]) 09:35, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== Removed Gratuitous Information about Ex-Gays ==

I have removed a huge amount of information about ex-gays from the article, on the grounds that the level of detail was irrelevant and gratuitous (telling us how many children someone has is not helpful, and it could be considered intrusive). In any case, this stuff overlapped with biography articles, which is where it really belongs, not here, in an article that's still too long. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== Picture of John Paulk ==

I'm not going to move it right away, however, I suggest that the picture of John Paulk would be more appropriate for the article on him. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:35, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== Bioenergetics ==

There's a description of Richard Cohen's therapy: 'He holds male patients in his lap with the patient curled into the fetal position, and also advocates bioenergetic methods involving slamming a pillow with a tennis racket while shouting &quot;Mom! Why did you do this to me?&quot;' I don't think that this is either a fair or a fully accurate description of what Cohen does. It implies that Cohen thinks that each and every patient should always behave in this exact way and say those exact words; I don't think this is true, and I certainly don't think that one video clip from CNN proves that this is the case.

:I used a briefer and more fair description, though as I said, it will need more reworking. I have strong doubts as to whether a video clip from CNN is a good source - one of Cohen's books would be vastly better, as well as more scholarly (for what it's worth, I find this similar to other poor uses of sources in the article, including the way that a book by Socarides was used to support a description of what 'today's conversion therapists' think, even though Socarides was speaking only for himself, the way a paper by Mark Yarhouse and Warren Throckmorton was used to support a similar general claim even though its authors were again only speaking for themselves, and the way a website from Exodus International was used to support a broad claim about ex-gay groups, even though that organization was again only giving its own position, which wasn't described quite correctly).

== Removal of self-determination ==

The statement &quot;However, the organizations respect the client's right to self-determination&quot; was removed from the  Medical consensus section with the summary &quot;it is not logical to follow a statement about how organizations respect the client's right to self-determination with a statement about how this has marginalized conversion therapy.&quot;  The statement about it being marginalized comes from, not a psychologist, but from the gay rights activist [[Kenji Yoshino]].  Why is his view that it is marginalized overpower the official view that organizations respect the client's right to self-determination?  According to the APA, &quot;the ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of therapies that seek to reduce or eliminate same-gender sexual orientation are under extensive debate in the professional literature and the popular media&quot; [http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html]  It is POV just to show one side of the debate and remove the official stance. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:36, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

:I stand by the reason I gave for removing that. That sentence, in that context, seemed to imply that the fact that organizations respect the client's right to self-determination (eg, the right to choose conversion therapy if that is what they want) has somehow helped to marginalize conversion therapy, which is nonsense. If it had any consequence, supporting the right to choose conversion therapy would probably help encourage it, and not, obviously, to marginalize it. There is no contradiction between organizations respecting people's right to choose conversion therapy and its being marginalized - it ''is'' marginalized, even though people can choose it, and even though the APA says that the ethics etc of it are debated. So please remove the neutrality disputed tag, and the citation needed tag too. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:22, 16 August 2008 (UTC)

::Do not remove the NPOV tag until the section is presented neutrally.  Patients have the right to self-determination.  The text must reflect that before you remove the tag.

::As far as I'm concerned, the section is neutral. Insisting that it is not neutral is not a useful contribution to discussion. I've pointed out already that there is no contradiction between Yoshino's statement and official views, which do not say that conversion therapy isn't marginalized. Your comment above makes no attempt to respond to this. If you have a problem with that section, then I suggest that you delete it entirely. I'll probably delete it anyway, since essentially the same information is present in another section of the article. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:18, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

== 'History' section of this article doesn't seem to make sense ==


The History section of the article starts off with this, 'The development of conversion therapy can be roughly divided into three periods: an early Freudian period, a period of mainstream approval of conversion therapy during a time when the mental health establishment became the &quot;primary superintendent&quot; of sexuality, and a post-Stonewall period wherein the mainstream medical profession disavowed conversion therapy.' However, the article then divides the history of Conversion therapy into five periods, only one of which, Post-stonewall reaction, seems to correspond to the three periods mentioned in that sentence. The first of these five periods is called Early Sexologists, and it starts in 1886, which is before the Freudians, thus contradicting the sentence that the History section begins with. This obviously makes no sense, and has to be changed. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:38, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

:Looking through this article, it seems clear that Yoshino is frequently used as an unacknowledged source.

== Omission: conversion therapy for heterosexual -&gt; homosexual?   ==

From the introductory section: &quot;Conversion therapy refers to methods aimed at changing the sexual orientation of homosexuals and bisexuals to heterosexual&quot;

It may be a bit pedantic, but in the interest of completeness it seems that, if the aim of conversion therapy is to convert human sexual orientation, there should be some material available also on methods which seek to change heterosexual orientation to homosexual or bisexual. If not, then &quot;conversion&quot; itself doesn't seem to be the aim, but &quot;heterosexuality conditioning.&quot; The term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; may therefore mislead the naive reader, so it bears mentioning explicitly that little research has been conducted regarding conversion from heterosexual to homosexual. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 09:51, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

:Are there any extant societies that pressure people to be gay? [[User:Capedia|Capedia]] ([[User talk:Capedia|talk]]) 21:32, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

::Seems dubious to me. Very [[WP:OR]]. --[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] ([[User talk:Knulclunk|talk]]) 02:02, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

:::You can see from the discussions above that this nonsense has already been discussed. The term conversion therapy is not used to describe therapeutic attempts to convert heterosexuals to homosexuality, and no such attempts are on record. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:23, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

Regarding [[User:Conmalone|Conor]]'s comments above--which, yes, are patent nonsense--I am agreeing with [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] that conversion therapists seek exclusively to change their clients' homosexual orientation to a heterosexual one. That is the point exactly; nobody ever attempts to &quot;convert&quot; heterosexuals to homosexuals. 

Today, the discipline of conversion therapy is free of any suggestion that heterosexuality is superior or preferable, in any objective sense, to homosexuality. Such judgments are taken only on a case-by-case basis; practitioners act from a sense of compassion using a therapeutic model whose efficacy can be backed up with scientific findings. (For instance, see A. Dean Byrd's cited statement that individuals who, through therapy, learn to &quot;understand their gender development&quot; become &quot;able to make choices that are consistent with their value system.&quot;) 

The stated goal of reparative therapy is not to force gays to assume unnatural societal roles simply for the sake of assuaging unhealthy fears of wrongheaded anti-gay bigotry. As cited, therapists merely offer &quot;a possibility of change&quot; to clients who are &quot;unsatisfied&quot; with their sexual orientation. Since no preference is given to heterosexuality, a reader may well conclude that homosexuals and heterosexuals alike who are thus &quot;unsatisfied&quot; might have the opportunity to seek relief through reparative therapy. 

However, as [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] has pointed out, this is not the case. No conversion therapist has been willing to help, for instance, a heterosexual who (for whatever reason) feels that a homosexual orientation would be more consistent with his/her value system. (Such cases must be rare, but as students of psychology, we must recognize that the kaleidoscope of human experience, sooner or later, offers up every exigency.) 

As all have pointed out, there is little or no research regarding heterosexual-to-homosexual conversion therapy. This absence, then, does not constitute [[WP:OR | original research]], but demonstrably serves to uniquely characterize the state of reparative therapy. Flatly, reparative therapy ''does not seek to convert heterosexual orientation to homosexual orientation.'' What reason could there be to exclude such a clarification from the article?

Consider this factual statement: &quot;Conversion research has focused on the development of therapeutic models which seek to change homosexual orientation to heterosexual orientation. There has been virtually no research regarding the conversion of heterosexuals to homosexuals.&quot; This agrees entirely with [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]]'s statement that &quot;no such attempts are on record.&quot; So, no controversy. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 08:14, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

:::The reason for excluding that clarification from the article is that it is not needed. No one thinks that conversion therapy is used to convert heterosexuals to homosexuality. The definition of conversion therapy (eg, methods of converting homosexuals to heterosexuality) is clear enough, so I undid your edit. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 10:03, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

::The statement: ''&quot;There has been virtually no research regarding the conversion of heterosexuals&quot;'' '''is''' [[WP:OR|original research]], but even more importantly, the relevance of the statement is OR as well. Is there a large body of work debating whether straight -&gt; gay conversion should be studied more? Have there been studies linking peer pressure gay, [[prison gay]] or [[Lesbian until graduation|LUG]] to conversion therapy?  Seems to me we are just pulling stuff off the shelf. Unless we have [[WP:RS|reliables sources]] that link Rangergordon's theory/observation with conversion therapy, it cannot be included.--[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] ([[User talk:Knulclunk|talk]]) 15:10, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

::::[[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]]'s statement that &quot;No one thinks that conversion therapy is used to convert heterosexuals to homosexuality&quot; is every bit as OR as anything I've stated--and, in fact, is really just a restatement of my argument. Nobody ''has'' questioned whether or not &quot;conversion&quot; works both ways--a curious omission in a field which claims to be scientific. The point is that the therapy is called &quot;conversion,&quot; with no explicit modifier explaining that, in this particular case, the &quot;conversion&quot; is from heterosexual to homosexual ''only''. 

::::Obviously, the answer that [[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] intends to elicit from his rhetorical question &quot;Is there a large body of work debating whether straight -&gt; gay conversion should be studied more?&quot; is that, no, there is no such body. This is precisely my point. The fact that this &quot;large body of work&quot; does not exist--in other words, that such a fundamental scientific hypothesis has never been tested--significantly characterizes the field of conversion therapy. Nobody even ''thought'' to research this obvious question, since &quot;conversion&quot; is not central to the field, but &quot;conversion ''from homosexuality to heterosexuality''.&quot; &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; is a misnomer. This bears mentioning. 

::::As both have argued, the most savvy readers will certainly be aware of these issues and automatically assume without being told that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; likely refers to the conversion of gays to straights. However, an encyclopedic article seeks to define its subject as accurately and narrowly as possible. Once it begins to make assumptions such as &quot;Oh, most readers will think ''this''&quot; or &quot;Let's not bother mentioning ''this''--the readers can figure ''that'' out,&quot; the article ceases to be encyclopedic, limits its own usefulness and, in making the assumption that every reader holds a particular point of view, becomes very much [[WP:POV]]. Too bad. [[User:Rangergordon|Rangergordon]] ([[User talk:Rangergordon|talk]]) 09:33, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

:::::I think the definition of conversion therapy given in the article is clear enough, and doesn't need further elaboration. I certainly don't see it as a POV issue. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 22:29, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

::::::It seems unlikely that we will reach consensus on this issue. It is remarkable to me that a discipline known as &quot;''conversion'' therapy&quot; ignores serious research that could determine whether human sexual orientation can be arbitrarily converted. That this fact, apparently, is unremarkable to Skoojal must simply boil down to a difference in opinion. But, since Skoojal seems to have some sort of proprietary ownership of this article, I guess there's little more I can do beyond registering my dissent.

::::::::I'm assuming good faith in that you're not ''purposefully'' missing the point, and that you must simply be confusing  &quot;evidence&quot; with &quot;research.&quot; 

::::::::Like you, I'm unaware of any &quot;evidence&quot; that sexual orientation can be changed from straight to gay. (I'm equally unaware of any &quot;evidence&quot; that it ''cannot.'') However, we're not discussing the existence or lack of ''evidence''--we're discussing the existence or lack of ''research'' on the matter. The absence of evidence, either for or against the proposition, is due to a paucity of research on the matter.

::::::::If the field were truly concerned with whether or not sexual orientation can be converted as a matter of objective scientific inquiry, then we would expect to find ''some'' amount of research regarding straight-to-gay conversion. Two reasons have so far been given for the absence of that research: 1. There is no market demand for straight-to-gay conversion, and, 2. It stands to reason that nobody could be converted from straight to gay and so no research is needed. 

::::::::If 1. is true, then conversion therapy is market-driven, which makes it a commercial enterprise rather than a field of scientific inquiry. If 2. is true, then conversion therapy is based on an undemonstrated assumption that heterosexuality is, objectively, a preferable state to homosexuality, regardless of a client's circumstances.

==I will tidy up my edits - I promise==

You'll note that I've removed a lot of material from this article recently. I'm confident that most of these changes are improvements, but I'm afraid that in the course of making them, I've probably inadvertently removed a few of the sources the article is based on. I'll go through old versions of the article and readd anything of that kind that got removed by mistake, unless someone gets there before me.

==Use of Robert Kronemeyer as a source==

Several claims about conversion therapy in the article are sourced to Robert Kronemeyer's book ''Overcoming Homosexuality''. Specifically, the claims that overiectomy, castration, vasectomy and lobotomy were used to treat homosexuality are sourced to that book. I find this to be yet another example of poor sourcing (Kronemeyer's book is an anti-gay tract, not a history of medicine, and it doesn't even have a proper bibliography or index). Kronemeyer's book should be replaced as a source with something more suitable. Simon LeVay's ''Queer Science'' should do. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:22, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

== Aesthetic Realism ==

[[Aesthetic Realism]] should be included in the history section. The New York City-based group  promoted itself as a provider of conversion therapy in the &lt;s&gt;1960s and&lt;/s&gt; 1970s &lt;u&gt;and 1980s&lt;/u&gt;. (Perhaps ironically, it believed men could be cured of homosexuality by studying poetry.)

:Well, I partly agree. There might be a case for including Aesthetic Realism in the history section, if this wasn't a bloated monster of an article that clearly needs to be cut back. Personally, I'd like to add a mention of Arthur Janov's primal therapy to the article, which is a subject of considerably greater importance than Aesthetic Realism, but I'm not going to do that for the moment, because the article is just too long.

== Some recent edits ==

SCBC made several edits to the article. I think most of these changes are improvements - but I'm unsure about some of them. One of the edits changed the article from 'Some in the ex-gay community believe that sexual orientation cannot be completely changed, but others disagree' to 'Many in the ex-gay community believe that sexual orientation can be completely changed, while others indicate that complete change may not be realistic'. This amounts to a shift of emphasis rather than anything else - it could be argued that both statements were correct - but I still think it's dubious whether that can be justified. More argument would have to be given first (incidentally, the reason I gave for undoing that edit - why try to conceal disagreement within the ex-gay camp? - now seems wrong to me, since I've taken a closer look at it, but I still think undoing the edit was right). [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:10, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

Another thing I am unsure about was the addition of this link br.geocities.com/amigosdafamiliabr/14_2Clevenger.doc. I'm not sure whether this counts as a reliable source or not. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 03:26, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

On your first point, I thought that the existing sentence made the proposition that &quot;some in the ex-gay community believe that sexual orientation cannot be completely changed&quot; appear to be a widely-held view within ex-gay circles, despite the fact that the only citation offered was a cite to a comment made by Alan Chambers in an interview.  If anyone is aware of other ex-gay individuals or organizations that hold a similar perspective, please feel free to add some footnotes.  I thought it was more accurate to state the majority ex-gay perspective (i.e. that sexual orientation can be completely changed) first -- citing to a variety of organizations that have expressed that view -- and to then make reference to Mr. Chambers' views.  On your second point, I can understand your concern about that source.  I have not been able to find a comparable source for the same proposition, so I deleted the sentence relating to bias against pro-conversion-therapy studies in academia.  Hope that helps.

== Definition of Conversion Therapy in this article is original research ==

The article reads, 'Conversion therapy refers to methods aimed at changing the sexual orientation of homosexuals and bisexuals to heterosexual, or at eliminating or diminishing homosexual desires and behaviors.' It seems clear to me that the sources in the article (especially the statements from the two APAs) do not justify this statement. There is a serious problem here that is going need a lot of work. I am going to say much more about this after I've investigated a little further.[[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:34, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

An example of the problems involved in this definition: The American Psychological Association source says, &quot;To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy) is safe or effective.&quot;

Note that,

1. this definition of Conversion therapy does ''not'' correspond to that given in this article, eg, &quot;Conversion therapy refers to methods aimed at changing the sexual orientation of homosexuals and bisexuals to heterosexual, or at eliminating or diminishing homosexual desires and behaviors&quot; - that definition implies that any ''method'' (therapy or not) of changing sexual orientation is Conversion therapy, but the APA definition only says that ''therapy'' counts as Conversion therapy.

2. &quot;eliminating or diminishing homosexual desires and behaviors&quot; is not part of the APA's definition, even though it is part of the definition given in the article.

3. those who have been insisting (apparently ridiculously) that conversion therapy is ''any'' attempt at changing sexual orientation, not just changing it from homosexual to heterosexual, appear to have a point, since the APA's definition does seem to be this broad. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:44, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

Then there's the source from the American Psychiatric Association. It starts with the words, &quot;Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies).&quot; Again, note that as with the American Psychological Association source, this seems to limit Conversion therapy to techniques that are actually therapy, and does not correspond to the definition of Conversion therapy in the article, according to which any attempts at changing sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual are Conversion therapy, even if they aren't actually defined as therapies. So the article's definition seems simply to be wrong. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:56, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

Another passage relevant to the definition of Conversion therapy in that source. According to it, the American Psychiatric Association, &quot;...opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot; This seems to limit Conversion therapy to psychiatric treatments, which is once again a different definition from what appears in the article. Note also that it implies that something is only Conversion therapy if it takes the view that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or maintains as an assmpution that homosexual patients should change their sexual orientation, which would seem to conflict with much of what is in the article. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:59, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

Elsewhere in the American Psychiatric Association source, it mentions &quot;treatments that attempt to change a persons sexual orientation, also known as reparative or conversion therapy.&quot; Note that like the American Psychological Association source, this does not define conversion therapy as changing homosexuality to heterosexuality. What one finds in the sources of the article is actually a mixture of different possible definitions of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, and ''none'' of them are the same as what is in the article. Thus, the definition is going to have to be reworded completely, and I suspect large parts of the article are going to have to be cut out if the definition finally adopted makes any sense. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:05, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

Yet another source of the definition of Conversion therapy is from the article by Yoshino. It reads, &quot;In using the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; then, I do not mean the broader practice of conversion treatments, but the narrower practice of psychoanalytic techniques.&quot; Note that this doesn't match the definitions of Conversion therapy from the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, and doesn't correspond to what is in the article either. Actually, it shows that the term Conversion therapy is used in a variety of different and incompatible ways; the article is going to have to explain this, but it may be tricky to do that in a way that doesn't count as original research. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:14, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

:I have changed the lede section in accord with the above observations - but frankly, I think much of it still probably amounts to original research. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:44, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

:Note that since Yoshino adopts a definition of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; that effectively limits it to psychoanalysis, his article cannot be used to argue that conversion therapy in general is marginalized - only psychoanalytic attempts at changing sexual orientation. So here again, the article is going to have to be changed. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:53, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

:It would be as well to remember that neither of the APA sources, nor for that matter Yoshino's article, is primarily concerned with defining Conversion therapy, so these sources all have to be used with caution.

It won't do to just make up a definition of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; such that this article would be a place for all the different matters you refer to. Maybe a template would a good idea; I'm not sure. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:24, 31 August 2008 (UTC)

== Content of this article is broader than conversion therapy itself ==

As has been pointed out above, the contents of this article cover significantly more than conversion therapy.  The content is good, and should not be deleted.  We must figure out where the content goes.  Here are some suggestions:
# Malleability of sexual orientation should go to [[Homosexuality and psychology]].  Sexual orientation can change for lots of reasons besides conversion therapy.  The participants in Lisa Diamond's research did not even undergo conversion therapy.  Even the participants in Nicolosi's research who said they changed sexual orientation did not claim that it came through conversion therapy.  Some didn't even undergo conversion therapy and only went to ex-gay groups.  I think it is still essential to the topic, but maybe should be kept to a small section with a see also link to the main section on the homosexuality and psychology page.
# Non-conversion therapy techniques should go to [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]].  Again, I think [[ex-gay]] groups, [[Sexual Identity Therapy]], coaches, religious aspects and [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]] are related to the topic, but maybe we could put them in under a heading like &quot;Similar techniques&quot; so as to make clear that going to an ex-gay group is not considered conversion therapy.
Of course, these are suggestions, but I think this will help us better understand what exactly conversion therapy is. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:42, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

:I wouldn't be so quick to shift the Malleability of sexual orientation stuff. Much of it does seem to be about Conversion therapy. (Although I grant that everything in that section from, 'The American Psychiatric Association has stated...' to 'most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation..&quot;' is of debatable relevance).[[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 07:04, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

::I agree Malleability is related to conversion therapy, but my point is that it is also related to ex-gay groups, coaches, sexual identity therapy and in general homosexuality and psychology.  Since it is related to all of these other topics, I think it should go into a broader category.  Otherwise, when you are talking about the malleability of sexual orientation on the ex-gay page, you would have to link to conversion therapy, rather than a more neutral homosexuality and conversion therapy.  This page will still have a malleability section on it, just the main section will be on the homosexuality and psychology page.  Do you think moving the other topics to ego-dystonic sexual orientation is a good idea? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:40, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

::My impression is that there is no need why this section need be gutted at the moment. However, I may reconsider. It's only slowly become clear to me the kind of treatment this article needs, and my views could always change further. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:54, 4 September 2008 (UTC)

==No consistent distinction?==

The article reads, 'The ex-gay movement and the conversion therapy movement are closely linked and no consistent distinction is drawn between them in the literature.' I've already said this in an edit summary, but I'll say it again here: this statement absolutely must be removed if it is not sourced. I'm going to look through the sources of the article to see whether any of them can be used to support this; if I don't find something that can be used that way, out it goes. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 06:53, 4 September 2008 (UTC)

==Trying to add source==

I'm trying to add this a source (eg, &quot;answers&quot;, with ref name in front) to the first sentence in the article, to properly source it. However, every time I look at the results in preview, it messes up the article. Could someone with more editing skills please fix this? [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 08:37, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:If you add a reference such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;source&quot;&gt;http://www.source.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and want to use it later, then you'll need to write the next reference tag like this: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;source&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' (note the added 'slash' symbol).  What may be happening is that you are leaving out the ''''/'''' symbol the second time around - that would cause the rest of the page to be blanked.  Hope that helps.

:Thank you. I tried what you suggested, and it worked. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:59, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

==Removed sentence==

I removed the following sentence from the article, as it appears to be original research: &quot;The ex-gay movement and the conversion therapy movement are closely linked and no consistent distinction is drawn between them in the literature.&quot; The importance of removing this sentence is that it means that there are now ''no'' grounds for mentioning ex-gay groups in this article, except when the information ''directly'' relates to conversion therapy. That means more material needs to be removed from the article. If I've made a mistake about this, please provide the source for the sentence I've removed. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:02, 5 September 2008 (UTC)
:I think it is related, but the ex-gay groups themselves are not an example of conversion therapy.  Earlier I said:
::&quot;Non-conversion therapy techniques should go to ego-dystonic sexual orientation. Again, I think ex-gay groups, Sexual Identity Therapy, coaches, religious aspects and gay affirmative psychotherapy are related to the topic, but maybe we could put them in under a heading like &quot;Similar techniques&quot; so as to make clear that going to an ex-gay group is not considered conversion therapy.&quot;
:You said you saw no need for gutting that section.  Now you are the one suggesting gutting that section.  What's going on? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 18:17, 5 September 2008 (UTC)
::The section that I said didn't need to be gutted at the moment was Malleability of sexual orientation. What I removed was Ex-gay organizations, a different section. You have a point that there are plenty of topics that in one way or another are related to Conversion therapy but distinct from it - however, I think that only a minimal mention of these is what is needed here. In the past, this article has been bloated to monstrous proportions by the inclusion of huge amounts of material that is only marginally (or not at all) related to its main subject. Despite the large amounts of material I've cut out of the article, it's still at a size which (according to the article size guideline) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size] means that it should probably be divided into separate articles. Previously, it had been at a size according to which it, 'Almost certainly should be divided.' [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 21:25, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:If the article is to be divided, establishing a separate Reparative therapy article might be a good idea, although that would take some doing. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 21:56, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:::Since you removed the ex-gay section and the sexual identity therapy section, I am removing the malleability section.  Malleability has just as much to do with those other topics as conversion therapy does.  I'm also moving the deleted sections to other pages. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 22:32, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

:::I think the analogy you're using is flawed. The sexual identity therapy section was about a different subject, albeit one with some relevance to the subject of the article. The malleability of sexual orientation section is mainly about Conversion therapy. I have retitled it accordingly. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:00, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

::::The purpose of Sexual Identity Therapy is to &quot;help clients pursue lives they value.&quot;  If the lives they value is impossible, then Sexual Identity Therapy is giving them false hope.  Malleability of sexuality has a lot to do with Sexual Identity Therapy.  Same with ex-gay groups.  It also has a lot to do with psychology of homosexuality in general. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:30, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

::::However all this may be, I've undone your latest edit. I appreciate that the material in this article needs reworking - you were right to try to remove what's left of the section on gay affirmative psychotherapy and put that material somewhere else. However, I don't think that what you did was exactly the right approach. It doesn't really make sense to have a section called 'Related techniques' and to put Aversion therapy into it - Aversion therapy, as a treatment for homosexuality, isn't 'Related' to Conversion therapy, it is a kind of Conversion therapy. Gay affirmative psychotherapy isn't 'related' to Conversion therapy at all; it's diametrically opposed to it, and hence obviously not used in 'conjunction with' it. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 10:13, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
::::This page is set up to be pros versus cons.  That is not right.  The purpose of any therapy is to help clients pursue their own goals.  These other techniques are related in that they are designed to assist people who are uncomfortable with their own homosexuality.  Gay-affirmative therapy assists by helping people feel comfortable with their homosexuality.  Conversion therapy assists by helping people change their sexual orientation.  Gender-affirmative therapy assists by helping people reduce homosexual desires and behaviors.  Sexual Identity Therapy assists by helping people understand what direction they want to go and then follow that direction.  There is argument about how affective or how harmful these techniques are, but they reason each one of them was designed was to ultimately help the individual seeking treatment.  If you understand this page as an argument whether homosexuality should be changed or not, then you missed the boat.  Gay affirmative therapy is not opposite to conversion therapy.  Gay affirmative therapy seeks to help people who are unhappy with their homosexuality just as much as conversion therapy.  It just has a different approach.  I have changed the paragraph to make clear these different therapies do not have the same goals as conversion therapy and have removed aversion therapy as a separate therapy. However, Gender Wholeness Therapy and Context Specific Therapy aren't conversion therapies and should not be listed with them. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 20:06, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
::::This isn't an article about techniques that are designed to assit people who are uncomfortable with their own homosexuality. It's about Conversion therapy, and none of the various sources of the article define it that way. As for arguments about the rights and wrongs of Conversion therapy, believe me, I'll remove anything of that sort. I tracked down the article by A. Dean Byrd. It says of Gender-affirmative therapy: 'What is gender-affirmative therapy? It is simply the process of helping an individual change his or her sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual.' As such, it is, obviously, part of the subject of this article. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 07:26, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

==Gender Wholeness Therapy==

I removed all mention of Gender Wholeness Therapy from the article. The comments I made in the edit summary notwithstanding, I do appreciate that Gender Wholeness Therapy exists (I just discovered its website) - although the point about the article linked to not showing this stands. A mention of Gender Wholeness Therapy might be a good addition to the article - with a proper source. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:14, 7 September 2008 (UTC)
:Actually, I took another look at that website [http://www.genderwholeness.com], and it doesn't seem to use the expression 'Gender Wholeness Therapy', so I retract the comment about a mention of this therapy being a good addition.

==Nicolosi's views==

The article reads, 'Nicolosi has stated that if a father and son have a normal relationship, the son will not be gay.' There is a problem with this, which is that Nicolosi did not actually state this. What he apparently did was to answer 'yes' in response to the question, 'You're categorically saying that, if a father and son have a normal relationship, that child will not be gay?' Now I think the article has to be strictly accurate; it cannot imply that Nicolosi actually used the words, 'If a father and son have a normal relationship, the son will not be gay', if he did not use them. The only way of being accurate would be to state in the article that Nicolosi answered 'yes' in response to the question given. However, I do not consider this appropriate material for an article; what somebody says in an interview should not be given as much weight as what they say in a published book, particularly when the interview is a 'rush transcript.'

I am therefore going to remove this sentence from the article entirely. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 09:53, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

==Cutting back debate within professional literature==

I've recently cut back the section on debate within the professional literature, and I'm going to make further cuts. I think that this is an important enough change to require a detailed explanation. Now, before I started cutting it back, this section contained the following passage:

'In the United States, conversion therapy is currently allowed, under the American Psychological Association's code of conduct which states: &quot;Psychologists respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination.&quot; Gerald Koocher, president of the APA, stated: &quot;In a full multifaceted therapeutic relationship, the therapist has every duty to respond to patient choice and to help patients achieve their goals.... BUT... [First,] therapists must determine whether patients understand that their motives may arise purely from the social pressures of a homophobic environment.... [and second,] patients must understand that [treatments to modify sexual orientation] lack a validated scientific foundation and may prove psychologically harmful.&quot;[78]

Mark Yarhouse, of Pat Robertson's Regent University, wrote: &quot;[p]sychologists have an ethical responsibility to allow individuals to pursue treatment aimed at curbing experiences of same-sex attraction or modifying same-sex behaviors, not only because it affirms the client's rights to dignity, autonomy, and agency, as persons presumed capable of freely choosing among treatment modalities and behavior, but also because it demonstrates regard for diversity.&quot;[79] Yarhouse and Warren Throckmorton, of the private Christian school Grove City College, argue that the procedure should be available out of respect for a patient’s values system and because they find evidence that it can be effective.[80] Douglas Haldeman, who considers conversion therapy to be pseudoscientific,[81] similarly argues for a client's right to access to conversion therapy if requested from a fully informed position: &quot;For some, religious identity is so important that it is more realistic to consider changing sexual orientation than abandoning one's religion of origin...if there are those who seek to resolve the conflict between sexual orientation and spirituality with conversion therapy, they must not be discouraged.&quot;[54]

However, the code of conduct also states that &quot;Psychologists are aware that special safeguards may be necessary to protect the rights and welfare of persons or communities whose vulnerabilities impair autonomous decision making.&quot;'

There's certainly a lot of interesting and potentially very helpful information here, but unfortunately it is not arranged in a way that really makes sense. Everything in the paragraph that stretches from 'Mark Yarhouse' to 'must not be discouraged' is placed illogically; it interrupts the discussion of the APA's views. The part that starts, 'However, the code of conduct also states' should follow directly after 'may prove psychologically harmful', if this section is to make sense. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:44, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

:And come to think of it, the comments by Gerald Koocher shouldn't be where they are either, since they also interrupt the discussion of the APA code of conduct. Maybe they can go somewhere else in the article; I'm not necessarily opposed to their presence here, but their current location is no good. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 23:49, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

==History section not logical==

I've been removing material from the history section of the article, on the grounds that much of it is not in the right sections. It seems logical that material about conversion therapy outside the US should actually be in the section about conversion therapy outside the US. However, I've just noticed that almost all of the first section of the history section (Early sexologists) is about the history or prehistory of conversion therapy outside the US (Krafft-Ebing and Freud were not Americans). I don't think that all of this material can be placed in the outside the US section, but neither does it seem right to have things arranged the way they are now. I'm unsure what do to about this exactly, however, the entire history section probably needs major rewriting or reorganization. I would strongly encourage other editors interested in this topic to get involved in a discussion about this, because I am not sure exactly how to proceed here. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 00:45, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

:Just as an example of how the History section is not arranged properly: The section about the Early sexologists (which I retitled German and Austrian sexologists) ostensibly goes from 1886 to 1939. Yet it included a sentence that started, 'From this period through the middle of the 20th century, medical attempts to change homosexuality included surgical treatments such as...' The middle of the century is circa 1950, not 1939. Part of the problem here is the America-centric arrangement of things; it's very dismissive of the rest of the world for 'Conversion therapy outside the US' to be its own section (and also for the article not to start with the Germans).

== Clean-up and article overhaul ==

I suggest cleaning the talkpage to archive stale and resolved threads. From there start a new section stating the next phase of changes you think should happen and go from there. frankly, it's a subject that may be unpleasant or too sensitive for those who may be all too familiar with the rhetoric and practices. I remember some psychiatric survivor's awards that talked about the things that have been done in the past and it was painful to even read about it all.

== Quotations ==

This article contains too many quotations. I've recently removed a bunch of them, and I'll probably remove more. There's no need to have multiple quotations making the same points and expressing basically the same views - the right way to handle this is to simply summarize the main views. It isn't important that persons A, B, C, and D, all said X - just let readers know that X is a position several people have taken. Persons A, B, C, and D need not be mentioned unless there is a specific reason why this is necessary. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 05:26, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

Looking through the article, I think use of the acronym APA should be avoided due to the possibility of confusion between the two large organizations that go under that acronym. I'll go through the times its used and write out directly the organization thats being cited. [[User:SiberioS|SiberioS]] ([[User talk:SiberioS|talk]]) 23:58, 16 September 2008 (UTC)

== Effectiveness of conversion therapy ==

SCBC is trying to add this sentence, 'Some in the ex-gay/pro-conversion-therapy communities believe that sexual orientation can be completely changed,[99][100][101][102][103] while others indicate that complete change may not be realistic.[104' to the article. Anyone who looks at the sources provided will see that they are often about cases of change from homosexuality ''not achieved through conversion therapy''. They are thus irrelevant to the subject of this article, and it is appropriate to remove this passage. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 02:15, 20 September 2008 (UTC)

I understand your concern.  The modifications I have made should address the concern.

[[User:SCBC|SCBC]] ([[User talk:SCBC|talk]]) 14:09, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:Thank you for addressing this issue. However, although I'm not going to revert your edit immediately, I'm still not sure that this is a good use of sources. It is a possible case of [[WP:SYNTH]]. I tend to suspect this when several very different kinds of sources (a newspaper article is one thing, an publication in the Archives of Sexual Behavior something else entirely) are used to support one statement. Your edit sort of makes it look as though LIFE ministries and Robert L. Spitzer have the same position of changing sexual orientation; I don't think that's true at all. [[User:Skoojal|Skoojal]] ([[User talk:Skoojal|talk]]) 01:15, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

Skoojal:  I have again revised this sentence.  I think it is a stretch to say that the previous version of the sentence was a violation of [[WP:SYNTH]] in the first place, but I am attempting to remove any shred of doubt on the subject.  If you have further issues with my edit, I would request that you let me know and/or make changes that you think will enhance the edit, rather than simply reverting it over and over again.  Without this edit, this section of the article is misleading and POV, because it (absurdly) makes it appear that all pro-conversion-therapy voices agree that sexual orientation really can't be changed.  This is why I have inserted the edit and made several changes to edit in response to your feedback.  I believe that my most recent edit should completely address any good-faith concerns.

ALso the next sentance say's that the APA is looking into the study, but the actual article is more vague, stating that the APA wouldn't comment because it's doing it's own investigation. It doesn't say if it's investigating that specific study or just researching the same subject as that study.

== Ordering of sections ==

I moved the sections on conversion therapy in areas outside the US to a section at the end of the article called &quot;World trends&quot;.  As the &quot;World trends&quot; section states, conversion therapy outside the US largely tracks the trends occurring in the US.  It does not make sense to begin the article by leaping from country to country, decade to decade, describing what has occurred and is occurring throughout the world in regards to CT.  While we should get to that information at some point in the article, the article should not begin with that.  We should first describe where CT originated, and what it is.  

As much of CT centers in the US, it makes sense to focus on the psychoanalytical origins of CT, followed by the US history of CT (as this was the &quot;hotbed&quot; of such activity), followed by modern US trends (as this is where the majority of it centers), followed by world trends.  You may compare the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;oldid=248346521 version] which listed the world trends at the beginning of the article, with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;oldid=248423129 version] which lists the world trends at the end.  Thoughts?  [[User:Whatever404|Whatever404]] ([[User talk:Whatever404|talk]]) 16:11, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

:The reason you gave in the edit summary, &quot;political/social trends must not be placed before discussion of the history and definition of the practice(s)&quot;, is confused and mistaken. The &quot;World Trends&quot; section is about the history of conversion therapy in various countries; there is no difference between this and political/social trends. That conversion therapy outside the US tends to follow trends there is not by itself a reason for shifting the sections. That conversion therapy originated in the US is factually wrong. European psychoanalysts like Felix Boehm attempted it before Americans did (see, eg, Kenneth Lewes's The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality, p. 51). The 'psychoanalytic origins' of conversion therapy were in the work of Freud, who was not an American. Since you have given no satisfactory reason for your preferred arrangement of the sections, I am going to shift them again. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:60.234.28.135|60.234.28.135]] ([[User talk:60.234.28.135|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/60.234.28.135|contribs]]) 04:23, 30 October 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

::The version to which multiple editors have reverted does not propose that CT originated in the US.  It first relates the European psychoanalysts' writings, and then moves on to more modern CT attempts in the United States.  The majority of CT as we know it today centers in the United States.  It is entirely reasonable to focus first on CT's psychoanalytic origins, its centrality in the United States, and then, later on the trends in the rest of the world.  

::And, no, the ''World trends'' section does ''not'' focus on the &quot;history&quot; of CT worldwide, it provides virtually unrelated snippets of information from various decades.  The material is disjointed; it does not provide a clear description of CT. It is nonsensical to jump from continent to continent, decade to decade, before describing the topic of the article!  The version to which multiple editors have reverted first describes the history of CT, the majority of CT activity, which happens to center in the US, and then various trends elsewhere in the world. 

::At the moment, is that two established editors (myself and [[User:Pip2andahalf]]) have made edits to restore the version with ''World trends'' at the end.  If you wish to instate another version, I advise you to provide reasons that might convince your co-editors to agree to those edits.  At the moment, there is no consensus to have the material in the order you prefer.  I strongly encourage you to cease edit-warring, and to engaging in [[WP:CIVIL|civil]] discussion.  I have described, at length, the reasoning behind these edits.  You have provided minimal explanation for your own; and instead have focused on attacking the other version.  This conversation cannot move forward unless you describe the reasoning for your actions.

:::No, of course the version that you reverted back to didn't say that conversion therapy originated in the United States. It was you who apparently implied that when you wrote, &quot;We should first describe where CT originated, and what it is.&quot; Your statement that the article &quot;first relates the European psychoanalysts' writings&quot; is wrong. Krafft-Ebing was not a psychoanalyst. Freud is the only psychoanalyst mentioned in that section. Material about other early psychoanalysts is something that could usefully be added; Lewes is a good source.

== Political Debate ==

There is no reason for a separate 'political debate' section, and I have accordingly shifted its contents into US history, where they belong. The section was misleading because it starts, 'Conversion therapy has become highly politicized, and the ensuing debates &quot;have obscured the scientific data by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue.&quot;' That, and the rest of the information in that section, was misleading, because it makes it sound as though it were about political debate in all countries, whereas it in fact applies only to the US. I don't think there is any reason why my edit should be undone, but if someone absolutely insists on doing that, the section should be retitled. It is just as wrong to call it simply 'Political debate' as it would be to call 'Legal status in the US' simply 'Legal status.' It has to be perfectly clear what exactly it is about.

== Krafft-Ebing ==

I am considering deleting the brief mention of Krafft-Ebing in this article, although I am not yet sure this is the right thing to do. It contains information about Krafft-Ebing listing homosexuality in ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', and his views on what causes it. This is not information specifically about conversion therapy, although it can be argued that it provides added context. I think it should definitely stay if Krafft-Ebing's views influenced the development of conversion therapy, but I confess that I'm not sure about this. Sources are needed. Unless someone can add something about how Krafft-Ebing influenced conversion therapy, it is perhaps dubious to mention him here.

== Explain removal of material from article ==

I have removed the following text from this article, &quot;Individuals who feel conversion therapy has been helpful have protested the policies of the APA, stating that their views on issues such as the immutability of homosexuality have caused real harm to real people and patients.&quot; The source of this is an article from CNSNews.com, currently available [http://cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=6187 here]. The part of the article there that presumably is supposed to support this claim is the following observations by Randy Thomas, &quot;&quot;As a former homosexual, when I was involved in the 1980s promoting the gay agenda, our only focus was to seek tolerance,&quot; Thomas said, &quot;whereas today's political activism has moved from true tolerance into political domination and power. It's an amazing thing to watch a group that said they were oppressed become oppressors.&quot;&quot; Note that Thomas does ''not'' say that he changed from homosexuality through therapy, or that say that he thought conversion therapy helped him.

== Article is Unbalanced ==

This article contains a wealth of information on mainstream mental health organizations' perspectives on conversion therapy.  However, its coverage of pro-conversion-therapy perspectives is deficient.  In particular, there is a large section devoted to mainstream criticism of conversion therapy, with only a tiny subparagraph containing the responses of pro-conversion-therapy organizations and individuals and no mention of the substantial questions that have been raised about the basis for the mainstream organizations' stance.  Also, the section on effectiveness gives short shrift to pro-conversion therapy perspectives.  Much of the article reads like a defense of the mainstream perspective on conversion therapy, rather than an even-handed explanation of all sides of the issue.  I do not believe this is appropriate, especially given that the article is supposed to be about conversion therapy.  Perhaps there should be a separate article on mainstream mental health organizations' opposition to conversion therapy.

To be neutral, you would have to present the opposing viewpoints and then give arguments for and against each viewpoint, citing references to substantiate your statements. I would leave discussion of religion and morals out of the article since that gets away from the central issue of whether people can sometimes change their sexual orientation. I agree that the term 'reparative' is loaded/biased. Maybe 'change therapy' or 'change program' would be agreeable to all sides. Joseph Nicolosi and Richard Cohen, two prominent proponents of secular change programs, never propose to change happy homosexuals. Both authors emphasize that they aim to help change those with unwanted homosexual attractions. So, the single, narrow issue is: does change therapy work for some people, some of the time?  Ironically, Dr. Irving Bieber, one of the key advocates for the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality as a disorder from the psychiatric diagnostic and statistical manual, now believes that change is possible for some people, some of the time: approximately 25% become exclusively heterosexual, and some become bisexual. While many cannot change their sexual orientation, some apparently can. Note Bieber's article in Scientific Controversies: Case Studies in the Resolution and Closure of Disputes in Science and Technology, edited by H. Tristam Engelhardt Jr., and Arthur Caplan, Cambridge U. Press, 1987. Oxford and Cambridge are certainly at least on par with Harvard and Yale, if not superior.

:::Giving arguments for and against each viewpoint is exactly what we don't do on Wikipedia.  What we do do is give information from reliable sources.  In the case of something like this, pro-conversion organizations are considered fring groups by reliable mainstream science, which considers conversion therapy a pseudo-science.  According to [[WP:FRINGE]], &quot;Coverage on Wikipedia should not make a fringe theory appear more notable than it actually is. Since Wikipedia describes significant opinions in its articles, with representation in proportion to their prominence,it is important that Wikipedia itself does not become the validating source for non-significant subjects . . . Furthermore, one may not be able to write about a fringe theory in a neutral manner if there are no independent secondary sources of reasonable reliability and quality about it.&quot;  [[User:Exploding Boy|Exploding Boy]] ([[User talk:Exploding Boy|talk]]) 21:41, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

::::There are reliable sources that present both views, although the bulk of sources suggest that conversion therapy is harmful, and that claims about conversions are not backed up by hard evidence.  The relationship with religious motives for converting (both those who promote and those who wish to convert) is also documented.  Provided the religious aspect is sourced accurately and reliably, then it should not be an issue making the point.  The main thing is that the problems with using such a therapy for something that is not a mental health issue per se, but for the issues that can arise when trying to live in an environment where homosexuality is stigmatised - and/or where it is used for what is seen as a moral issue.

::::EB, I do not believe your reply is neutral. This time, I will number each point I am making, stating for each item whether it is fact or opinion. To demonstrate neutrality, you can reasonably do exactly the same. Does that seem fair and honest? Clearly, there is a difference between belief and knowledge, and there is a difference between opinion and fact. For knowledge to be sound, we must be scrupulously neutral about presenting all the relevant facts. (1) Fact: Dr. Irving Bieber was one of the most persuasive pro-gay voices in petitioning the APA in 1973 to remove homosexuality as a disorder from the psychiatric diagnostic and statistical manual.  (2) Fact: Today, that same pro-gay man, Irving Bieber, is still pro-gay and is not trying to push change on homosexuals who want to stay that way.  (3) Fact: Bieber conducted a study to explore whether some homosexual men really can change completely to heterosexual thought/fantasy/arousal patterns/orientation/however you want to put it.  (4) Fact: Bieber followed up, for 5 years, on all men who claimed complete change.  (5) Fact: Some men decided they were gay after all. Some vascillated between bisexuality and heterosexuality. But 25% of the originally homosexual men still claimed to have had exclusively heterosexual thoughts. This fascinated Bieber, and he questioned them every way he could think of until he was satisfied that these men indeed had successfully changed sexual orientation.  (6) Fact: Of course, simple math tells us that conversion therapy most often does not work, i.e., 3 out of 4 homosexual men who attempt reparative therapy will not make a significant change in sexual orientation  (7) Fact: In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association issued a statement stating, &quot;there are no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of reparative treatments.&quot; (7) Interpretation: the same man who passionately advocated for homosexuality no longer to be stigmatized as a psychiatric diagnosis code in 1973 is the same man who today states that to his surprise, he is thoroughly persuaded that homosexual men can change to complete heterosexuality approximately 25% of the time.  (8) Opinion: The APA is appropriately maintaining neutrality. On one hand, it observes that Bieber's interview-style study is not based on an objective set of criteria asked the same way every time for all participants in a truly random population sample, guaranteed to be free of self-selection bias. On the other hand, it does not dismiss the potential significance of this study, considering that it comes from the godfather of gay emancipation.  (9) Opinion: Years ago, people became wise to snake oil as a hoax, peddled by unscrupulous merchants as guaranteed to regrow hair. But it's fairly common knowledge that Rogaine and Propecia sometimes work for some men in doing just that. Of course, there are never any guarantees, but some people swear by these drugs.  (10) Opinion: When I was in middle school, Pluto was still a planet. But now science has decided that it is not. Several times in history, science has been mistaken at the top of its lungs.  (11) I think a fair statement to add to your article would be that reparative therapy is controversial and many in the mental health field even consider it potentially harmful but that more scientific corroboration is necessary to make a conclusion.

I'm confused by this sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1998, the American Psychiatric Association issued a statement opposing any treatment which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that a person should change their orientation, but did not have a formal position on other treatments that attempt to change a person's sexual orientation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don't know what this is supposed to mean - wouldn't a &quot;treatment ... based upon the assumption that ... a person should change their orientation&quot; automatically be an &quot;attempt to change a person's sexual orientation&quot;?

An editor reverted one of my edits; she stated that the word &quot;pathologizing&quot; for a psychoanalytic approach that held that homosexuality was an illness was not neutral.

You can maintain what you like, but your version is definitely NOT neutral. &quot;Pathologizing&quot; is a neutral and completely accurate term for a theory that defines homosexuality as an illness.

The editor I replied to has claimed several times that the word &quot;Pathologizing&quot; is POV, but has not given any reason.

The original wording was &quot;the above theory&quot;, which I thought was completely neutral and adequate.  As I think this over, I realize that &quot;pathologizing&quot; struck me as POV because I imagined it to be a phrase like &quot;degrading&quot;, which is clearly POV.

::One note, though, and I may be over-reacting here.

One of the sources being used to support the statement about Nicolosi's views being rejected by the psychoanalytic mainstream is Richard Isay's book Being Homosexual. This book does not even mention Nicolosi, which is not surprising, since it was published in 1989, before Nicolosi's first book was published. It plainly does not support the statement given in the article, which needs to be changed (and incidentally, although it does not use the word &quot;pathologizing&quot; it does identify Bieber and Socarides as people who viewed homosexuality as a pathology, and they are the people it criticises).

This subsection is located within a larger section on contemporary techniques of conversion therapy.

There are several issues.  First, this subsection is repetitive; it covers the same ground as some material from the history section.  Second, the last sentence is misleading; from my quick read-through of the cited study, the study does not indicate any current use of electroconvulsive therapy, but only mentions its use prior to 1980.  Therefore, this statement does not accurately reflect the cited source and is irrelevant to a section on contemporary techniques.  Third, I have not been able to access the Haldeman study, but I am dubious about the cited statement that &quot;masturbatory reconditioning&quot; is a method currently used by conversion therapy practitioners.  If anybody can find the study and check to see whether it really says this, that would be great.  I have done a bit of searching and have not seen any indication that any pro-conversion-therapy practitioner espouses this approach, so I cannot corroborate the statement from any other source. 

Thoughts?

I disagree about the source for the electroconvulsive therapy reference - it seems to be concerned with the use of this therapy since the 1950s and as far as I can see does not mention that it has not been used since 1980.

== Lead ==

I believe the mention of criticism of conversion therapy in the lead should remain focused on gay and lesbian groups specifically, since they have played the most important role in criticising conversion therapy (that was what I was trying to say in my edit summary, but I hit the save page key before I finished writing it). The sources of the article do not mention non-GLBT &quot;human rights&quot; groups that have criticised conversion therapy. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 03:25, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

== [[Aesthetic Realism]] ==

[[Aesthetic Realism]] should be included in the history section. The New York City-based group promoted itself as a provider of conversion therapy in the 1970s and 1980s. (Perhaps ironically, it believed men could be cured of homosexuality by studying poetry.) It achieved nationwide attention when some converted members were interviewed on national TV. The group put out a book and took out advertisements in major newspapers across the country. They became targets of gay rights groups in the 1980s and, in 1990, stopped making public claims about homosexuality (thogh they still promote the therapy for curing other disorders). Nowadays it's mostly forgotten, but I think it may deserve a sentence in the history section. See [[Aesthetic Realism#Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality]] for an overview. &amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;[[User:Will Beback|&lt;font color=&quot;#595454&quot;&gt;Will Beback&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp; [[User talk:Will Beback|&lt;font color=&quot;#C0C0C0&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt; 06:43, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

While interesting and noteworthy, this is just a small detail so I don't want to give it excess weight. Even a full sentence may be too much. I was just checking sources and notice one book in Google's snippet view that lists it as a &quot;quack therapy&quot; along with Reichian [[vegetotherapy]] (which is probably accurate, though other sources give it a little move prominence). Aesthetic Realism's conversion therapy was mostly in the '70s and '80s, so I'm thinking that this could go just after the Primal Scream material.

== Bergler section ==

You asked for comments, so my initial comment is on Bergler, giving his views prior to 1938 without detailing his practices in the 1950's seems a bit odd.  I will supplement this when I have time.  Also, does Bergler talk about 'conversion therapy' in 1988 per se, or has somebody made some connection between his approach and conversion therapy?  I do not have access to the source - but unless Bergler can be demondtrated as having described his approach as 'conversion therapy', then it should not be claimed that he was talking about this.  My reading of his work is that he was talking about something more akin to aversion atherapy.  Many of the points you make in the lead are about aversion therapy, not conversion therapy which antedates aversion therapy - it is important not to confuse the two.  Aversion therapy was about stopping people acting upon their sexual feelings.  If you are saying that conversion therapy is the same as aversion therapy, then this should be called aversion therapy instead. Pretending that what was aversion therapy is the same as what is conversion therapy is problematic. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 07:34, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

Most of the historical section is inaccurate.  You can put this as historical background on the development of understanding about homosexuality and approaches to treating it as a disorder, but it is specious to describe the historical approaches as conversion therapy.  What developed out of these approaches was aversion therapy.  Conversion therapy is a relataively recent approach from the USA, and is tied-in with the idea that homosexual is sinful and for this reason people will seek re-orientation or conversion to avoid the stigma and ostracism associated with it.  This is very different from earlier approaches, and they are not about conversion therapy.  To describe them this way breaches NPOV, because it seeks to give a contested practice an appearance of authority that it doesn't have. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:05, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

::I realize that the information about Bergler's views on the causes of homosexuality is rather detailed and may not necessarily seem appropriate to the article. However, Bergler's claims in the 1950s about how homosexuality should be (as it were) cured depended crucially on his earlier theories about the oral basis of homosexuality. So although this information isn't directly about conversion therapy, in my judgment it is necessary to include it here. It may not be an ideal approach, but at the moment I can't see a better way of handling this. You're entirely right that there should be more about Bergler in the American history section, but it's perfectly easy to add that information. Bergler did not, to my knowledge, ever describe his approach as &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, but I don't see that as being in the slightest way relevant, since what he did does fall under the definitions that the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association have provided. The same thing is true of the other writers mentioned. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 08:18, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

:::I am glad you agree it is not about conversion therapy, so why call it conversion therapy?  I have no issue about this (and aversion therapy generally) being included as part of the background to an article about conversion therapy.  What I do take issue with is describing earlier theorists and practitioners as if what they were doing was conversion therapy when neither the term nor concept had been developed.  So, what I would suggest you do is re-work the historical section as a background section, change where people who (or approaches that) pre-date conversion therapy are described as having something to do with conversion therapy, and then pick out where ideas where later picked up in the construction of conversion therapy using appropriate sources.  Otherwise, the bulk of the historical section becomes a synthesis - because it is arguing that what some people were doing was conversion therapy before conversion therapy had been constructed, and yet that cannot be demonstrated from the sources, only by interpreting the sources this way.  It is a revision of the history, on the basis of developments that came later, to make that history appear to conform to the developments that came out of that history as if there was a consistency between the later development and the earlier ideas and practices.  That is an argument one might make, but it would be original research.  Either way, it is not encyclopedic.  The NPOV is not to make claims about the pedigree of conversion therapy, but to document the history accurately, and show how conversion therapy was developed and how some pointed to historical examples to support their work in this area.

:::That is not what I said the problem about Bergler was.  What I said was that Bergler's approach in the 1950's is not dealt with, and this is significant.  Bergler's approach was that the best way to treat homosexuals was to abuse them as much as possible - bullying, victimisation, lying and breaking confidentiality were all seen as appropriate ways of dealing with homosexuals, because they were masochistic and only through extreme victimisation was there any possibility of their becoming aware of the masochism that drove them.  He argued that the liberal approach which tried to help and support homosexuals was wrong, because this did not help them understand their situation in the way that an intolerant approach would.

:::If you like I can go through and add stuff about Bergler, and edit the history section in a way that it doesn't make claims about people doing conversion therapy before the term had been coined - although I do not really have time for that.  I would far rather you understand what I am getting at, and go through it and correct it accordingly. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:58, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

::::It's simply not relevant that the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; wasn't used by Freud or Bergler or any of the others. Per the definitions given by the relevant organizations, attempts to change sexual orientation through psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment are conversion therapy regardless of whether the people doing them describe them that way or not. I don't agree that this is synthesis or original research. The American Psychiatric Association's position statement on conversion/reparative therapy (http://archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200001.pdf) indicates pretty clearly that it considers these older approaches to be conversion therapy. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 09:20, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

:::::It is relevant when you lay claims to them using 'conversion therapy'.  As the APA say here: &quot;In recent years, noted practitioners of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality&quot;.  In describing what they refer to as &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapy the APA are making clear they are describing a new phenomenon which draws on earlier approaches.  If you are not happy about rectifying this innacuracy, I can address this in the text itself quite easily. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:38, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
::::::What you are saying is simply wrong. Conversion therapy is a general term for psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment intended to change homosexuality. It does not apply only or mainly to religious approaches, as you incorrectly stated. One misleading quote (&quot;In recent years, noted practitioners of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality (16,17,18).&quot;) doesn't prove your point. It's clear that it applies only to one particular subset of therapists, not to all of them. The sentence before the one you quoted reads, 'The theories of &quot;reparative&quot; therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both (10-15).' Take a look at sources 10-15. They include Freud among other people, so there is no need for additional sources to show that Freud was talking about conversion therapy. The APA indicates clearly that it considers older approaches conversion therapy. Regarding Bergler specifically, he is mentioned in Kenneth Lewes's book, which the APA mentions as a criticism of conversion therapy.[[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:32, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
::::::One of the additions you made, &quot;Since 1990 attempts to change sexual orientation originating in a Christian context have become known as conversion, reorientation, or reparative therapy. These reflect understandings that sexual identity can be 'converted' from what is seen as an abnormal, sinful or diseased homosexuality to heterosexuality, sexual attraction and/or practice 'reoriented' from the same sex to the opposite sex, or damaged sexual attractions 'repaired' through therapy.&quot;, does not appear to be properly sourced. I see it as quite misleading and unhelpful, as well as original research. There's no indication in any reliable source that conversion therapy specifically refers to therapy in a Christian context; actually, sources show the reverse of this, eg, that it's simply a general term for attempts to change homosexuality through therapy, whether Christian or not.

That quote is from the APA article you cited - if I am wrong, then so is the APA - or you have misinterpreted them.  Have you read the Spitzer study and peer commentaries?

The whole way these sections are broken down is scrappy - it needs reorganizing.  You go through Austria and Germany historically, but not in a clearly marked history section, then have Lacan in the history section even though the citation of his approach is from 1997, have a section on recent developments, from the 1980's, and have items from the 1950s and very recent from the UK.  Apart from the fact that the Freuds, Bergler etc. did much of their work after the 1930's in the USA you have kept them in the Austria section, you have Hirschfeld in there (who was not interested in stopping homosexuality because he was queer himself), and you are citing people as doing conversion therapy when they weren't, they were experimenting on gay people to try and find ways of curing them of homosexuality - as you rightly say using aversion therapy, hormones, castration, lobotomy, etc.  That has nothing to do with conversion therapy, which is a relatively recent concept.  I have no problem with you showing the influences that gave rise to conversion therapy, but I do take issue with you saying that what somebody like Bergler did is conversion therapy.  You asked people to have a look at this article and make comments - at least you could have the courtesy when they take the effort to do so to listen to what they are saying instead of saying it doesn't matter if you say things that weren't conversion therapy were - in an encyclopedia it does matter.  Conversion therapy is the way Christians have managed to justify continuing to treat something that is no longer regarded as a mental illness as if it is a mental illness - when it was regarded as a mental illness it was not called conversion therapy, it was called treating homosexuals. 

I was trying to tidy up your sections when you reversed my edit - which makes me a bit pissed really, because I don't have that much time to go back and start all over again.  I'm reluctant to go back and waste my time doing it again, and am tempted just to leave this as a rambling article about all the people who treated homosexuals over the past 100 years, which in your mind seems to have something to do with conversion therapy, but the only way you seem to justify that is by saying that some of them did conversion therapy - when they didn't.  They lobotomised, castrated and other abusive things to gay, lesbian and trans people. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:34, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

:I suggest that you have misinterpreted the APA, not me. You haven't really responded on that point. Austria and Germany are in sections by themselves because lumping all the history of conversion therapy (of which there is a great deal) into one big section would be an awkward approach. I'm open to reasonable suggestions about how the organization of the article might be changed. The citation of Lacan being from 1997 is irrelevant, since it concerns his views and practice before that time (by which point he was dead). Regarding Hirschfeld, the historical fact of the matter is that he did indeed refer gay people who wanted to go straight to conversion therapists. We might wish it were otherwise, but that is the truth, and the article should not conceal the fact. You offer no sources to support your claim about ''conversion therapy'' being specifically a Christian term, which it plainly isn't.

::I suggest you stop wasting people's time by asking for help you are not willing to accept.

* The theories of &quot;reparative&quot; therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both (10-15). In recent years, noted practitioners of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality (16,17,18).
* The earliest scientific criticisms of the early theories and religious beliefs informing &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapies came primarily from sexology researchers (19-27). Later, criticisms emerged from psychoanalytic sources as well (28-39). There has also been an increasing body of religious thought arguing against traditional, biblical interpretations that condemn homosexuality and which underlie religious types of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy (40-46).

::What this suggests to me is that what the APA are talking about is a new synthesis of old ideas in a religious context.  But you believe what you want.  And you organize it how you want.

Don't mistake my now telling you things straight with incivility.  The history stuff needs to be that, a history section, and condensed. It is too long before you get to the meat of the article, and focuses on stuff that influenced what has become called conversion therapy before dealing with the actual article topic.  The way it is written implies that what is being discussed with conversion therapy is the same thing as what was happening up to the 1950's.  It is important that you draw a distinction for specific reasons.  What is now referred to as 'conversion therapy' is a religious response to the liberalisation in law and medicine towards homosexual practice.  It draws on a body of work that developed that was shown to be ineffective and rejected, and it re-introduces things that are known to have not worked and actually harmed people.  What came before has been reframed, in a way that makes it appear new.  In other words, what went before influenced what the article is about, but that was not regarded as 'conversion therapy', it was about treating, curing, or averting homosexual practice.  That is all, it is not such a big deal.  If it was 'conversion therapy' in the way you claim, you should be able to find citations that show this - but you won't find them, because Bergler etc. never used the term - it is recent.  If you are stating that recent sources argue that people like Bergler were doing conversion therapy, then you need to cite who says Bergler was doing conversion therapy.  If you are claiming that chemical and physical castration, lobotomy, electric shock treatment, aversion therapy, etc. were forms of conversion therapy, then you need to state that clearly, citing whoever has made that claim. If you are saying that the APA argue that earlier approaches were 'conversion therapy', then you need to cite where the APA state this explicitly.  Now, you can ignore this if you like, but I'd suggest to you that if you do ask for help, then dismiss what those who have offered to help say, you are setting yourself up for a whole heap of trouble, because it is not the best way to go about things.

==World Trends==

I have deleted the world trends section, moving some of the information in it to other parts of the article and removing the rest entirely. My reason for doing this is that there appear to be only five countries (Austria, Germany, France, the United Kindgom, and the United States) that have played an important role in the development of conversion therapy. Covering conversion therapy in all countries in the world is not possible here, and it would make the article much too long if this was attempted. Much of the material I have deleted is valuable and does belong somewhere on Wikipedia, but after some consideration I've decided that this is not the place for it. The biography of Robert Spitzer, LGBT Rights in South Africa, Homosexuality in China, Homosexuality in India, LGBT Rights in Denmark, LGBT Rights in Norway, LGBT Rights in Finland, and LGBT Rights in New Zealand are the articles that this material should be shifted to (it's an easy task to retrieve it from older versions of the article).

== Added POV tag to history section ==

There are a couple of POV problems in this article - one is questioning the religious and social conservative influence in 'conversion therapy' as being significant in how it is defined, despite references in the APA, Zucker, Drescher, Spizer, et al.  The second is that despite there being no references to 'conversion therapy' for writers before 1990 by the APA, Zucker, Drescher, Spizer, et al., any attempt to highlight this has been met with reverts of fact tags and denial in discussion.  For this reason, the neutrality is question of the history section in particular, but also other aspects of the article where the significance of religious (and social conservative) motivations in 'conversion therapy' is downplayed.  Reading Zucker, Drescher, Spizer et al, this is of significance to this type of therapy, because from this it can be understood that 'conversion therapy' is a psychological treatment for something that is not a psychological illness, but a moral one. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 10:39, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

:Neither APA defines conversion therapy as such as being either religious or politically conservative. The other sources you mention also do not do this. Your claim that there are no references to conversion therapy for writers earlier than 1990 is factually wrong. The American Psychiatric Association position statement indicates that the term does apply to early efforts at changing sexuality orientation. I've pointed this out repeatedly, and you have just as repeatedly dodged the issue. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:06, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

::Erm - they only discuss it in that context.  I have yet to find a source that does not discuss conversion therapy in connection with religious and social conservatism.  No, the APA pragaraph with the one reference to Freud links to a source that does not detail anything like conversion therapy, only Freud's theoretical framework, which as it says in the APA text informs 'reparative therapy' - I have not found any reference to Bergler or Krafft-Ebing in the context of conversion therapy in the APA or any other source.  I have pointed out repeatedly that you are misreading this as referring to earlier sources, particularly Krafft-Ebing (who is not even mentioned); in the process I have gone back to those who inform the APA - specifically Zucker, Drescher and Spitzer, in the Spitzer study and peer reviews and other writings, which include the connection to religious and social conservatism, and do not detail early sources as 'conversion therapy'.  What does appear to be the situation is that the origin of what we now understand as reparative/conversion therapy is about 1980, and some sources refer to some treatments from the 1960's as conforming to what becomes reparative or conversion therapy.  (most tend to refer to 'reparative therapy' - many arguing this is the same as 'conversion therapy', with some argue reparative therapy is a specific approach only applicable to people like Nicolosi - and others suggest that 'sexual orientation reorientation therapy' is a general description for therapies seeking to effect change in homosexuals, with 'conversion' and 'reparative' therapies being specific to certain types of treatment in a religious and/or socially conservative context.

In ''Sexual conversion therapy: ethical, clinical, and research perspectives'', Ariel Shidlo &amp; Jack Drescher, Haworth Press (2002), Jack Drescher in the paper ''I'm Your Handyman: A History of Reparative Therapies,'' says:

&quot;Although psychoanalysts have proffered and claimed homosexual conversion since the time of Freud, a recently coined term, ''reparative therapy'' (Nicolosi, 1991), has come to generically define talking cures that claim to change an individual's homosexual orientation to a heterosexual one.  Although other treatment modalities such as aversion therapies and psycho-surgery have also promied to 'cure' homosexuality, the history of reparative therapies has become inexorably linked with that of psychoanalysis.&quot;  Then goes on to discuss the history of the theories of psycho-analytic practitioners from Freud and the relationship to homosexuality, as well as describing the evolution of reparative therapists from medically concerned practitioners to antigay political activists.

So, note that he is clear that reparative therapy is newly coined, and there is a demarcation between earlier psycho-analytic practice stemming from Freud, and later reparative therapy - and he is specific in distinguishing aversion therapies and psycho-surgery as 'other' than therapies aiming to convert homosexual orientation to heterosexuality, such as ''reparative therapy''.  This contradicts what is said in the lede - where these are listed as this type of treatment.  The difference is significant, because the older therapies inhibited, suppressed or eliminated homosexual behaviour and/or attraction, rather than claimimg conversion to heterosexual attraction and desire. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:26, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

:The definition given by the American Psychological Association is clear, and it doesn't involve religion. Vaguely alleging that the 'context' shows that they think it is inherently religious is silly and unsubstantiated. You write that, 'the APA pragaraph with the one reference to Freud links to a source that does not detail anything like conversion therapy.' That's true, and totally irrelevant, since the APA clearly indicates that Freud was practicing conversion/reparative therapy. Krafft-Ebing's work meets the definition they give, and their not referring to him directly makes no difference. Note that they mention Kenneth Lewes's book ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality'' as a criticism of conversion therapy; Bergler is one of the people Lewes crticises. So it's clear the term does apply to Bergler. Everything else you say is irrelevant, as it's only your mistaken personal opinion. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:42, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

:Drescher's choosing to define the term reparative therapy that way doesn't alter the fact that other sources (the American Psychiatric Association) do not define it that way. It's not crucial, but your comment that &quot;the older therapies inhibited, suppressed or eliminated homosexual behaviour and/or attraction, rather than claimimg conversion to heterosexual attraction&quot; is wrong. Isidore Sadger claimed to do exactly what you say the older therapies did not attempt. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:43, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

::I have to plead ignorance about Sadger, so you can say what you like about him - I know a bit about Westphal, Krafft-Ebing, Ellis, Freud, Hirschfeld and Bergler - Bergler's approach was not at all nice, in fact, it was deliberately sadistic, because he argued that only by mistreating homosexuals could they ever have any hope of escaping their condition.  I have read a copy of Bergler's book from the 1950's, and I thought I had it somewhere, but can't find it (maybe I borrowed it from the British Library).  I really appreciate the changes you have made, it makes me feel much happier.  There was a similar problem on the [[homosexual transsexual]] where somebody had out that Hirschfeld coined the term - when he clearly hadn't.  I get a bit obsessive about things like that.  It does read much better now.  Thanks.  I'll leave the others up to you - because I agree that the APA have made a very ambiguous reference to Freud.  Personally, I wouldn't refer to anything before 1980 this way, although I could now accept that as far back as 1960 people were attempting this sort of thing.  As for Bergler?  My own view is he hated homosexuals intensely, and treated them the way he did in the hope that they would commit suicide, which I expect many did; I also suspect he had no interest in curing them, but he enjoyed being sadistic to them and used his professional position to develop a method for doing so - that would be a POV, though.

:::I rewrote the sections on Krafft-Ebing and Freud to avoid leaving readers with the impression that they used the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; partly in response to your comments. I don't think it makes such a crucial difference, but it is probably slightly better to avoid using the term where they're concerned. I believe that answers your argument that the History section is not in accord with NPOV. The tag should be removed. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:44, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
::::That's great, I've removed the tag.  You might like to think about how the history section could be condensed (and the lede, as Benji suggests; some of the earlier versions of the lede worked quite well, and material that is moved out could be part of an introductory section before or after terminology).  Where Bergler is concerned, I think it is important to put his work after 1938 in the USA section, as he worked there for nearly 25 years, was featured in the media on this issue, and wrote books for lay readers, telling people that homosexuality could be changed.  Looking at the last paragraph, perhaps that should be located with something on his work in the USA as well.  I am happy to expand on his work in the USA, as he was important in conveying a certain sterotype of gay men there, as well as the idea that it was possible to cure people by bullying them out of homosexuality.

:::::I'm quite open to suggestions about the lead. It could probably be improved in a number of ways, but I haven't seen any definite proposals so far. It would be misleading to place material about what Bergler wrote in the 1930s, before moving to the States, anywhere except in the Austria section. Post-1938 stuff does belong in the American section, however, so the final sentence of the Austrian section on Bergler might be removed or be relocated.

== History of this article ==

I was taken aback when I reviewed the history of this article - two years ago it was at Good Article status, it was positively peer reviewed, and although it failed to make it as a Featured Artcle, got some positive feedback.  By the end of 2008 it was still looking OK, having lost some of the USA-centric weighting, but much of the structure and content was still there.  Then it began to envelop a massive history section which detailed the work of just about any psychotherapist or psychoanalyst in Austria, Germany &amp; the USA who has ever treated a homosexual - Lacan is in there because he didn't do conversion therapy! Even the UK's Melanie Klein is in there now!  Who next I wonder - Fromm, Karen Horney?  I'm sure they must have treated a homosexual or two at one time or another.  Eric Berne said something about homosexuality in one of his books I read 25 years ago, I'm sure - shall I look it up and see if we can squeeze that in somewhere too?

It has developed into an article about therapists and analysts who have treated homosexuals, sandwiched between a lede that is too long and a reduced discussion of conversion therapy at the end that from reading you would never know is promoted by religious groups as a gay-cure.  It used to say something about this - and yet despite 30% of the coverage in some papers being on religion and coversion therapy, it hardley features in this article any more, even the APA statement talks about this - yet it seems this article has completely lost the plot.  It is about conversion therapy.

The fact that it cannot make Good Article status any more should suggest something.  That it was better before!  And by comparing what was good about this article in 2007 (e.g. the lede), what was covered and what wasn't (the history of psychoanalysis and homosexuality), and reviewing the changes since 2007 to see what could have improved and what diminished it, then this would help to restore this article back to its former status.

This needs to be sorted out, or else the way it is going it will eventually get to a point where somebody puts it forward for deletion because the content no longer relates to the title.  Why not take the bulk of the history section out, move it to 'history of people who have treatmed homosexuals' or something, and restore the earlier relevant background section, along with the earlier reduced lede, and the international sections - all as they relate to current practice, including the USA? [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:36, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I knew I'd read it in Berne - 1969 - &quot;If a homosexual wants to be 'cured', it is possible with enough treatment&quot; p.253 in the 1981 UK Penguin edition of ''A Layman's Guide Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'', p.253.  Better squeeze him in too... [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 10:07, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

: I don't see what your problem is with the mention of Lacan. It actually relates more closely to conversion therapy than does some of the other information in the article (eg, the mention of the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder - the discussion of that here doesn't even mention conversion therapy at all). I added it not so much because of what it shows about Lacan, but because of what it shows about gay people in France - that they preferred to avoid therapists who tried to change homosexuality. I've no wish to add anything about Fromm, who never played any important role in the development of conversion therapy that I'm aware of. Mentioning Eric Berne would probably be a case of WP:Undue.

: You may perhaps be right that the lead is too long; I'm open to suggestions about how it might be shortened (it was much too short in earlier versions of the article). What you say about it is incorrect; it does indeed mention ex-gay groups and their promotion of conversion therapy. It is quite wrong to suppose that because the article was deemed a Good Article once, but isn't now, that it was therefore actually better in the past. The lead as it was on March 12, 2007 was awful and seriously misleading - it simply identified conversion therapy with the ex-gay movement, even though there is no agreement among sources that they are the same thing. The criteria for Good Articles have changed since this article was last deemed Good. See Malleus Fatuorum's comments about that on his user talk page; the article has never met the current Good Article criteria. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 02:06, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I was being sarcastic about Fromm &amp; Berne etc., the point is that whole History section represents WP:Undue, especially as the reasoning that places most of the content in there is based on an indirect quote about Freud - and yet direct contemporary quotes from sources discussing conversion therapy and its religious connections are excluded. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 07:08, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

::: You may have been being sarcastic, but I gave you a serious answer - I don't see any point to mentioning Fromm or Berne here. The reasoning you refer to is about, I suppose, the American Psychiatric Association's position statement. It indicates clearly that Freud and other early figures were involved in conversion therapy and can be mentioned here. If you have anything you want to add about conversion therapy's connections with religion, then add it by all means, if it is compatible with policies on neutrality, verification, and due weight. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:15, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

::::Perhaps the easiest way to deal with this would be a subsection under [[Conversion therapy#Contemporary theories and techniques]] expanded to include 'issues' which pulls together the references here about the religious connections, and expands with comments from recent papers about that, to show how this came about, and show how that situation developed, and the relationship with medical approaches.  It could go there, or under [[Conversion therapy#Medical, scientific and legal views in the U.S.]] - although while this issue does seem to be more of an issue in the US, it has implications outside the US.  Or it could simply be a small section for that purpose.  It's important to balance the two aspects - that people with a religious perspective took an existing frame, and developed it in a particular way, which then became used by some therapists and promoted by some religious groups - and clearly illustrate the the way this developed; when the details are scattered amidst a wealth of detail, it is not apparent, and this aspect appears to be almost insignificant.  It clearly isn't, because of the attention it has received by the likes of Dreschet, Spizer et al., and the APA, as well as the press.

==Trends in Psychoanalysis==

I removed a paragraph about trends within psychoanalysis from the American history section. Like I said in the edit summary, the information is helpful, but it isn't specifically about developments in America, and it was misleading of me to have placed it there. When I put it there, I thought that it should go somewhere in the article, but I'm no longer sure that there is any good place for it here. Mish has relocated the information at the start of the History section. I can understand the reason for this, but I honestly don't think that it was the right move.

The information is lacking a heading, and it's just not clear why the History section should start with an untitled section about developments within psychoanalysis in the early 20th century (this places it before Krafft-Ebing and the late 19th century stuff; logically, it should come after them if it were to go here at all). If there's no good, logical place for the information, that's a sign it doesn't belong in the article. I think this information might be better for the Homosexuality and psychology article, which is languishing and doesn't have much content. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 08:12, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

:Well, the most obvious point there is that this is about psychoanalysis, not psychology.  If this should go in that article, then why not the rest of the section that covers psychoanalysis (if that article is lacking, it could be a good solution - although the pedant in me would argue it should be re-named psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis and homosexuality) and leave this portion of summary here?  It was inserted there as part of an introduction to a rather long history section, which could be supplemented by some of the material that doesn't need to be in the lede.  I have no objection to moving it up into an explicit 'introduction' section - I think it would be useful as part of an overview for people who are interested in the background to conversion therapy, but who do not want to read an exhaustive history of such approaches. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 10:13, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

::I've added a sub-section title for that.  I've consolidated one contributor under Hungary, as he was Hungarian.  It was dodgy time, and now these countries have achieved full independence from a variety of imperial arrangements that went on for over a century, it seems fitting to treat them as the separate entities they now are, and once were before. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 10:28, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

:::I don't think it makes sense to say that psychoanalysis isn't a school of psychology. Freud said himself at one stage that psychoanalysis was a form of psychology, among other things. In any event, psychoanalysis is clearly relevant to psychological about homosexuality, so it shouldn't make that much difference whether it counts as a form of psychology or not. Giving the Homosexuality and psychology article such a long title doesn't seem like a good idea. You are right that most of the material about psychoanalysis and homosexuality here would belong just as well in Homosexuality and psychology, but it would not be a good idea to remove it from this article. Some overlap between the articles is inevitable, and not necessarily harmful. I still think that the trends in psychoanalysis material should probably be removed from the article altogether, and worked into Homosexuality and psychology. It would difficult to keep it within this article in a way that makes sense; it certainly doesn't work as an introduction to the History section as a whole. As for separating Hungary into a different section, that is ahistorical; Hungary wasn't independent when Ferenczi wrote the stuff that the section on him covers. I also don't think it's appropriate to have a whole section on &quot;Hungary&quot; that actually consists of material on just one writer. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:41, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

* I think you would be better moving the whole lot there, with a link in the article to that article - it is too voluminous for this article anyway, and that way it could be justifiably maintained without losing what I do agree is very good material.  Then the precis here would serve to inform the discussion about the contemporary issues, with a link to more detailed information.  Maybe you are right about that, but from what I know about the three disciplines they are different.  Perhaps 'Homosexuality and psychological approaches', or 'Psychological approaches to homosexuality'?
* Putting a Hungarian in [[Austria]] is just odd.  It was the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], not Austria, which consisted primarily of Austria and [[Hungary]] as dual monarchies with separate legislatures etc., and it lasted until 1918 - he was publishing up until 1933, and most of the work covered in citations post-dates 1918, so a significant part of his work was in Hungary per se.  If you look at [[Sándor Ferenczi]], it says Hungary.  Hungary remained a nation state regardless of the joint sovereignty arrangement with Austria.  To do this you would need to rename that section Austria-Hungary, which would be even odder, because of the work cited that happened after 1918.  I don't see how having only one item under Hungary is an issue - try finding another one.
* On the UK side, you might like to look into [[Hans Eysenck]] - he was carrying out aversion therapy at the Maudsley Hospital into the 1970's.  The UK [[Gay Liberation Front]] disrupted one of his lectures in protest, and through that and other actions the Maudsley reviewed its practice and stopped doing it.  [[Peter Tatchell]] discusses this briefly on his site [http://www.petertatchell.net/psychiatry/dentist.htm], but there are other sources.  Something else I can do when I have more time if you don't want to. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:11, 8 June 2009 (UTC)



* I think we have to face the fact that there's inevitably going to be a lot of overlap between Homosexuality and psychology and Conversion therapy, if both of these articles are developed to a satisfactory condition. They will have a different focus and approach, but still will have to cover much of the same ground. Maybe the material about psychoanalysis in Conversion therapy could be abbreviated somewhat if Homosexuality and psychology were improved, but I'm not yet convinced that it should be, and we're not at that point yet. 

* Austria and Austria-Hungary can be covered together for the purposes of this article, which is about conversion therapy rather than Austrian or Hungarian history. It's a pragmatic consideration more than anything else. There was a note in the Austria section that Ferenczi was writing when Hungary was part of Austria-Hungary, but you removed it. I can't see that that was a good idea. The material on Ferenczi is about papers written in 1909, 1912, and 1914. It strikes me as unfortunate to include some material about conversion therapy in Hungary (if any can be found) simply because there was one important early figure there, when that material otherwise wouldn't be relevant or important enough to include.

* Regarding the UK, yes, Eysenck is certainly one of the figures who should be mentioned. I don't have much material about him. Other things that should be covered are the work of Havelock Ellis, and the recommendations about treatment of homosexuality in the Wolfenden Report. I hope to summarise the latter at some point in the near future. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:33, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

** You were the one who said that having him in Hungary was wrong historically - when actually it is wrong to have him in Austria.  Hungary was Hungary and Austria was Austria, even under the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Hungary never was Austria.  But as I suggested, Asutro-Hungary is a problem as some of the papers were written after then (not so many once I moved Anna Freud to the UK, and Bergler to the USA, however).  OK then, to avoid the implicit inaccuracy of locating a Hungarian in Austria, I will call it Austria AND Hungary.  OK?
** Bergler's homosexuality paper was published in English in the USA in 1938 - the year he left Austria and moved to the USA - unlike his earlier paper which was in German and published where he used to live.  So, if you don't want these split up, it would be better to put them both in the USA, as his cited work on homosexuality was published there.

::Calling the section Austria and Hungary doesn't seem very elegant to me, but I am content to leave it with that title for the moment, since I am tired of this silly issue. I don't see a problem with moving Anna Freud to the UK section, but Edmund Bergler definitely belongs in Austria, not in the US section. I am not aware that there's any proof that the 1938 paper mentioned in the article was published after he moved; it could have been before. The fact that it was published in English in the USA doesn't show that he couldn't have had it published there before he moved. Sources are needed if we want to be sure about this (otherwise it would be original research to say that 'After he moved to the USA, in 1938, Bergler published in English, “Preliminary Phases of the Masculine Beating Fantasy“'). I'm still unhappy with having a paragraph about developments in psychoanalysis as the introduction to the entire History section, and will delete it unless it can be properly integrated into the rest of the article, which I doubt it can be. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 08:52, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

* Well, a Hungarian might think saying a Hungarian was Austrian is silly.
* Looking at the sources, there is disagreement whether he arrived in New York in 1937 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C6pGoWWLfhEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+American+Obsession+jennifer+Terry&amp;ei=BSYtSp68DZf2MNvesJkH&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA308,M1] or 1938, although they agree that he vacated his position as a psychoanalyst in in Vienna in 1937.  It seems unreasonable to expect me to believe that given how he settled in the USA between 1937 and 1938, and how he previously published in German in German or Austrian publications, and how the 1938 paper was in English an a US based journal at a time when communication was not what it was today, that he published it in Austria.  Common sense suggests it was published in the USA upon or after his arrival.  Regardless of this, the fact that this was published in the USA and he published no work in Austria after 1937, the main impact of this paper would have been in the USA, not Austria; after 1937 Bergler had no influence in Austria - only in the USA. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 15:32, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
* I have added a comment about the philosopher Popper's views of psychoanalysis.  Popper was Viennese and active at the time both the [[Vienna circle]] and the Vienna school of psychoanalysis were active.  He drew on his observations of Freud and his contemporaries in developing his critique of psychoanalysis in his books, and this serves as one of three archetypes of pseudoscience, alongside Marxism and astrology.  It contests the value of psychoanalysis as a scientific approach. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 15:32, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

Here's an idea, why not merge all those who published in German in one section, leaving France, UK and the USA as they stand?  That will resolve the issue about Ferenczi, as he published in German, as well as Bergler, as he published in English in the USA after 1938.

:Popper's views on psychoanalysis are off-topic here, since they had nothing to do with conversion therapy, something that as far as I know he never wrote about.

:: I disagree, the section is, apart from Krafft-Ebing and one Hungarian, about the Viennese school of psychoanalysis approach to homosexuality as historical background to conversion therapy.

==Sources==

Mish, please do not add Original Research to this article (see WP:NOR). Everything has to be based on the article's sources; we need to correctly reflect what they say. The source regarding Bergler says that he was the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s, and that's all. It ''does not'' say that he was the most important theorist specifically in the United States. It does not matter whether the source was written by an American, or by a Martian, it is a reliable source and that's all the article has to go by regarding Bergler's importance at the moment. If there were other reliable sources that disputed that view, we could note both. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:34, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

== Still some POV issues going on here ==

One of the criticisms of this article was its lack of international scope.  That is not resolved by making out that issues that were primarily of significance in the USA are automatically of equal international significance.  Bergler was an American phenomenon, and his importance there is not reflected here to such a great extent.  Few people here have heard him before I explain about him.  This also applies to NARTH.  Like the APA, it is an national organisation - hence one is called 'American', the other 'National'.  I do not need to justify this by sources - it just is.  NARTH may have effects outside the USA, but that would have to be justified with sources to show that (not the other way around, positives can be proven or disproven - negatives don't work that way - the problematic claim needs to be supported, not the obvious fact).  The paper that is sourced about NARTH is clearly about the US domestic situation, because only US organisations and situations are detailed (apart from a couple of odd refs about Neville Chamberlain for some reason that eludes me), as are all the contributors, credits, funding agents, etc.  So, it is talking about a domestic situation relevant to the USA.  Just because these things are significant in the USA, do not assume they are as significant elsewhere or played out in the same way.  the UK source I quoted from the paper Drescher collaborated with is quite clear about where this connects with the UK - one religious group and no mention of NARTH.  If you want this to have an international scope, then do so not by extrapolating American experience to the rest of the world, but by documenting what happens in the USA, and what happens elsewhere, and what applies to both.  The APA, for example, may be relevant outside of the USA in some contexts, but (for example) in many countries ICD-10 is used rather than DSM-IV - including the UK.  That is because the [[WHO]] is international in scope, while the [[APA]] is national. I need no source for that, because the clue is in the name - just like in NARTH.

So, I am familiar with these policies, and I would refer you to [[WP:Common sense]] which suggests trying to exclude the obvious - that a US national organisation is either American or in the USA simply because one quote doesn't say that when it is all about the situation in the USA and the clue is in the name of the organisation - is silly and borders on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick | Dickishness].  Granted, I am just as much so for persisting with it.  Sure it is all supposed to be accurately sourced, but lots isn't and the sky doesn't fall on our heads; the fundamental priniciple is to improve Wikipedia and guidelines are to guide not dictate.  I would discuss it here, but you don't seem to listen unless I make the change directly, so the only way to rectify certain things in the article seems to be to apply the changes directly in the hope that you get the point.  Sometimes you do, sometimes I let your view pass, sometimes you don't.  Still, I have found reliable source now, and to avoid synthesis by attaching to the existing sentence, I have expanded the sentence to reflect the view of the article - that NARTH is an American organisation which is connected with religious groups opposed to homosexuality.

:Wikipedia's policies apply to everyone, and I am not threatening you by pointing them out. I am trying to save you trouble. Suggesting that policies, including that against original research, be ignored for whatever reason just won't do. It's not acceptable, least of all when the objective is to get an article to Good Article or Featured Article status, and that is my objective here. Regarding POV, that is what it's called when you add things that aren't based on reliable sources, not when you make the article accurately reflect them, which is what I've been trying to do. See WP:NPOV: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV, &quot;Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikimedia principle and a cornerstone of Wikipedia. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. This is non-negotiable and expected of all articles, and of all article editors.&quot; It cannot make any sense to complain about POV problems when you've basically suggested that we should ignore policies like verifiability and no original research, which define what is and isn't POV here.

:The information in the &quot;Religion and reparative therapy&quot; section was badly sourced and misleading. It said of critics of reparative therapy that, 'To support this they claim that Dr Nicolosi is a fundamentalist Catholic pretending to be a secular therapist, that most reparative therapists have a religious background, and that NARTH uses &quot;cod psychology to justify Christian homophobia&quot;.' If you read the Guardian article that was used as a source, it's clear that those comments reflect the views only of Wayne Besen. There's no indication that they are the views of most critics of reparative therapy. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 05:14, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

::I have pointed out to you several times that the connections to religion features substantively in many of the sources here - the APA, Drescher, Zucker, Spizer, and in some papers taking up between 20-40% of the substance of the source cited, yet you have refused to allow this to be reflected in this article.  I have now cited two sources, both from a reliable British national newspaper which details the claims and facts about the connection to religion in some detail - clearly marked when they are claims and when they are verifiable facts.  Your exclusion of this verifiable information from reliable sources and the undue weight in detailing the history of psychoanalysis and other treatments of homosexuality before the growth of the 'ex-gay' movement to such an extent suggests to me a serious neutrality problem and leaves the article unbalanced.  Please leave the tag in place until you have properly addressed these issues - and remember, you do not own this article.  If you wish this article to have international scope, then you need to reflect this - otherwise add 'in the USA' to the title, and relocate the UK and other countries in their own articles.  In the UK this therapy is seen as a relatively new approach being exported primarily by NARTH and the ex-gay movement from the USA, and with strong religious connections.  As reflected in the sources I have cited and you keep removing. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:03, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

:::The first sentence of your comment above is flat out wrong. I have never said that anything in the APA, Drescher, Zucker, or Spitzer that connects conversion therapy with religion should not be here, and have never removed any such material from the article. Actually, you haven't added anything about conversion therapy and religion based on those sources. Instead, you added some information from the Guardian newspaper, which was more about NARTH as an organisation that conversion therapy in general, and parts of which were poorly sourced and misleading, something which I tried to explain to you carefully but which you appear not to understand. That material clearly failed any test of verifiability and due weight, so I had to remove it (the information about NARTH was quite interesting, but it's appropriate for the article on NARTH, not this article, as I pointed out in my edit summary when I removed it, but you haven't responded to that either). It's odd that you would suggest that the article over-emphasises psychoanalysis, given that I've recently cut the section on Freud back considerably. Your complaint about that suggests that you consider conversion therapy and the ex-gay movement as being the same thing, although most sources do not say that, and some contradict it. I'll make the article a little clearer about that. Regarding the POV tag, I'm not going to remove that straight away, but I see no reason why it should remain there forever, simply because you disagree with the article's sources. That is not what a real POV problem looks like. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:02, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

::::Earlier in this discussion you refused to acknowledge that the substantial discussion in the sources on the relation between religion and conversion therapy cited were of any significance and admissible. I had suggested that I would take the time to go through these and extract the relevant information - but given your behaviour so far I am reluctant to waste my time on this, as you will probably find some excuse to delete it. There is nothing wrong with the Guardian as a source, and citing what is claimed or demonstrated in that source. I reflected what they reported without going into undue detail - which was all about the attempted introduction of conversion therapy into the UK - citing the ex-gay movement and NARTH. That is completely relevant to the topic, because that was clear in the title and the text of the source. You have no justification for excluding two reports from a UK national newspaper simply because they don't agree with your POV. I will not be bothering to add anything more to this article for now, because you use policies and guidelines as tools to prevent insertion of material you don't agree with. It is vexatious. I have no more time for it. I will continue to monitor this article because it is an exercise in misrepresentation of the topic which censors certain views expressed in legitimate sources. I am now of the opinion that it is so biased and way off topic that Wikipedia may be better off without it at all.

::::Pruning Freud doesn't really address the problem.  I agree that there needs to be background on the forms of treatment and therapy that has informed this new construction of conversion therapy, but not that it warrants the level of detail where it takes up over 50% of the article.  I do not think that conversion therapy and the ex-gay movement are the same thing.  I agree with the claims described by the Guardian journalist, that its recent development is ideologically motivated.  I also believe that like pasychoanalysis it is unscientific and on a par with alternative medicine and faith healing.  You suggesting that the Guardian is not a verifiable source is stupid.  Balance is not about saying some legitimate sources (i.e. major national newspapers and sections of papers already cited) should be excluded because the proponents of a fringe-theory say it is not like that.  Balance, especially when dealing with fringe theories like this is not to make out it is not a fringe theory, but to allow for the mainstream opinion that it is a dubious form of treatment, and that it is a fringe theory which is generally promoted by religious groups and other social conservatives.  By excluding opinions expressed in the mainstream, such as national newspapers, medical and academic papers, you are damaging the article and thereby Wikipedia.  I just counted 10 pages in my browser that relate to the history before 1960, most of which concerns psychoanalysis; there are about 7 pages in my browser about contemporary issues, mostly about how it developed, studies about it, and various responses to it, and only 1 page that deals with contemporary treatment, which is actually about its proponents saying how good it is.  I have yet to find a section that explains what conversion therapy is.  You would expect that somewhere in the article that would feature substantially - as that is the purpose of Wikipedia, to inform - if I have missed it, maybe you could point me to where there is a description of what happens in contemporary conversion therapy and how it is supposed to work.  Not saying 'oooh - we deal with their gender identity issues that result from childhood trauma' or whatever - what actually happens - that is what many will want to know.  Instead this reads like a text-book, mainly because so much of it comes from a couple of text books.  There is lots about how it works, and why some say it harms, but not about what it actually involves.  Is this is a reflection of the sources?  Do none give any details about the therapeutic process itself?  That is a huge problem, and if nobody knows what happens that adds weight to its being a fringe theory, and we ought to ensure relevant guidelines about how we treat fringe theories are followed.

:The first sentence of your reply above is totally misleading. I never said that connections between conversion therapy and religion could not or should not be mentioned in the article, in fact I said they should be if that could be dealt with in a way that was in accord with policies like NPOV, verification, and due weight. I won't say anything more about that, though, since the record of those conversations is there for anyone to see, and it should be apparent that you're misrepresenting what I said. You also misrepresented what was in the Guardian (which I never said wasn't a reliable source, as you falsely claim). You presented Wayne Besen's views (eg, that 'Dr Nicolosi is a fundamentalist Catholic pretending to be a secular therapist, that most reparative therapists have a religious background, and that NARTH uses &quot;cod psychology to justify Christian homophobia&quot;') as being the views of critics of reparative therapy in general, which was inappropriate and utterly without justification. The details about NARTH's view of IslamOnline and vice versa would be worthwhile for the NARTH article, but not this one. That you have repeatedly ignored these these points and refused to respond does not help matters. The article does clearly say what conversion therapy is, in the lead and the terminology section. Most of your other comments don't warrant a response, including the now repeated and very personal incivility. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:40, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

:The notice you added to the article was for, &quot;When an article or section fails to abide by multiple Wikipedia content policies&quot;. Yet strangely enough, you don't feel a need to respect those policies, and have actually stated that openly several times, both on this talk page and in edit summaries. When I pointed out to you that one of the article's sources didn't support a claim you added to the article, you responded in an edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=295475672], &quot;Probbaly written by an American. Can't have it both ways, either he was the most notable then, or he was the most important in the USA - not important here&quot;. In other words, you considered your opinion more important than what was in the reliable source, rejecting it because you happened to disagree with it. It is incoherent to complain that the article doesn't reflect content policies and simultaneously imply that you will disregard them when you see fit.

:Furthermore, when you add a notice to an article disputing its neutrality, you are meant to discuss this issue on the talk page, yet you have thus far made no real effort to discuss the content issues in question.

It most emphatically does matter whose views they were. To suggest that opinions about a controversial issue expressed by one individual are held by a larger group of people, when there is no evidence they hold those opinions, is misleading and unacceptable. It would be unethical even if it were endorsed by Wikipedia policy, which it is not. Since you've failed to come up with any more acceptable argument, I'm inclined to remove the notice you added.

==Changed definition of conversion therapy==

I have changed the definition of conversion therapy, because of what seems to be a difference of purpose between the statements on this issue by the American Psychological Association and that by the American Psychiatric Association. The first APA's statement seems clearly to offer a definition of conversion therapy, but the second APA's statement doesn't seem to be concerned with doing this. What it says is that 'the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation'.

The &quot;such as&quot; part of that statement implies that there might be things that aren't conversion therapy that are still psychiatric treatment based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation, in which case this phenomneon, though it includes conversion therapy, cannot simply be the same thing. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 03:03, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

==POV==

What is POV and NPOV on Wikipedia is defined by policies that include [[WP:V|Verifiability]], [[WP:NOR|No Original Research]], and [[WP:DUE|due weight]]. Mish has stated above that she believes she can disregard these policies (&quot;I do not need to justify this by sources - it just is.&quot;) because of [[WP:Use_common_sense|common sense]]. It seems to me that the common sense page, which explicitly states that it is not policy or a guideline, is concerned with upholding the spirit of the policies, and does not give editors the right to ignore them when they see fit. I am also concerned that appealing to common sense in this way leaves us with no way of resolving disputes. Mish has told me not to remove the Neutrality disputed notice from the article, but if she has the right to ignore Wikipedia policies when it suits her (to add original research about Edmund Bergler, for example), I don't see why I don't also have this right. So I find it hard to believe that there is a reason why I shouldn't remove the NPOV notice at any time it suits me. I would like to ask other editors for their views on this. Does common sense give Mish the right to add original research to the article, or does it not? May I remove a NPOV notice added by an editor who appears not to accept the policies that define NPOV, or not? [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:07, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

There is no original research about Bergler.  He published in the USA in English, not in Austria in German, in 1938 - the year after or the the year he moved there.  He never published in German in Austria after he left his post in Vienna in 1937.  Placing his work published in the USA in 1938 in Austria when he was no longer employed as an analyst would original research - placing him in the USA from 1938 sticks to the known facts.  I have not ignored a single policy - I have tried to explain something in the talk page to you pointing out the need for common sense.  You have twisted my words into my doing something I have not done, based on a comment I made to you here on the talk page - that is extremely bad faith.  I have not stopped you putting in material backed up by sources - you have stopped me doing so.  I have not developed synthesis or original research in this article, but it could be argued most of the history section is (in the conext of this article) original research based on one comment in the APA statement.  You cannot remove the NPOV tag until you have addressed the issues in a way that you gain consensus to do so.  As yet you do not have that consensus.  you throw around accusations of incivility, when it is you who keeps making bad-faith accusations and alluding to motives when somebody stands up to your bullying dogmatism that is not securely founded in the literature.

:You stated clearly that, &quot;I do not need to justify this by sources - it just is.&quot; That is the exact opposite of what Verifiability states, namely, &quot;The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true.&quot; Based on the fact that you stated something diametically opposed to the verifiability policy, I can only conclude that you do not understand or respect Wikipedia's content policies, the very same policies that you are inconsistently appealing to try to show that the article does not meet NPOV. If you don't accept the policies, why say I shouldn't remove the tag?

:The original research you added about Bergler was firstly that he was &quot;notable&quot; rather than important, and secondly that he was the most important psychoanalytic theorist only in the United States, while the source supported neither of those things. I explained that to you, but you didn't seem to understand or care, just as you (still) don't seem to understand or care that it's seriously wrong to attribute opinions expressed only by one individual to a larger group of people without evidence that they accept them. That was original research, and it had to be removed. Your complaint that most of the history section is original research is without merit, and there's no consensus here that I shouldn't remove the tag. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:42, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

Bergler was important in the USA.  He was not that important in the UK and some other countries.  He was the most important in his time.  But that makes him notable.  If you want to be clear he was important in the USA, fine, but the way this was written made him out to be important period.  That cannot be substantiated, in the way that Freud could be.

I do not need to justify in sources that an american National organisation is American - no.  There is no need when the title is National Association of XYZ and that organisation is in the USA, because that is what 'National' means - it means it is a national organisation, not international.  In the same way the APA is American - needs no source, because the clue is in the name, same with NARTH, you could say that the name is the source.  It is not rocket science.  If NARTH was in the UK, then it would be British, but it isn't, it is in the USA, so it is American. If something is International, it is usually reflected by having International in the name, although not having a country like America, or not having National in the name, can mean either - but National doens't mean International, so international orgainsations do not have National in their name - look it up in a dictionary if you don't believe me.

:See Verifiability again. It doesn't matter what your (or my) personal opinions are regarding Bergler's relative importance in the US or UK. We base this on reliable sources. The source says he was the most important psychoanalytic theorist in the 1950s, and yes, that can be substantiated. Please see page 15 of ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality'', a book which, by the way, is extremely critical of Bergler and the other anti-gay shrinks. Regarding NARTH, its being an American organization or not was never the issue. The question is, is it right to add a qualifying statement saying that it is the most important organization only in the US? The answer has to be no, because the sources don't support that. The simple fact that it is an American organization does not mean that its influence can't extend internationally, and it would be Original Research to say otherwise.

:As for there being misrepresentation embedded within this page, you've given no good reason to think that there is any. The APA is not the only reliable source that uses terms like &quot;conversion therapy&quot; or &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to apply to older approaches, including that of Freud. Jack Drescher has done this also, in ''Sexual Conversion Therapy'', edited with Shidlo and Schroeder. If there are multiple reliable sources stating this, that settles the issue on Wiki. Personal opinions that the APA or Drescher are wrong don't matter here. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:33, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

Yeah, but there's a difference between citing that somebody argues that X Y and Z should be classed as conversion therapy, and making that claim the basis of an article which avoids talking about what conservative therapy today actually is, and ignored the religious aspects beyond a vried mention.  To apply that claim as true for the whole article, turns it into a synthesis, which embeds imbalance and gives things are not central to what happens today undue weight in relation to what the topic is about today.  It renders the majority of the article off-topic.  But, having seen you engage with several contributors, I am aware that you are relatively impervious to criticism, so I am not wasting my time trying to exppain any more.  Especially as you tend to argue with the things you don't agree with but ignore points you cannot dispute.

:Your comments are beside the point, and don't give an accurate assessment either of the article, or of what I've argued on the talk page. If you actually look at the article, you'll see that it gives several different definitions about/interpretations of conversion therapy, based on the fact that these have all appeared in reliable sources. No one of these views is the &quot;basis of the article&quot;. Far from being &quot;synthesis&quot;, this is a good example (imho) of how to handle situations when reliable sources disagree; we report all the main views.

== A neutral view ==

As the editor who removed this article's GA listing I'd like to make a few general points, hopefully to prevent the discussion here becoming too heated.

*It is not fair to suggest that the article now is self-evidently worse than the version which was originally listed as a GA. The reassesment was a routine one being carried out on all articles listed before August 2007, when the GA criteria were substantially added to. That version would be no more likely to be succussful in a GA nomination now than this one would.

*Some good points are being made on both sides, but I'm afraid that to me it seems like shuffling deckchairs on the ''Titanic''. For me, the structure of the article, particularly its focus on developments in various countries simply doesn't work, and gives no sense at all of chronology, or that researchers do not work in isolation but tend to incorporate the ideas of others into their own. That such-and-such a psychotherapist/psychoanalyst/psychologist has used or advocated conversion therapy doesn't seem to me to be automatically worthy of note just because the psychotherapist/etc. him or herself is. This article ought to be focused on telling the story of conversion therapy as accurately and succinctly as is possible. It ought not to be attempting to provide complete coverage of the area; that's why we have references and further reading sections, for those interested in learning more about the subject. &quot;Comprehensive&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;complete&quot;. It seems to me that this article is falling into the trap of confusing the two.

*I look at some sections and wonder whether the subject really warrants that number of words; Freud would be a good example. An important figure in the history of psychoanalysis certainly, but in the history of conversion therapy? I think this may well be an artefact of the article's present structure, which seems to make it overly difficult to maintain focus on ''conversion therapy''.

*On a personal note I view the addition of tags to the head of an article as little short of vandalism, and as a demonstration of goodwill I'd ask the editor who added them to remove them, particularly as a productive discussion on the differences of opinion is already underway here.

OK, done that.  Thanks for your comments, which seem apposite.  I would reiterate my comment that it would be of benefit to include some substance about what Conversion therapy (as practiced today) is in practice, as opposed to history of origins, theory, promotion or critique.  It would also be nice to see some presentation of the claims that, and the arguments it is not, connected with religion in some way, as per balance and NOPV.

:I'd like to think Malleus for his reply. I respect the fact that you disagree with how I have organized the article, but your observations do not change my mind about anything fundamental. You write that, &quot;For me, the structure of the article, particularly its focus on developments in various countries simply doesn't work, and gives no sense at all of chronology, or that researchers do not work in isolation but tend to incorporate the ideas of others into their own.&quot; I do not believe that the article could be written in a way that did not focus on developments in specific countries, and I think it would be utterly impossible to reorganize it in a purely chronological way. If anyone disputes that, then I'm welcome to listen to specific proposals as to how this task could be accomplished, but I'd be surprised if anyone offered any proposals that wouldn't create massive POV/Original Research issues.

:(I do accept that parts of the article might be cut back, and may possibly do that. I have already removed a number of things that struck me as undue or too detailed).

:Malleus's questioning whether Freud is an important figure in the history of conversion therapy (which goes back to his complaint in February this year that the quote from Freud didn't seem relevant) seems to me to reflect a basic misunderstanding of the issue. It is not true that someone has to describe himself or herself as a conversion therapist or say that he or she practices conversion therapy for the article to say that they do this. Reliable sources, including the American Psychiatric Association's position statement in addition to other things, define conversion therapy (and for that matter reparative therapy) in such a way that they do include Freud and other earlier figures, who never used either of those terms, which means that for the purposes of this article Freud indisputably is an important figure in the history of converison therapy. Whether the sources are right or not definitely is not the issue, and it isn't our task as editors to settle that. This has everything to do with Wikipedia's basic content policies and nothing to do with the article's structure. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:57, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

Yes, but to take a brief comment by the APA like that and then apply that backwards historically in the way it has been here - where the detail on the history of psychotherapeutic approaches to homosexuality at a time when it was treated as a psychiatric condition per se exceeds any substance on contemporary conversion therapy treating homosexuality when it is no longer a psychiatric condition - that is original research.  It is one thing commenting that the APA said this, it is another to construct a whole article on that premise. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:27, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

:We have been through this. The APA position statement is a reliable source, and would settle the issue by itself. Even if it didn't, and other sources were needed, they do exist (including Drescher in ''Sexual Conversion Therapy'', which I'll find the exact page reference for if need be). They say essentially the same thing as the APA, and do so more explicitly. Yoshino also deals with Freud as part of the history of conversion therapy. Given that numerous reliable sources state this, there is little sense in saying that it needs to be qualified as only their view; it is definitely the main view, and can be presented as fact. If the various reliable sources apply the term &quot;backwards historically&quot;, we need to respect that.

==Reply to Benjiboi (from his talk page)==

Benjiboi commented on his talk page, &quot;The proponents of conversion therapy are almost exclusively tied to and supported by religious institutions. This should be quite clear in the lede and instead it is muddled with a list of researchers that doesn't make much sense IMHO.&quot; I place my response here, to keep further controversy off his talk page. I think it is probably an overstatement to say that proponents of conversion therapy are almost exclusively tied to or supported by religious institutions (not an overstatement by much, but still an overstatement). There is a reliable source (the article by Kenji Yoshino) stating that &quot;The most high-profile contemporary purveyors of conversion therapy tend to be religious organizations&quot;, and that is in the lead. I have made it slightly clearer. I do not very much care whether the lead contains a list of people who advocated or practiced conversion therapy, and only put it there as a makeshift measure. I welcome alternative suggestions as to what the lead might contain; I now agree with Benjiboi that it needs major improvement.

==Bergler material needs adjusting==

The article said that Bergler, &quot;believed that tolerance was wrong because this would not lead the homosexual to awareness, advocating persecution as the means to seeking, and obtaining, a cure for the condition.&quot; I am not sure that this is necessarily wrong, but it is written in a way that makes it seem to contradict what at least one reliable source (Lewes) says about Bergler. Lewes says on page 155 of ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality'', that Bergler &quot;did not oppose&quot; the movement to decriminalize consensual homosexual sex, but that he was indifferent to to it, which certainly isn't the impression one would get from reading what was said about him in the article. Maybe both of these claims are true in some sense, but I would like the claim I removed left out of the article until that can be clarified. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 05:33, 15 June 2009 (UTC)
: When sources conflict, you need to reflect both. There are around twenty references to Lewes already, which seems disproportionate, and making this article weighted strongly by one or two sources.  Other legitimate sources only strengthen the article. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:01, 16 June 2009 (UTC)
: I have been through the Terry source, and edited Bergler to reflect the source more accurately.  Bergler published in opposition to Kinsey.  In his earlier writing Bergler was not far from Freud in not placing too much hope on curing homosexuality.  Kinsey, and the homosexual emancipation movement that drew on his work, seems to have been a problem for Bergler, and it was in response to this that he set about opposing the idea that homosexuality was a normal human sexual variation, framing it as perversion in neurotic masochistic individuals who were damaged as a result of their childhood relationships with parents.  Initially he problematised what we would today call homophobic people for feeding the neurotic masochism of homoosexuals, as it added to their collection of injustices; however, he changed in this view, and located the blame for this on homosexuals themselves, coming to see them as provoking 'homophobic' reactions in order to feed their masochism and add to the list of injustices they had endured.  It was a corollary of this view that homosexual advocates, like Kinsey, made matters worse for homosexuals, because they 'glorified' homosexuality (although this is self-contradictory in relation to his analysis of masochism), when what was needed was the oppression that would drive people into seeking treatment, and thus therapy.  All apart from the last sentence can be verified as being in Terry, while the last sentence as I have stated it is alluded to there, and drawn from the comments she makes, but not with the specificity with which I have explained it - which is why I have refrained from replacing it in the way I phrased it before; I no longer have Bergler's book, but am looking through my papers to see if I made a copy of this, or noted it, somewhere when I read him - it may take a while.  Everything in the text as it stands is verfiable in Terry, and she has written one of the most complete and widely available histories in this area.

::Lewes is an obviously useful source; the number of references is not relevant so far as I know. Policies are what matter, not personal opinion. I'll look at the article in a moment, and comment on what you've done. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:04, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
::The information you added is much too detailed and more appropriate to Bergler's biography than to this article. In many cases, the relevance specifically to conversion therapy is not clear. This is a problem of due weight again. It needs cutting back. A further problem is that in some cases the information, although not exactly wrong, is presented in a somewhat misleading way. For instance, from the sentence, &quot;Bergler based his own theories on analysis of the novels of literary figures known to be homosexual (e.g., Oscar Wilde, Hermann Melville)&quot;, readers wouldn't know that this applies to the work Bergler did after 1942 and more especially his reaction against Kinsey (see Terry pages 309 to 310). What you added does not perfectly reflect what Terry wrote; the sentence where she discusses this reads, &quot;His assertions were back by little more than tautological statements and eccentric methods, including 'clinical analyses' of such literary figures as Herman Melville, Tennessee Williams, Oscar Wilde, and Marcel Proust.&quot; So even if this level of detail were justified (and it clearly isn't), the material would still need adjusting. It's not true that Bergler based his theories only on his analyses of gay writers. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:52, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I disagree, while the focus on Bergler before 1950 does not need to be documented in any detail, as it clearly states that he was the most important person working in this field in the 1950s, it deserves as much weight as somebody like Freud (who was not the most important person in his time, as Ellis and Hirschfeld were also around).  In discussing Bergler in the 1950s, it should be fairly clear that this is not applying to his work before 1942 - and as his rection to Kinsey is discussed, the context is given. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:08, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
::::If Bergler was the most important theorist in the 1950s, that does suggest that his previous work was worth describing. However, we have to be sure that this article focuses on the main subject. Many of the details you added had little or no real relevance to conversion therapy. Bergler certainly does not deserve as much detail as Freud, since he is historically a much less important writer. By the way, regarding the word &quot;gay&quot;, your argument that it shouldn't be used to describe Bergler's patients because he wouldn't have used it is irrelevant unless you are going to go through this article and systematically replace &quot;gay&quot; with &quot;homosexual.&quot; I don't agree that that change should be made, and I think most other editors wouldn't either. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:15, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I fail to see how you can justify one approach for 'homophobic', a word that was not in currency in the 1950's, and yet use 'gay', which applied from the 1960's on.  This seems inconsistent.  Whether most editors have an issue with 'homosexual' or not is a moot point - nobody has said as much in relation to this article have they?  This was the term that was used when it was a classified as a medical disorder, and the basis for Bergler's treatment was that homosexuality was a sickness that people could be cured of.  He was completely opposed to the notion that this was a valid identity, connotations of which are bound up with the word 'gay'.  What is clear from what I have inserted about Bergler is that while he may not have been as important as Freud in terms of psychotherapy, his legacy in treating homosexuality was greater - because it helped shape popular understanding in a particular way that has persisted through to reparative therapy.  The same cannot be said of Freud, because he did not invest much hope in changing sexual orientation, and never made the claims that Bergler did.  In the context of 1950s USA and after, Bergler is arguably more important in the context of this article. The theory and approach described for reparative therapy seems to owe quite a debt to Bergler, along with exaggerated claims of efficacy.  What has been inserted about the 1950s shows a clear change in emphasis in Berglers theory and approach - ans so while what preceded this, it is not as significant for this article as the situation during the time when he was the most important and influential analyst of homosexuality.

::::They are different terms, and the article can deal with different terms differently. &quot;Gay&quot; is currently the accepted term for a same-sex attracted person, and consensus, I think you will find, is to apply to the term retroactively. It is not likely that there is any consensus for doing so with &quot;homophobic&quot;, and in any case it would be absurd. That word is just a way of saying how nasty anti-gay people are. I am sure they are nasty, but pointing that out with ahistorical, judgmental language is unnecessary, foolish, and not how an encyclopedia should be written. Keep it matter of fact.

::::I note that your recent change from &quot;gay&quot; to &quot;homosexual&quot; (which I've reverted) made matters worse by adding original research, which is forbidden by policy, and something I've already requested that you not do.

It's certainly not in the source. Likewise with Freud, where you wrote, &quot;Freud as inhibitions of normal sexual development, although he denied that this meant that people he regarded as homosexual must be abnormal in other aspects of their lives.&quot; Again, what is the &quot;regarded as homosexual&quot; part doing there? It's irrelevant, and distorts Freud's meaning. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 02:54, 18 June 2009 (UTC)
So did the former - Freud and Krafft-Ebing did not disgnose people as being 'gay'.  You should use the terms they used - if they did not use homosexual, then use the term they used, but they did not treat people who were gay.

Krafft-Ebing used a variety of terms for people he trawled the lunatic asylums for, and ideally you should should those terms.  Freud would have been more likely to describe people using 'inversion' than homosexuality.  You need to go back to the sources and verify what terms were actually used by these authors to esnure accuracy.

There was no 'gay righst movement' in germany pre-WWII, there were a variety of movements, including Ulrich's Urnings, nationalistic homosexual groups, and what Hirschfeld was involved in, which was closer to modern campaigns for homosexual equality that the gay rights movement.

::::I think you misunderstand why 'homosexual' is seen as objectionable to gay people.  It is because of the clinical connotations that arise from it being used in a way that focuses on sexual activity which was at one time treated as a pathology.  In this context - where clinicians and analysts were dealing with 'homosexuality' (as detailed throughout the text), then it is entirely appropriate to use the term 'homosexual', because that is how these clinicians and analysts described their subjects.  I don't personally have any issues about this, but I take your point about modern usage, and respect that.  Whatever I might think about the use is irrelevant.  In the UK, one of the most successful groups was called 'The Campaign for Homosexual Equality' - and although it is a translation, Hirschfeld described himself as homosexual.  There is much less evidence to substantiate calling people 'gay' historically, especially in a piece that focuses on attempts to treat them.  They were not being treated or discussed because they said they were gay, but because they engaged in what were considered as homosexual activities.

Seriously, nobody was treated for being gay when homosexuality was classed as a psychological disorder, they were being treated for being homosexual, all the books I have read say this. Once homosexuality was removed from DSM, then things changed. I have read the books, and I've known people it happened to. I even experienced some of it myself.  Some of what happened to me wasn't because people thought I was gay, but because they thought I was homosexual. The books agree, honest.  It doesn't matter what we say today, or what we would want today - that is what happened.

'Conversion therapy' has become used over the past two decades to describe treatments for homosexuality in a religious context also described as 'reorientation' or 'reparative' therapy.

Is it appropriate to use this term to describe the approaches used by therapists who described their work using different terms before the coinage of these terms?  Such as Krafft-Ebing or Bergler (etc.) here:

* [[Conversion therapy#Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]
* [[Conversion therapy#Edmund Bergler]]

:That isn't neutral. The first sentence is a baseless assertion.

:It is factually wrong to say that 'conversion therapy' refers only to religious attempts at changing homosexuality, and that's perfectly obvious from both of the sources (American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association) used to define conversion therapy in the lead. The American Psychological Association source refers to, &quot;therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy)&quot;. Nothing there to indicate that it must be religious. The American Psychiatric Association source refers to, &quot;psychiatric treatment, such as &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation&quot;. There again, nothing to say it must be religious.

:Here's a quote from the American Psychiatric Source, &quot;In recent years, noted practitioners of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality (16,17,18). The earliest scientific criticisms of the early theories and religious beliefs informing &quot;reparative&quot; or conversion therapies came primarily from sexology researchers (19-27). Later, criticisms emerged from psychoanalytic sources as well (28-39). There has also been an increasing body of religious thought arguing against traditional, biblical interpretations that condemn homosexuality and which underlie religious types of &quot;reparative&quot; therapy (40-46).'

:The first sentence seems to refer only to some practitioners, not all of them, and the last sentence makes it perfectly clear that religious types of reparative therapy are only one kind, and that others may not be religious. If what you were saying were actually correct, both APAs would say so clearly, but they don't. Your entire position is based on a strained and unacceptable interpretation of one sentence from one source. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 06:32, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

OK, let's go through the Spitzer study and peer commentaries together, shall we?

So, looking at Drescher &amp; Zucker's book ''Ex-Gay Research: Analyzing the Spitzer Study and its Relation to Science, Religion, Politics, and Culture'' (2006).

Ch.1

Zucker says that prior to the changes in approach to homosexuality 30 years earlier, 'the literature was replete with various treatment approaches designed to alter a person's same-sex sexual orientation'.  When the approach changed, only a small number continue to regard homosexuality as pathological.  He says that in the 1990's a 'movement of dissenters' arose, led by Socarides (who had never agreed with homosexuality being taken out of DSM-III), claiming that people could change if they wanted.  Socarides and Nicholosi and the dissidents 'have described a technique known as &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to treat both gay men and lesbians' (he cites books written in 1991 and 1994); NARTH was formed in 1992.

So, note Zucker says that there were a variety of approaches, before the 1970's, and does not call these 'conversion therapy', instead he calls 'reparative therapy' a technique in its own right.

Ch.2

Drescher explains how the view that homosexuality was pathological was replaced by the view that it was normal human variation, but that there were always political undercurrents that resisted this idea.  He explains how some elements in society have continued to reject acceptance of homosexuality 'sexual conversion therapists and so called ex-gays have attacked psychiatry [...] for their normalizing claims.'  They have also argued homosexuality is a mental disorder. He goes on to say 'religious and social conservatives aggressively market conversion therapies as both a miracle cure and an alternative to being gay.'  The science of whether change is possible has become subordinated to the politics of whether change is desirable.  This casts homosexuality as behaviour symptomatic of mental illness, moral weakness, or spiritual sickness.  From this understanding, not only is not treating homosexuality morally wrong, but so too is supporting aspirations of normalcy, such as normality of identity, family life, social stability, etc.

So, note that Drescher is clear that there was always a two-fold resistance to acceptance of homosexuality, and this has become focused on 'conversion therapies' since; the resistance has come from social conservatives and from conservative religious groups, who cast homosexuality as either mental or moral illness.

Ch.3

The APA states that in its 1998 statement it opposed any psychiatric treatment, citing 'reparative' or 'conversion' therapies which assumes homosexuality is a mental disorder or that homosexuals should change.  It describes lack of evidence, and states that reparative or conversion therapies are at odds with the scientific position of the APA.  That practitioners of reparative therapy have 'integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional beliefs condemning homosexuality.'  The earliest critiques of theory and religious beliefs that informed 'reparative' or 'conversion' therapies were develpoed by sexologists, and then psychoanalysts.  There has also been religious critique of the religious approach.  The APA makes three recommendations, the first notes that effort to repathologize homosexuality comes not from rigorous scientific or psychiatric research, but through religious and political forces opposed to the civil rights of gay men and lesbians.  It recommends a scientific response to claims made by political or religious groups that homosexuality is and illness and is curable.  The second points out that the concept of 'repair' is based on developmental theories that are scientifically dubious.; there is as much evidence that these therapies harm rather than cure, and that until there is better evidence people refrain from using this type of approach.  The third acknoweldges the difficulties in assessing outcomes and establishing evidence.

Ch.4

Spitzer says there are only a small number of mental health professionals involved in helping people change sexual orientation, this he identifies as 'reparative therapy', he also identifies 'ex-gay' ministries who support gay men and lesbians who seek to change their sexual orientation, citing Exodus International as an example.  In the paper he uses the term 'reparative therapy' to refer to help from 'a mental health professional or ex-gay ministry for the purpose of changing sexual orientation'.  He then questions the APA statement about there being no evidence, citing literature from 1977 relating to the possibility of changing sexual orientation, as well as a systematic review from 2001 that identified 84 relevant sources, a third of which noted a qualitative outcome.  He cites Bieber from 1962 and Socarides from 1978.  Throughout his review of the literature on historcial evidence for change, Spitzer always describes the sources as being about change, yet having just defined 'reparative' and 'conversion' therapies, does not refer to any of these using these terms - and he does not refer to anybody like Krafft-Ebing or Bergler (etc.) at all (and so far I have yet to find a reference to any of these people in this context anywhere).

Ch.5

Bancroft notes that the subjects of Spitzer's study primarily sought to change their sexual orientation because of their religious beliefs.  He also notes that it is not clear what these treatments involved.  He highlights the ethical problem of the imposition of moral values in the guise of medical treatment for psychological issues.  He argues that a treatment model based on the immorality of somebody's sexual orientation is not 'therapy' at all.

Ch.6

Beckstead does not spell out the religious aspect to this approach, be he does give clear references to NARTH in the context of people's motivation for change.

So far what I have established is that there is a small minority of practioners involved in this form of treatment, that the motivation is from religious and social/political conservatives.  The literature cited explains how professionals going back to the 1960's have detailed the possibility of change, but does not specifically cite this as 'reparative' or 'conversion' therapy, using these descriptions for those who have used the descriptions since 1990, and does not refer to the earlier sources in the article at all.  When I have more time, I will work through the rest of the peer reviews in the book, although I will skip the methodological reviews as these aren't particularly relevant to this particular aspect of Spitzer &amp; the APA.

What I am prepared to agree to is that reparative and conversion therapy is not exclusive to religiously motivated people, but that it is seen as having either a religious or ideological (social conservative) motivation.  Perhaps the USA differs from here in that respect, because there is negligible political opposition to homosexuality here, it is mainly religious (but even then ex-gay ministries have not caught on here either, as far as I am aware).

:Regarding Chapter 1: That's irrelevant. One person not using the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; in one chapter of a book does not change how the two APAs define the term. &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; being a technique or not in its own right is not at issue here. 

Yes, but when that person helped write sections of DSM (III-R, IV &amp; IV-TR) for the APA, then his views are relevant, especially in a book on the subject of conversion therapy.

:Regarding Chapter 2: That's also irrelevant. Drescher is not attempting to define &quot;conversion therapy&quot; here, so again, this does not support the claims you were making.

Dismiss all you like, but Drescher chairs the APA's Committee on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Issues, so was instrumental in writing the APA statement, so his views are relevant in a book about conversion therapy

:Regarding Chapter 3: What's the point of this? As I said, it's clear from the APA statement that reparative therapy/conversion therapy isn't by definition a religious approach.

Not so, it is cited for two reasons, because it is in the book, and because it clearly states the religious aspect to this therapy - I have simply expanded the refernces it makes to 'prove' what i cited before was not isolated - it is at the heart of how they define it.

:Regarding Chapter 4: Spitzer's definition of conversion/reparative therapy (which actually isn't a real definition; it's just how he decided to use the term for that paper) is his definition, and has nothing to do with how the APAs use the term. He has been roundly, and quite rightly, criticised for using the term this way.

Spizer chaired the APA taskforce which revised DSM-III as DSM-III-R, worked on DSM-IV; he was made an award by the APA for his contributions.  He also published the study which is central to most of the discussions about conversion therapy, and which is the subject of the book I am citing.

:I have no idea what you think Chapters 5 and 6 prove, and have no response. They don't seem relevant either. You have not shown that the motivation of people who attempt to change sexual orientation is always religious or based on political conservatism, and in any case this issue has nothing to do with the definition of conversion therapy itself.

Well, I haven't finished yet - but the point is I don't have to prove anything - you do.  That is because you are making these novel claims about conversion therapy, that its use predates 1990 and that it did not develop in the context of religous and social conservative values.  yet so far you have not provided a single source that suggests anything else, whereas I have provided plenty of sources to the contrary.

: It may be interesting that many people who try to do this are religious, but that's hardly a good reason for insisting that conversion therapy as such is religious. You are wasting your time trying to use Ex-Gay Research in this way. Your post contains masses and masses of unnecessary and pointless detail, most of which isn't worth addressing, since the issue is perfectly simple: conversion therapy can involve either religious or non-religious approaches.

None of this stuff shows that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; never applies to older approaches.

OK, so moving on, leaving the Spizer study and peer review to one side for now, let's look at what the APA do refer to in this section - a paper from 1940, a couple from the 1960's, and more recent ones, plus Freud, in a paragraph about theories used to 'rationalise' 'reparative therapy' (i.e. historic theories now used to justify reparative therapy).  The only reference to any author in the references you have cited in the history section as doing 'conversion therapy' that I have contested is Freud - Krafft-Ebing, not Bergler, etc. are not listed.  So, I will concentrate on Freud and see if it is possible to establish what they are referring to - but that is not a straightforward task, because they do not give a specific reference. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 11:06, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

OK, I've had a quick look at the Freud reference, and as far as I can see what he does is discusses the difficulty of establishing the congenital and antenatal influencesin the development of what he calls 'inversion'.  Nowhere does he discuss treating homosexuality, although he does give a psychoanalytic explanation for inversion in relation to the Oedipal Complex.  This seems to confirm that he is referred to as inspriring the theory that is used to justify later conversion therapies.  He doesn't discuss the treatment of inversion specifically, although is a short section about prevention - this involves ensuring girls and boys have a certain type of relationship with their parents that ensure they do not develop neuroses that result in inversion, and not sending boys to all-boys boarding schools.  So, from what I can see, he explores possible causes, finds he cannot dismiss biological causes, but tries to explain same-sex sexual attraction as a result of childhood factors, and suggests ways of raising children that would avoid this - but nothing that describes a form of treatment similar to reparative or conversion therapy.  This seems to add weight to the statement at the beginning of the praragraph about his theories being used in the later development of 'conversion' or 'reparative' therapy, not that he engaged in 'conversion therapy'.  I used the source cited in the APA statement 'Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'.  This is why I said that it was synthetic to ascribe conversion therapy to these people, because that can only be done on a misreading of that source - the APA statement.  I will agree that this paragraph in the APA statement is not worded very well, and could be read ambiguously.  But like Spizer, the APA are not perfect.  Going back to the original source, it is fairly clear that nothing in the work of Freud referred to looks like 'conversion therapy', only that the theories contained there may well have influenced its development - something I would wholeheartedly agree with.  Unless I have missed something buried in the text somewhere - if I have, tell me what. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 11:35, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

Lee Beckstead says that for his article, 'sexual reorientation therapy' is used as an umbrella to cover all attempted changes of sexual orientation, while 'conversion' therapy and 'reparative' therapy are used synonymously to signify treatments that are religious in nature and utilise gender-dentity based etiology. (Sexual conversion therapy: ethical, clinical, and research perspectives; Ariel Shidlo &amp;  Jack Drescher, Haworth Press, 2002, p.88).  Jeffrey Ford (p.69) 'Reparative therapy' has become a generic term for almost any approach to healing homosexuality'.  The relationship between religion and conversion therapy is dicussed throughout the book, for example 'Religion and Sexual Orientation Therapy' p.155 (Shroeder &amp; Shidlo). [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 15:00, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

Haldeman's 1991 paper locates the origin of modern conversion therapy to 1982, and out of 11 pages 4 pages are devoted to religious approaches. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 15:19, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

:The American Psychological Association is clear that ''converison therapy'' is a general term for attempts at changing sexual orientation. It does not say that it must be religious, or that it doesn't apply to things before 1990. Nothing you say changes that fact. The American Psychiatric Association definition of conversion/reparative therapy (psychiatric treatment...which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation) also does not define it the way you say it should be.

:The sentence in the American Psychiatric Association statement, 'The theories of &quot;reparative&quot; therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both (10-15)' indicates perfectly clearly that the term does apply to pre-1990 efforts, since sources 10-15 all refer to people who wrote before 1990. You say that this is about &quot;historic theories now used to justify reparative therapy&quot;. Wrong. The APA calls them reparative therapy (a term which it uses interchangeably with converison therapy). That's all there is to it. What Freud was discussing in the source the APA uses isn't relevant; their judgment that he was a conversion/reparative therapist is. Your personal view that conversion therapy should be defined differently carries no weight, and your observation that the APA statement is not worded very well simply dodges the fact that it plainly doesn't say what you want it to. You're free to think that the APA has gotten it wrong, but Wikipedia bases things on reliable sources; it doesn't argue with them, as you are trying to do. Nothing in ''Ex-Gay Research'' states that the term ''conversion therapy'' does not apply to pre-1990 change efforts, and you make no real argument that it does.

:Regarding Beckstead: yes, he defines it differently, but so what? This doesn't cancel out what the two APAs say.

::Sure - and so does what I have put in the UK section, to some extent.  That is the point.  If I were to omit this, it would be inaccurate, wouldn't it?  The sources are contradictory, because there is some confusion over what is/isn't reparative/conversion therapy - and how afr you can apply it backwards.  This is what you have to make sense of.  Because I am right - but so are you.  What I am going to suggest is that we make a compromise here, and work together on this.  The sources are clear that reparative therapy (or whatever they want to call it) does include religious therapeutic approaches - and that these can be distinguished from psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytic approaches because one is about healing in a moral and religious sense, the other about healing in a psychological sense.  Here what we have to do is not dismiss whatever we don't like, but incorporate it.  All I am saying is that the way the article stands at the moment you would hardly know that there is this religious and moral aspect to conversion therapy - and as I have shown you, most writers (including the APA) are up front about that, and for a few that is the basis of their criticism of it.  On the one hand it is criticised because it treats homosexuality as if it were a mental illness, and on the other it treats homosexuality as if it were a moral illness - or simply because it is seen as a sin.  That is the motivations of those engaged in treating.  Then there are those who seek help - some because they cannot deal with the stigma, the loss of family and friends, the burden of what they see as sin, degenerate behaviour, moral or mental illness.  Whether they are right in believing these things doesn't matter - what matters is that this is all fairly well documented, and we need to provide the whole picture - not simply one side of it.  We are supposed to do this throughout Wikipedia - these are the principles.  I'm happy to help you with this, and would prefer not to have it be a battle - because it can actually be quite straightforward, doesn't have to be a problem, and can be quite enjoyable.

I'd like to ask Benjiboi to explain his recent edit to the lead. I realize that it has numerous problems and needs improvement, but I'm frankly not sure that the recent change was an improvement. The second sentence now reads, &quot;Issues with most aspects of conversion therapy has become highly politicized in the United States, Germany and numerous other countries.&quot;  I find this wording rather vague - which issues with exactly what aspects have been politicized? Wouldn't it be better to name them? It's also unusual, since it implies that some issues with aspects of conversion therapy have not been politicized. Again, which ones? What are the sources that support this? I'm not questioning your good faith, but it looks slightly too much like original research. I'm also not sure whether it's an advantage to shift the bit about politics to the second sentence. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:06, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

They apparently are not an officially religious organization, but they definitely do have strong connections with religious groups and individuals. In any event, you can't just change the article to say that NARTH is a &quot;secular organization&quot; (which would be true only in a narrow sense of that expression) without reliable sources to back that up. It's not in accord with [[WP:V|Verifiability]], and neither is the [[WP:NOR|original research]] definition of conversion therapy you added: &quot;a variety of therapy techniques purported to change [[sexual orientation]] of [[gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] people away from a homosexual orientation.&quot; I have removed that, and changed the definition back to what the source actually says (&quot;therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation&quot;).

::Also, the location you (once again, and without consensus) shifted the sentence about politicization to makes no sense.

I never said that conversion therapy was connected with the US only. It is connected to some extent with numerous different countries. However, what sources there are focus more on the United States than on other countries, which really shouldn't be surprising. Maybe the mainstream view in other countries should be covered as well, but if so it may not deserve as much space. Again, regarding reliable sources, it depends how they are used. Starting a discussion at the reliable sources noticeboard may be a good idea. You can find it [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard here].

== Psychological Reports is unacceptable reference ==

&quot;Science is a collective enterprise. Published research papers can be considered scientifically significant to the extent that they influence the thinking and research of other scientists and have an impact on the formulation of new research questions and the design of future studies. Based on this rationale, research studies are often evaluated, in part, by the prestige of the scientific journals in which they are published and by how often they are subsequently cited in the scientific literature by other researchers and professional colleagues. Objective measures are available for both of these criteria, using data published regularly in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Impact factor is widely used by librarians, information scientists, and researchers from a variety of disciplines as an objective indicator of a journal's quality, value, and impact. What are the impact factors for the journals in which the Cameron group has published its papers? Four of the Cameron group's publication outlets – Journal of Psychology, Journal of Psychology and Theology, Omega, and Psychological Reports – were categorized as General Psychology journals in the JCR. They are listed here, along with examples of some of the top- and bottom-ranked journals in that category for 1994 and 1995, and again in 2005. The average number of citations for a paper published in the highest-ranked journals (e.g., Psychological Review in 1994, Psychological Bulletin in 1995) was approximately seven or higher. In other words, articles published in these journals were cited, on average, at least seven times during the two years after their initial publication. All of the journals used by the Cameron group were in the lower half of the rankings and, in many cases, near the bottom. For those journals, the impact factors were substantially less than 1.0, meaning that the average article published in them was not cited at all in the two years after its initial publication. Instead of publishing in highly-respected, scientifically rigorous, and highly influential psychological journals (such as those in the top half of the JCR rankings), most of the Cameron group's research reports have appeared in Psychological Reports. As shown in the table below, Psychological Reports consistently ranks near the bottom of the list for impact. Other approaches to ranking the prestige and significance of journals have similarly ranked Psychological Reports at a low level in comparison to other psychology journals. Psychological Reports publishes a larger number of articles and has a lower rejection rate than is typical for psychology journals. According to JCR in 1994 and 1995, for example, Psychological Reports was the third largest journal for which statistics were collected, publishing 510 articles in 1994 and 504 articles in 1995. Psychological Reports is also different from the vast majority of psychology and social science journals in that it requires contributing authors to pay a fee (in recent years, $27.50 per page). The practice of charging a per-page fee or requiring purchase of preprinted copies of the article is rare in psychological and social science journals. Such per-page fees are not charged by the high-prestige psychology journals (e.g., those published by the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science). Thus, the Cameron group has published its empirical research in academic journals with low prestige and, at least in the case of Psychological Reports, with a low rejection rate and a publication fee required from authors. Given the serious methodological flaws in their survey studies and obituary study, it is reasonable to conclude that the Cameron group's papers would have been rejected by more prestigious scientific journals.&quot; http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/facts_cameron_journals.html

[[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable sources]]: &quot;''Articles should be based upon reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.'' Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made: ''exceptional claims require high-quality sources''.&quot;

[[Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Scholarship]]: &quot;Wikipedia articles should cover ''all significant views, doing so in proportion to their published prominence among the most reliable sources.'' Material that has been vetted by the scholarly community is regarded as reliable; this means published in ''reputable peer-reviewed sources'' or by well-regarded academic presses. ''The scholarly acceptance of a source can be verified by confirming that the source has entered mainstream academic discourse, for example by checking the number of scholarly citations it has received in citation indexes.'' A corollary is that journals in those fields well covered by such indexes, but not included, should be used with caution. ''Isolated studies are usually considered tentative and may change in the light of further academic research. The reliability of a single study depends on the field. Studies relating to complex and abstruse fields, such as medicine, are less definitive. Avoid undue weight when using single studies in such fields. Meta-analyses, textbooks, and scholarly review articles are preferred to provide proper context'', where available.&quot; Thus I expect your apology.

The reference &quot;Nicolosi, Joseph; Byrd, A. Dean; Potts, Richard W. (June 2000), Retrospective self-reports of changes in homosexual orientation: A consumer survey of conversion therapy clients, 86, Psychological Reports, pp. 1071–1088&quot; is unacceptable to Wikipedia under the above cited policies and guidelines, since it is one tentative study published in unreliable source. Thus I am removing undoubtedly unreliable reference. --[[User:Destinero|Destinero]] ([[User talk:Destinero|talk]]) 10:49, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

::I agree with this, Destinero, it is not policy to use unreliable sources that support a fringe view in favour of reliable sources that criticise that view.  I support your edits, I do not support BornGay's reversals. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 11:06, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:::To Destinero: I am not going to apologize to you. Your suggestion that I should is childish, and bad wiki-etiquette. Let's be clear what is actually at issue here: should the article mention what Nicolosi et al think, or shouldn't it? Mentioning their views is something completely different from supporting them, and it's crucial to make that distinction. Part of the purpose of this article is to explain to readers what supporters of conversion therapy think, and in my view it is foolish to remove material (such as Nicolosi's study) that helps to do that. I don't consider it especially important that this particular study be mentioned, but neither do I think that removing it serves any good purpose. Making enormously long quotatons from Wikipedia's policies is an annoying waste of talk page space, and really doesn't help you make your case. The reliability of ''Psychological Reports'' is an issue that has been discussed before on other articles, and there is no general agreement that it cannot be used. For example, see the comments by DGG, a very experienced and fair administrator, on this issue[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Primal_therapy#New_issue_regarding_Psychological_Reportshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Primal_therapy#New_issue_regarding_Psychological_Reports]. His conclusion was that, &quot;It is not of such low quality that material in it can be rejected altogther, nor or such high quality that everything in it can be trusted&quot;, which seems reasonable.

:::To Mish: Which edits by Desitnero in particular do you agree with and why? Just saying that you agree with them, without being specific or giving an explanation, is not helpful. Would you agree with any edit Destinero made? Destinero's edits are problematic for many reasons (several of them have violated due weight, NPOV, and other policies), and I am not convinced that they shouldn't be reverted simply because for some reason you think they're good. In my view they are quite unhelpful, and if there is going to be a consensus among editors on this page that they shouldn't be reverted, I will simply stop working on this article. I don't see the point in trying to improve an article when a group of editors insist on making changes that lower its quality and violate its neutrality.

::I agree that something needs to be there about NARTH, and it needs to be related to the mainstream views on NARTH.  If their reports are dismissed, and of poor quality, then I can see no justification in citing claims made in those reports directly.  Especially when they are deemed to be problematic claims that have no evidence to support them.  By all means say that NARTH claim s things, but not citing doubtful statistics, then add that they are generally dismissed by experts.  Otherwise, the people reading this article might be misled into assuming that they are credible.  Their credibility is not generally acknowledged (apart from by NARTH and a few people with a religious interest in 'bigging-up' reparative therapy).  We can no more be involved in that than we can in giving conspiracy theories credibility. [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:15, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:::I'm not going to restore the mention of that study right away. That's partly because I don't see the study as being of crucial importance, and partly because there is no consensus at the moment for restoring it. However, the reason given for removing it was completely mistaken, and I will, possibly, be restoring it at some stage in the future, if that seems appropriate. It's simply not true that ''Psychological Reports'' can never be used as a source, and I see little reason to worry that readers will decide that conversion therapy is credible simply because Nicolosi's or NARTH's views are mentioned (not presented as fact, but just mentioned) in the article.

::::::I'm happy to let you work that one out with Destinero. I'd appreciate you running it through here, though, before posting it.  To be honest, I'm more interested in the history section, because I have read most of the original texts.  I have taken the liberty of reorganising the History section along the lines you suggested on the spave you linked to earlier.  I want to finish playing with it, then when I'm happy with it, I'll bring it here for feedback.  I think it is important to have that section, but to try and reduce it as much as possible.  I think this is part of the problem with the article, that it is so large with so many sections, it tends to detract from the main body of text on contemporary issues, and when people get there it is fragmented, and they don't see 'the whole', and start to chip away at bits that in isolation look like they give undue weight to stuff.  Somehow, that needs to be attended to in a way that is less fragmented and the balance becomes clearer.

I am reorganising the history chronologically in the following way:

* 19th Century
* 20th Century: Europe up to WW2
* 20th Century: USA up to WW2
* 20th Century: Europe WW2 to 2000
* 20th Century: USA WW2 to 2000
* 21st Century: Europe
* 21st Century: USA

The second half of the 20th Century might need to be broken down somewhere between 1969 &amp; 1973, but I'm not thinking about that, the sections aren't too long this way, and there aren't so many.  I've reduced Krafft-Ebing substantially, and Freud a bit,  removed a couple of entries, halved Hirschfeld, etc.  I'm mainly focusing on the European stuff, because I'm not that interested in most of the USA stuff beyond Bergler and Kinsey.  I've split Europe and USA because I feel others would be better tacking the USA, and I try to avoid USA articles as there are plenty of US editors.  Also, historically (up to about 1936 anyway) the main interplay was between UK, Germany &amp; Austria.  We can look at how well that split works after WW2 later.

:Changing the history section in any significant way (and it does obviously require significant change, including abandoning the country-by-country organization, which wasn't such a great idea) needs consensus. It's true that I went ahead and changed it without consensus, but looking back I wish I hadn't done that. It might have produced a much better result if I had discussed matters beforehand. So I would request that you not change it again without further discussion. That's not to reject your proposed changes, I simply haven't had a chance to look at them carefully yet.

That we copy the section(s), set up a sandbox linked from here, and work through the section(s) until we are happy with it/them, then once consensus is achieved, we replace what is on the main page, and that becomes the consensus version - and we all try to ensure no major changes are made without discussion here. Otherwise it is simply not fair to the readers to go through this whenever an editor comes here who has issues with the way the article is now.  I am not clear that what we have now has been arrived at through consensus, and that is part of the problem.

&quot;The authors present 3 arguments in favor of providing reorientation and related services: (a) respect for the autonomy and
self-determination of persons, (b) respect for valuative frameworks, creeds, and religious values regarding the moral status of same-sex behavior, and (c) service provision given the scientific evidence that efforts to change thoughts, behaviors, and feeling-based sexual orientation can be successful.&quot;

It's gratuitous, in that it's not even about conversion therapy specifically.

:::::what is needed is a source that refers to the relevance of such randomised trials to the evidence on conversion therapy.  It is a bit like my comment about this being pseudo-science - Freud is in the history as having some relationship to conversion therapy, and Freudian psychoaonalysis was determined to be pseudoscience by Popper - but because conversion therapy did not exist, we seem unable to talk about Popper's critique of Freud (as he never discusses conversion therapy), while we are able to talk about Freud (who didn't either, but has been linked historically to the development of conversion therapy. Most academics know it is all smoke-and-mirrors, but it is a matter of tracking down the sources which say this.  Like this one [[http://www.iglss.org/media/files/Angles_41.pdf]], or this one [[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/328/7445/E287?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=%22conversion+therapy%22&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=date&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT]].  Rejecting papers in leading international journals just because they are British is odd.  These journals tend to be cited in the USA as well as the UK, and just because Conversion Therapy is a bigger issue in the USA than the UK is not relevant.  People from the USA publish in the UK because it is not the USA, for very good reasons.  Drescher has done so, Green has done so for many years, and there are others.  One of the reasons Conversion Therapy is not the problem it has become in the USA is because of the way it has been managed in UK medical and psych journals.  They need to be cited, because they have been more effective in showing up the problems inherent in this type of therapy in a way that has not been managed nearly so well in the USA.

That's easy to change.  Take this sentence here:

* Mainstream American medical and scientific organizations have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful.[9][2] The ethics guidelines of major mental health organizations in the United States vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy (American Psychological Association), to recommendations that ethical practitioners refrain from practicing conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or from referring patients to those who do (American Counseling Association).[2][7][10] Sigmund Freud was a major influence on the development of conversion therapy, although he was skeptical of its effectiveness.[5]

* Mainstream medical and scientific organizations in the United States and other countries have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful.[9][2] The ethics guidelines of major mental health organizations in North America and Europe vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy (American Psychological Association), to recommendations that ethical practitioners refrain from practicing conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or from referring patients to those who do (American Counseling Association).[2][7][10]

== sandbox for history ==

Hi, before you make too many changes to history, perhaps you could look at the sandbox I set up for the history.

[[User:MishMich/CV history]]

I have merged all the European history, and separated out some major timescales.  I have merged all countries for pre 20th Century, but kept USA and Europe separate as I am less knowledgeable about the USA (apart from Bergler &amp; Kinsey etc.).  I have had a comment that the USA &amp; Europe needs to be merged from 20th Century inwards - but I have left it so that this can be worked on by somebody who is more interested in the USA while I work through the European stuff.  Could use some material from Australia/NZ as well I guess.  If you could work on reducing the USA sections, I will get back to slimming the European stuff, and then have a go at merging the two.  Then when we are agreed on the revised section we can replace the section in a way that does not disrupt the article for any readers while this gets sorted out. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:32, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

:My first comment is that I think there's still a lot of stuff there that quite likely doesn't belong in the article at all. It's questionable at best if Schrenck-Notzing or Charcot deserve any mention, and the same can be said for everything else in the 19th century section. Cutting back the Krafft-Ebing material is a step in the right direction, but I suspect that deleting it altogether might be a better option. The problem with all of these figures is that there's susprisingly little evidence that they influenced the later development of conversion therapy.

:Freud is a completely different case; all the relevant sources indicate that he was a massive influence on conversion therapy, despite the way it diverged from his somewhat more tolerant views. I'm not sure the Freud material should be cut back at all, though maybe it could be abbreviated a little. The later paragraphs dealing with Vinchon, Nacht, Ferenczi, Boehm, Bergler, and Klein are better, and are closer to how the article should read. The Nazi material is undue, and would be better abbreviated to a sentence or two at most.

:The material on Hirschfeld is still a little too long; it probably needs only a sentence or two, dealing with how he was willing to refer gay people who wanted to change to psychoanalysts such as Sadger. Mentioning his comparison of homosexuality to having a hare lip is somewhat pointless. In the US section, I think the material on Brill probably should be abbreviated a little more. I'm not at all sure whether Stekel or Deutsch should be mentioned or not; Lewes barely deals with Stekel, and Yoshino mentions him only in a footnote. La Forest Potter probably doesn't belong there at all, unless there is some mention of him in primary sources (books by conversion therapists).

:The organization of the history section in your proposed version is definitely better than what is there now, but it would probably be better yet to move toward a more purely chronological arrangement, since that is how the most relevant sources (Lewes, Drescher, and Yoshino) deal with the subject. Personally, I've reached the conclusion that the history section should focus almost entirely on the Freudian and quasi-Freudian approaches, with other methods deserving only a brief mention, as this is how the sources discuss the history of the subject. The assorted non-Freudian methods (surgery, ex-gay ministries, and so on) would be better dealt with in different ways, in the contemporary methods section. This is because there appear to be no sources that deal with them as part of the history of conversion therapy (though some describe them as methods of conversion therapy).

:Other things (Gunter Dorner's work, Lacan, the chemical castration of Alan Turing) shouldn't be anywhere in the article, as they're entirely undue. Probably so are Arthur Janov and the primal scream material. Eysenck (and also Srnec and Freund, and Seligman on aversion therapy) wouldn't belong in the history section, though possibly mentioning their work might be appropriate in a different part of the article. There are a lot of other things I'm still unsure about. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:59, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks, I won't be doing anything with it for a couple days, but will go through the above and see what I can do.

== Richard Cohen ==

I recently came across an article about [[Richard A. Cohen]], who is described as a leading practitioner of conversion therapy.  He's not mentioned here.  If he is, should he be mentioned here - or if not should his biography be amended accordingly? Not sure how to go about the latter, as it has a verifiable source. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 16:10, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

:Actually Cohen is mentioned, in the Non-professional methods subsection of &quot;Contemporary theories and techniques.&quot; I'm reasonably confident that Cohen should be mentioned here, and don't think he ought to be removed, although I'm unsure exactly how much space he deserves. He may have received more attention in the popular media than in books and papers dealing with conversion therapy. This points to the need to take newspaper articles and other media sources into account as well as books and articles in journals.

:::This section is problematic. It currently states that, &quot;Some methods, including coaching, are outside the purview of professional health associations, and hence are not required to follow professional ethics guidelines&quot;, something that, for the record, I found in earlier versions of this article, and readded to the current version without checking to see whether it was correct. I am not sure there is anything in the source that justifies that statement. The closest the source seems to come to it is, &quot;To exacerbate the potential harm done to naïve, shameridden counselees, many of these programs operate under the formidable auspices of the Christian church, and outside the jurisdiction of any professional organization that might impose ethical standards of practice and accountability on them.&quot; What that appears to mean is that some ''programs'' operate outside the jurisdication of professional organizations, not that the ''methods'' the programs use are necessarily outside their jurisdiction (it says nothing about coaching being such a method, for instance). So I'm going to remove that, and give the section a different title, as it is largely about Cohen. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:38, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

== Ex-pedophiles ==

It appears that many programs and policies of the ex-gay movement are based on similar work done by psychiatrists that have been trying to re-orientate convicted pedophiles from the deviant sexual behavior. It would be interesting if relevant information on this could be added in the article. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 12:13, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

== Revised Freud section ==

I have been working on the history section of the article in my sandbox [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/Sandbox]. Most of it is not yet up to an acceptable standard, but in my view the section on Freud is good enough to replace what is currently in the article. This version is somewhat abbreviated, better organized, and includes page references, so I will transfer it to the article if there are no objections. I have included as much information about Steinach as seems relevant, so if agreement is reached to use this version, I will delete the section on Steinach when I make the change.

== Delete Krafft-Ebing ==

I think the next thing that should be done with the article is to delete the Krafft-Ebing section.

== New APA resolution ==

This is from Yahoo News, and there's nothing on the APA site, but this is one to watch out for in the newspapers, and presumably an official statement:

[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090805/ap_on_re_us/us_psychologists_gays Psychologists repudiate gay-to-straight therapy]

The American Psychological Association declared Wednesday that mental health professionals should not tell gay clients they can become straight through therapy or other treatments.

Instead, the APA urged therapists to consider multiple options — that could range from celibacy to switching churches — for helping clients whose sexual orientation and religious faith conflict.

In a resolution adopted on a 125-to-4 vote by the APA's governing council, and in a comprehensive report based on two years of research, the 150,000-member association put itself firmly on record in opposition of so-called &quot;reparative therapy&quot; which seeks to change sexual orientation.

No solid evidence exists that such change is likely, says the report, and some research suggests that efforts to produce change could be harmful, inducing depression and suicidal tendencies.

The APA had criticized reparative therapy in the past, but a six-member task force added weight to this position by examining 83 studies on sexual orientation change conducted since 1960. Its comprehensive report was endorsed by the APA's governing council in Toronto, where the association's annual meeting is being held this weekend.

The report breaks new ground in its detailed and nuanced assessment of how therapists should deal with gay clients struggling to remain loyal to a religious faith that disapproves of homosexuality.

::: Yes, except now it is backed up with firm evidence, so it shifts from not appearing to work and likely to cause harm to does not work and is harmful - plus there is an implicit warning to therapists that this is not recommended, so they shouldn't be steering clients in that direction.

::::The Wall Street Journal ran it with the subtitle: Psychological Association Revises Treatment Guidelines to Allow Counselors to Help Clients Reject Their Same-Sex Attractions [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124950491516608883.html] Also interesting is an acknowledgement that &quot;sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.&quot;  So even though sexual orientation doesn't change, sexual orientation identity does.  It also gives a great review of ex-gay groups: &quot;For instance, participants reported benefits from mutual support groups, both sexual-minority affirming and ex-gay groups.&quot;  One of the biggest things is that it recognizes the benefits of celibacy: &quot;Some religious individuals may wish to resolve the tension between values and sexual orientation by choosing celibacy (sexual abstinence) ... acting on same-sex sexual attractions may not be fulfilling solutions. Licensed mental health providers may approach such a situation by neither rejecting nor promoting celibacy.&quot;  According to Judith Glassgold, who chaired the APA's task force on the issue, the report &quot;acknowledges that, for some people, religious identity is such an important part of their lives, it may transcend everything else.&quot; I think this is a great victory for LGBT people with unwanted homosexual attractions. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 00:42, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
: I'd go along with that, although I would not use POV terms like 'victory'.  The only people who win through this are people who will be less likely to be pressured into trying to change their homosexual orientation (and those they end up married to).  The construction of a religious celibate homosexual identity that involves rejection of lesbian and gay identity, is not LGBT-affirming - it is celibate religious homosexual affirming.  While I fully support anybody being celibate for religious reasons, whatever their sexuality, it does not belong in this article.  How about creating an article on this subject?  Having been a celibate Christian myself in the past, and a novice in a religious order, I do know a bit about the history of celibacy - so I'd be willing to help you on this.  My own view is that celibacy is a calling, not a rule, and when undertaken seriously is a sexuality in its own right.  [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:20, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
:: It is also a victory for LGBT people who want to pursue same-sex relationships.  The overall theme was that the client should be able to determine their own goals, without worrying about the abusive practices of therapy of yesteryear.  This is a victory for everyone.  The only people who loose are those who wish to force their views on others, whether they are religious people who don't think LGBT people should be allowed to pursue same-sex relationships, or LGBT people who don't think LGBT people should be allowed to pursue celibacy or opposite-sex relationships.  Not that all religious people and LGBT people think that way, but enough cause consternation.  I still don't understand the difference between LGBT affirming and homosexual affirming, whether it be celibate religious or sexually active secular.  The point is that regardless of their successful change in sexual orientation identity, the underlining sexual orientation has not changed.  Therefore, they are still LGBT people, and any group that advocates their cause is LGBT affirming.  You say that celibacy is a sexuality.  Does that mean sexuality is a choice?  Celibacy is an interesting topic.  I too used to be celibate.  I'm probably more interested in a broader group of LGBT people - those who have successfully changed their sexual orientation identity.  I am struggling to find a place for it.  I don't like the term ex-gay, and conversion therapy is too specific of a category.  Ego-dystonic sexual orientation in my mind is only for people with associated disorders, but I guess those would be the people going to therapy.  Do you have any suggestions?

== History section ==

The history section is not really an appropriate place for long quotations, especially not those that repeat other parts of the article. Some overlap with other parts of the article is inevitable, but it should be kept to a minimum. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 20:35, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

Having looked again, I take back the suggestion that Destinero's addition repeats other parts of the article, but it remains true that quoting large chunks of text in that way is not a good approach.

== Major changes needed here ==

I no longer have much confidence in the way this article is organized. Malleus rather politely told me that it was no good, but I rejected his criticism (see talk archive 5). Thinking about it, however, I think maybe Malleus has a point. I remain doubtful that purely chronological organization would work, but the country by country organization that is here at the moment is not ideal (a large portion of rather important information that doesn't fit into the country by country arrangement had to be excluded for this reason, while some of the information that is here may be unnecessarily detailed). It might be possible to develop some compromise between these models. Where article content is concerned, I am now more receptive to the argument that there need to be sources to establish that something is conversion/reparative therapy before mentioning it here, but I still need to think about that. To any of the several editors who've complained about how I have edited the article, I'd like to say that I have listened to your arguments, and would like to discuss any of the major changes that may be needed. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:52, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I appreciate your frankness, and wish you luck, but I no longer feel I can contribute.  I don't agree with what the contributor said that was deleted from the discussion, both for the way it was said, and because I do not think reverting the article to the start is the answer.  What I would suggest would be reverting the article to a version that preceded the insertion of the material that is problematic, and then go through what was added subequently and selectively re-introduce what helped improve the article but leaving out what hasn't.  That might be better done in a sandbox, and then re-introduced, and interested editors could make comments and assist with editing in a less heated environment that on a live article.  In the process, the best way to re-organise the article may become clearer, and doing this with hindsight may help to see more clearly what was valuable, what worked, what improved the article and what did not. It is a lot of work, but as you seem very committed to this article, I am sure you will manage it.  I would also ask you to keep in mind some of the points I have made, as they were intended constructively, and may be relevant for some of the material you wish to retain/reinsert.

===as changes are being made===
There isn't much, if any, mention of converting people with heterosexual orientations to homosexual orientations. This might seem facetious, but the absence of info on that is quite telling. Anyhow, this might be easier to address: the article presents sexual orientation as a dichotomy, but models as old as Kinsey's are continuous, and some newer models are multidimensional. Do any conversion therapies purport to move someone from a 5 or 6 on the Kinsey scale to a 1 or 2?

== American medical consensus ==

User Joshuajohanson has recently added a paragraph about the new American Psychological Association resolution to the American medical consensus section (eg, the paragraph that starts, &quot;Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions...&quot;). Now this new resolution is certainly important and it should be taken into account, but I am very displeased with the way that this paragraph has been added. It does not make sense to have a (very long) direct quotation from the APA for this particular resolution while everything else in that section is a ''summary'' of what the various professional bodies have said. There is ''nothing'' about this new resolution that means that it needs to be explained through a direct quotation when all the previous resolutions have been summarised. This combination of summary with direct quotation reads very poorly, and effect is jarring and confusing. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 21:40, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
:I did not put in a paragrph.  I put in a summary, which was rejected, so I put in a small quote which was replaced with a paragraph.  I agree with you, but simply removing is also uncalled for.  Really the whole thing needs to be reworked because the consensus now is that psychotherapy can change sexual orientation identity and &quot;There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation.&quot;  Old methods are ineffective at changing sexual orientation, but recent ones have yet to be determined whether they are effective or not at changing sexual orientation.  After all, it's not like anyone is born gay.  Sexual orientation developes across a person's lifetime.

::::::From reading the resolution, it seems to me that the main jist of what they are saying is that people should be able to determine their own destinies.  There is nothing wrong with an LGB identity which includes pursuing same-sex relationships, and there is nothing wrong with a religious identity which includes celibacy or faithfulness in an opposite sex relationship.  There is no evidence whether or not recent approaches can change sexual orientation, since all research on the subject has been done on older approaches.  Furthermore, promising a change in sexual orientation when one is not possible is damaging, so they recommend not promising clients a complete change in sexual orientation.  However, psychotherapy has been effective in changing a client's sexual orientation identity, behaviors and values, which have enabled clients to a live a life in accordance with their religious identity, which may be stronger then their sexual identity.  Other clients have chosen to alter their religious identity to fit their sexual identity.  Both identities are valid, and the therapist should help the client determine their own identity, without giving preference to either the sexual identity or religious identity.

Joshuajohanson started the ball rolling by adding a statement about the resolution without proposing the change on the talk page first; Destinero found that unacceptable, leading Joshuajohanson to add a long direct quotation, which in my view did not improve anything but only confused matters.

I would like to ask user:Whatever404 why he reverted to the article to that particular version. It's unclear to me what good reason there could be for doing that. That version is inferior in a number of respects to more recent versions - the lead, in particular, is less polished.

With all respect to Destinero and Joshuajohanson, both of whom have been trying to change that version by adding [[WP:UNDUE]] things and making it longer and more complicated, I think it is best to keep the lead as short and simple as it can be while still conveying the main points. If you don't like that version and want to change it, then you need to discuss the issue and get consensus on talk page, as I've pointed out several times.

:Whoa, I didn't restore anything! All I did was protect and add a protection icon.

::I have had a second look, and you appear to be correct. I'm sorry if I misunderstood what happened; apparently I didn't check carefully enough. It should be pointed out that the current version of the lead contains a glaring error; it attributes a statement to the American Psychological Association that was actually made by the American Psychiatric Association. Destinero corrected that (which I think was the only helpful change he made to the lead), but Whatever404's edit undid the correction.

== Freud and Dorner ==

There seems to be a new content dispute, this time over the material on Sigmund Freud and Gunter Dorner. The way to determine what is appropriate content for the article is to look at what the reliable sources say about conversion therapy. There are plenty of sources that indicate that Freud was an enormous influence on the development of conversion therapy, and so the material on him is certainly relevant and should stay here. That includes Freud's attempts at treating his lesbian patient, which have been specifically described (by Jack Drescher, in a reliable source) as a form of reparative therapy. Gunter Dorner is an entirely different story; there isn't even a single source that describes what he did as conversion therapy, so really it has no relevance at all and should be removed. In the interests of full disclosure, I was the one who added the Dorner material in the first place, but that seems like a mistake to me now. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:33, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
:Freud has a child article which '''was''' correctly linked until you edited it out '''twice''' (while bizarrely enough accusing '''me''' of edit warring!). The bulk of the content belongs in Freud's article and not here. I am open to discussion on Dorner; I note he does ''not'' have a child article, so any content deemed notable and appropriate must be in ''this'' article. [[User:KillerChihuahua|KillerChihuahua]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:KillerChihuahua|?!?]]&lt;/sup&gt;[[User:Heimstern/Ignoring incivility|Advice]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:37, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
::The material on Freud does belong here. That's because this is an article about conversion therapy (also called reparative therapy), and multiple sources establish that Freud was an enormous influence on conversion therapy. Freud has also been described by reliable sources as practicing reparative therapy, so how is it not relevant?
::As for Dorner, there is no reason why the content about what he did &quot;must&quot; be here, since there's not even one source to show that it is conversion therapy or has anything to do with conversion therapy. Regarding edit warring, I was not trying to accuse you of this - simply observing that as an administrator, and one who recently protected the article due to content disputes, it would be bad form to start doing multiple reverts. I shouldn't be doing it either, of course, but then ADM's changes, which started the latest round of reverts, ought to have been discussed first. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:04, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
:You have, alas, failed to respond to anything I've said in any helpful or productvie way. You say Freud was important and should be included; no argument. However, how much should be included? And there is '''no''' question that there should be a link to the main article. When there are child articiles, a brief summary is placed here, then a main template is placed with the summary. You have removed the template, and greatly expanded the content, creating dup0lication and going against standard practice.
:Regarding Dorner, I stated that &quot;any content '''deemed notable and appropriate''' must be in ''this'' article&quot;; I most certainly did not say anything he did &quot;must be here&quot; as you erroneously claim. Igf its not notable or pertinent, then by all means eliminate it. 
:REgarding your &quot;edit warring&quot; comment: you were rude and the warning was inappropriate. Do you often walk up to newlyweds and tell them not to screw around on each other? No? Then by all means, reconsider warning people to not do something they've shown no sign of doing. It s ironic that you were edit warring yourself when you made the comment!

::Look, this discussion seems to have got off on the wrong foot. I am sorry if you find my comments rude, I honestly didn't intend them that way. I'm afraid, however, that, from my perspective, it is you who has failed to respond to my points. Plenty of reliable sources indicate that Freud's work is relevant to or forms part of conversion therapy. That establishes that the content is appropriate, and that's the important point. ADM discussed nothing before cutting out a crucially relevant part of the article, which is necessary to readers to understand later developments in conversion therapy and can most usefully be included here. Turning it into a different article wasn't a good idea at all, not if that is the only content it is going to include (it makes no sense to appeal to the existence of a child article if it is not clear that the article should exist, which I'm still not sure about). The Dorner material is all totally irrelevant, as there aren't any sources that indicate a connection with converison therapy. You might have considered that before deciding to readd it.

::You say that, &quot;When there are child articiles, a brief summary is placed here&quot;. If someone (I don't necessarily mean anyone in particular) were really determined to follow that approach, then probably every section of this article could be spun off into a different article, and this article would then be reduced to nothing but a shell, consisting of a handful of brief summaries. Does that really seem like a good idea? [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:04, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
::: I think that because Freud didn't hold much confidence in changing sexual orientation, but because of his significance, a separate article on his views on homosexuality makes sense, with a summary here that points out he looked at the matter, but considered it pointless, and linking to the main article.  What we have here is too much of his views on homosexuality, which is of limited relevance to the topic as a whole. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:12, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
:::: Freud's lack of confidence in changing sexual orientation concerned mainly his awareness of the limitations of psychoanalysis, which he regarded as poorly suited to this task. He seems in fact to have been quite certain that homosexuality could be changed through hypnosis, and he was optimistic about the possibilities of changing homosexuality through surgery (an optimism that was quite misplaced, as it turned out). The issue is in any case not necessarily relevant, since the sources show that Freud was a crucial influence on conversion therapy, regardless of his scepticism about psychoanalysis as a change method. A separate article on Freud's views about homosexuality may nevertheless be justified, but if so what content should be here and what should be there needs to be carefully discussed here first; it shouldn't just be thrown from one article to another without talking about it first. You're right that not all of the material in the Freud section here is directly relevant, but it is helpful background material nonetheless. Similar material is included about many subsequent figures, and it really will not do to remove it without discussion. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:21, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
:::: It's perfectly reasonable to suggest that the Freud section could be cut back somewhat, and I am not necessarily opposed to that (I have cut it back myself, several times already). But look at the material ADM cut out [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=310541471&amp;oldid=310512800]. Most of it wasn't material that might better be in different articles - it was ''directly'' relevant here, since it concerned things that Freud actually did that have been described as conversion/reparative therapy, including his attempt to treat a lesbian patient. ADM may be right that some material can go, but it should hardly have been ''that'' material. The recent bout of edit warring could have been avoided entirely if he had simply discussed his concerns on the talk page.

== Revising Freud section ==

In response to some of the comments here, I'm going to try to cut the Freud section back into something more reasonable and on-topic. I am working on a revised version in my sandbox. When I have something that I think is good enough to go in the article, I will comment here, and make the edit if there is agreement. In the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if ADM's version of that section not be restored, since his approach to cutting it back was less than careful and removed much appropriate material.

== Changes to the lead ==

Hyper3, the changes you want to make to the lead are not backed up by the sources you used. The first one [http://www.examiner.com/x-4107-Gay--Lesbian-Issues-Examiner~y2009m8d5-APA-report--Gay-conversion-therapy-can-cause-depression-and-suicide-attempts] does not say anything about the definition of conversion therapy, or how opponents in particular define it, and the second one [http://www.narth.com/docs/journalsummary.html] does not even use the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, and is therefore irrelevant. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:44, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;Hyper3's latest revert [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=310791960&amp;oldid=310790613] violates the three revert rule, [[WP:3RR]], and this is a blockable offense. I have warned this user of this&lt;/s&gt;. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:52, 29 August 2009 (UTC) Looking again, I am not sure that this is a violation of 3RR. It is however blatant edit warring, and the effect of it has been to introduce material into the article that is clearly not supported by the sources used. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:02, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

:The previous definition has no sources, mine at least has something. The sources do not need to say anything about the definition of conversion therapy; all they need to do is define it in the course of making a summary of their position. NARTH will of course not use the term &quot;conversion therapy.&quot; In the footnote to the phrase quoted, they show their unhappiness in referring to gays and lesbians, believing that it begs the question. The examiner clearly uses the commonly phrased reference to gays and lesbians. Both sources are valid.
:As for edit warring, I have been responding to your critique; you have been reverting out of hand without attempting to improve with further edits.
:The definition needs to reflect the debate to be more inclusive. Otherwise, the entry will misinform and not be neutral. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 23:04, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

::You are wrong in thinking that what you changed was a &quot;definition&quot; of conversion therapy. It was an explanation of what conversion therapy involves, and that's not the same thing. It was sourced. And yes, definitions of conversion therapy do have be based on sources that define conversion therapy, otherwise that's an original research analysis of a source, something which is totally unacceptable, not &quot;valid&quot;. NARTH's not using the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; isn't an excuse for you to use something that does not use the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; to define conversion therapy.

Both sources are clearly relevant. the problem is that, in the context of the debate, those who believe in addressing feelings of unwanted same sex attraction do not want to call the person experiencing the feelings gay or lesbian; to do so (for them) is to beg the question.

I accept that the edit was well-intentioned, but the source being used does not mention bisexuals (or lesbians either, for that matter). I think it's probably simpler for the article to say that conversion therapy tries to change same-sex attracted people, without mentioning all the different groups and sub-groups that this category might possibly cover.
:::::::And to explain things a little more clearly to Hyper3: there's no need for me to show that the no original research policy specifically covers definitions, because it's a general rule that forbids adding content to articles that is not properly backed up by sources, which is what you did.

== Lead ==

The lead currently says:

{{cquote|'''Conversion therapy''', sometimes called '''reparative therapy''', involves methods intended to convert [[bisexual]], [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] people to heterosexuality.}}

I believe that this fails to communicate the sense of reparative therapy that such therapists (herafter RTs) could recognise. Surely this controversial topic should recognise what RTs think they are doing, even if for the sake of neutrality, what others think is reflected also. I have found a relevant quotation that sums up, what RTs think they are doing: &quot;providing psychological care to those who are distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions.&quot; In the literature it is common for RTs to avoid using the terms &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; although they may use the word &quot;homosexual.&quot; This is because they are trying to distinguish sexual activity from sexual identity. Indeed, the language of &quot;conversion&quot; is also missing. However misguided anyone may perceive this, in order to understand the RT, opponents must be generous enough to allow the RT voice to be heard. I would humbly suggest that this offers opponents the chance to refute the RT case more appropriately, as hearing people clearly allows for a rebuttal to be formulated more accurately. In other words, it is in no one's interest to silence opposing voices, indeed the amplification of difference leads to more constructive interaction. Any response? [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 21:50, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

:What reparative therapists may happen to think is irrelevant if their views have not been presented in reliable published sources. So far as I know, there are no reliable sources that provide a definition of conversion therapy from a pro-reparative therapy viewpoint. The quotation you offer is not a definition of conversion or reparative therapy, and should not be presented as one.

== The Lead paragraph ==

According to [[WP:LEAD]]:

{{cquote|The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points—including any notable controversies. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources, and the notability of the article's subject should be established in the first sentence of the lead, if possible.}}

Therefore a description of reparative therapy does not need to be a definition to be included in the Lead section. An appropriate, relevant, and referenced description is all that is required. As the article is about reparative therapy, failing to give a definition that matches with proponent's views (admittedly, in the context of the views of any opposition) would be misleading. Currently, this article needs such a description to achieve [[WP:NPOV]]. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 21:09, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

:I think you have misunderstood the point of the statement you quoted from NARTH (&quot;providing psychological care to those who are distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot;). It does not seem to be meant as either a definition or a description of any specific kind of therapy. Nor is it quite true that the article is about reparative therapy, since that has been defined both as a general term for attempts to convert people away from being gay and as a term for a specific kind of change therapy. Both of those points of view are acknowledged in the article, which as a whole is about reparative therapy only in the former sense.

::If the article is not about reparative therapy, why does the opening line quote it as a synonym? You seem to be suggesting that the article is not about reparative therapy; I would suggest that as the direct successor to conversion therapy, reparative therapy is very much relevant to the article.
::The quote accurately describes the motivation and the goals of reparative therapy, though we cannot know the intentions of the author. The lead is not the place to describe the actual nature of the therapy, though that does need including too, further down. The issue is that there is a clear divergence of opinion as to what reparative therapy is attempting to do, and this needs to be reflected in the article, and specifically in the lead, with a source close to the centre of those who currently offer such therapy. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 00:03, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:::Reparative therapy is used in two different senses: A) as a synonym for conversion therapy in general (as the lead explains) and B) as the name for a particular kind of conversion therapy. The entire article is about reparative therapy in sense A) but only one small section of it (in Theories and Techniques) is about reparative therapy in sense B). The quote from NARTH isn't a description of the motives or the goals of reparative therapy in either sense - it doesn't even use the term &quot;reparative therapy.&quot; [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 00:12, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:::: The quote doesn't need to use the term reparative therapy when it comes in a context that is clearly all about reparative therapy. The quote allows those whose view reflect the reparative therapy environment to speak in their own terms about what they think they are doing. They could not identify with the current version, and therefore the current version is defective. What is being added is a reference to the sense of distress, talking about feelings rather than orientation, and leaving out labels like gay and lesbian. These three things are important for reparative therapy to be adequately represented in this article. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 00:26, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
::::: The context establishes no such thing. NARTH members would probably understand reparative therapy in the narrower sense of a specific kind of conversion therapy, and it's not at at all clear that that is what that document is discussing. The quote explains nothing about what reparative therapy might be or involve, and so is poorly chosen and quite unsuitable for the lead. That NARTH might not like the current version of the lead has nothing, by itself, to do with whether the lead is NPOV or not.

(unindented) An older version has this under the Medical Consensus which I think is much more NPOV, though it doesn't include the most recent results from the task force[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=227104903&amp;oldid=227104206#Mainstream_medical_view_in_the_U.S.]:
:The medical and mental health consensus in the United States is that there is &quot;no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of &quot;reparative&quot; treatments&quot;,[1] but that there is anecdotal evidence for both harm and success.[5][2][6][7] All major U.S. mental health organizations have expressed concerns about such practices. The American Psychological Association states that &quot;it seems likely that the promotion of change therapies reinforces stereotypes and contributes to a negative climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons.&quot;[2]

:The ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy (American Psychological Association) to recommending that ethical practitioners refrain from using conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or referring patients to others who do (American Counseling Association). The organizations do, however, respect the client's right to self-determination. As a result of the medical view, conversion therapy is a largely marginalized practice.[3] Today's conversion therapists characterize the movement as offering the possibility of a choice to people who are unhappy with their attraction to the same sex.[8] [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:14, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
::I do not see any obvious way in which the medical consensus section of that version of the article, which is very old, is superior to what is there now.

== Neutrality ==

{{tl|rfctag|soc}}

The lead needs to describe what conversion/reparative therapists think they are doing. This does not need to exclude any mainstream opinions. An article about a minority viewpoint should clearly state what that minority viewpoint is. Wikipedia articles ought to show neutrality. &amp;mdash;[[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] &lt;small&gt;(via [[User:RFC posting script|posting script]])&lt;/small&gt; 09:14, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:The lead ''should not'' describe what conversion/reparative therapists think they are doing. That is firstly because their views on that are not necessarily different from those of opponents of conversion therapy (though they obviously evaluate it differently) and secondly because, to the extent that their views may differ (something that has not even been demonstrated) theirs would be a fringe view. This is not an article about a fringe view of conversion therapy, it's an article about conversion therapy itself, and it needs to reflect the mainstream view. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 09:18, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:::The edit that I have in mind is this:

:::{{cquote|'''Conversion therapy''', sometimes called '''reparative therapy''', is defined by opponents as methods intended to convert gay and lesbian people to heterosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiner.com/x-4107-Gay--Lesbian-Issues-Examiner~y2009m8d5-APA-report--Gay-conversion-therapy-can-cause-depression-and-suicide-attempts APA: Gay conversion therapy can cause depression and suicide attempts]&lt;/ref&gt; and by adherents, as methods &quot;providing psychological care to those who are distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narth.com/docs/journalsummary.html What Research Shows: NARTH's Response to the APA Claims on Homosexuality(Summary) NARTH website, accessed Aug 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
:::I have found objections to this is far unconvincing (read the previous exchange for further information). I am not stuck on this edit, but feel that something needs to be added to help the reader understand what this is about from several points of view, especially as the article is about a particular minority approach. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 09:28, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

::::: I'm not sure that what they think they are doing is correct - it would be what they say they think they are doing, and reliable sources suggest that what they say they think they are doing is misleading.  The recent APA report says that what they say they think they are doing is not what is happening.  They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.  It is to psychtherapy what 'The Holy Blood the Holy Grail' is to religious history. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 15:08, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
::::::I'm fully aware that the reason that this edit is opposed is that those who oppose it are committed to a different view. And I understand that each person is shaped within the community in which they live, and find it hard to see outside that environment, as I find it hard to see beyond my own thoughts and feelings and the community within which I live. The point here is not that the view is right, it is that it is verifiably sourced and relevant. The article on conversion therapy ought to be able to present what those committed to conversion therapy believe, whilst also presenting other viewpoints. There may be more people committed to sexual reorientation as a theory of sexuality than there are those who self-identify as gay or lesbian; neither positions can be called &quot;fringe.&quot; I do not think that wikipedia is the place for censorship; it isn't even the place to discuss the relevant merits of the case; it is an encyclopaedia that categorises knowledge for the benefit of all. Some will use it to inform themselves better on what they believe; some will use it to inform themselves about what their opponents believe. It is about information not point of view. A neutral point of view will allow all views to be aired that are not fringe and with due weight. I am arguing for wikipedia policy, (which seems very fair to all in cases like this) not for a particular perspective. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 15:51, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::::: There is nothing censored - both NARTH and Nicolosi have their own articles, and they are covered within the text of the article.  In the lead, it is a question of weight.  If the lead was full of LGBT views on this, you might have a point, but it hasn't.  It has the position statements of organisations of the two APAs and other such professional associations.  These are neutral views in their own right, and they are the professional position on this.  There is no alternative view to this other than partisan views.  Putting in partisan views creates its own problems, especially in the lead, because then those would need to be counterbalanced by other partisan views - groups like [[Stonewall (UK)]] or [[Pink Therapy]].  What you have at the moment is professional positions based on findings, not opinion, &lt;s&gt;opinion&lt;/s&gt; position which clearly states that there is no evidential basis for certain opinions that people's sexual orientation can be changed. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 18:45, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:::::::::MishMich - [1] the subject is reparative therapy; you are suggesting that to use the words of a reparative therapist to describe what they think reparative therapy is, involves giving undue weight. Think about it for a moment. Fair enough, if the article was different, say homosexuality or other LGBT focussed entries, you might have something, but the topic is reparative therapy. 
:::::::::[2]You suggest that the lead isn't full of LGBT views, when in fact it makes a statement that is consonant with LGBT views, and misses out the idea that feelings of same sex attraction may be unwanted, and according to some, be susceptible to therapy. I understand why you might want to say that, but this is the whole point of the article...
:::::::::[3] All views are partisan if we conceive of views as products of their communities. Traditions of inquiry grow up around questions and problems, display explanatory power or not, grow and or die, extend themselves or contract. The question of same sex attraction is one that is answered in separate ways by different traditions; from a psychological/scientific standpoint by people like the APA, and from a psycho-spiritual standpoint by a number of different religious traditions. Their validity and rationality is dependant on the tradition in which they are found. The much younger tradition, which you are saying is neutral, stands in the context of a much older and still very extensive tradition, which disagrees with it. I don't believe you can call it neutral, though it may be valid and rational within its own context. The encyclopaedia project should gather this knowledge and present it well, not choose one version in the guise of neutrality.
:::::::::[4]Reparative therapy in the sense of it being the latest version of a long and tortured history of religious attempts to deal with the problem (often very badly in my opinion, but lets let that pass for now) is the subject of much of the article. Nicolosi is the best example of current proponents, and stands for the tradition of enquiry that a good proportion of the article documents (although he would no agree with a great deal of the material). It is therefore due a certain amount of weight, as are any others who wish to comment. I would not object to other LGBT views being represented in the lead. Actually its partisan views masquerading as neutral that is much harder to deal with. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 19:44, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:: Sure, but conversion therapy falls under psychiatry/psychology, and this is about that, not religious views on homosexuality - that is a different article and well dealt with already. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 20:10, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
::: Conversion therapy deals with a specific type of therapy, which goal is to change sexual orientation.  NARTH deals with &quot;providing psychological care to those who are distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot;, which includes, but is not limited to attempts to change sexual orientation. Therefore, not everything that NARTH does can be construed as conversion therapy.  I think it would be completely appropriate to talk about therapies related to conversion therapy, but don't specifically try to change the sexual orientation.  I also think it is important to realize that regardless of what NARTH might advocate, they still have to follow the same guidelines as everyone else.  I don't understand why it is considered a fringe group, if they are following APA guidelines. True, simply having a member publish in the APA is not evidence that NARTH is not a fringe group, but what evidence do you have that NARTH is a fringe group?

Hyper3, you say &quot;I'm fully aware that the reason that this edit is opposed is that those who oppose it are committed to a different view.&quot; Please see the policy on assuming good faith - [[WP:AGF]], which you are failing to observe here. The reason why I oppose your edit is because it is original research. The sources you provided do not back up the statements you want to add to the lead. Even if NARTH were a reliable source and even if it were giving a definition of conversion or reparative therapy (and neither of those things is true) it would still reflect only NARTH's view, not those of all supporters of conversion therapy.

:::: Hi JJ, Hyper needs to brief you properly when lobbying your support in backing him up here.  The only aspect of NARTH that is relevant is its role in promoting a form of therapy that all professional psych associations have made extensive and clear statements regarding its inappropriateness.  That is covered in the article.  If it has now changed its tune, so it does some other kind of therapy, then that is not relevant to the lead, although it might be relevant to the main text, in passing, provided you have a reliable source to show that it has changed its approach (in a way that is neither [[WP:SYNTH]] nor [[WP:OR]].  &quot;providing psychological care to those who are distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot; is not the same as &quot;conversion therapy&quot; - of it were, according to the APA, they would be risking challenges of professional misconduct, and they do not say that, do they?

== Consensus ==

I am both surprised and disappointed that there has been no proper discussion here since the article was protected. My proposal is that the article should be reverted back to the version of 08:10, 8 August 2009. The changes made by Destinero to the lead here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=306768307&amp;oldid=306758511] were not necessary or an improvement, and the revert by Whatever404 that followed undid much helpful editing, including not only the correction of a major factual error in the lead by Destinero but an important template fix by Guy M [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=306723443&amp;oldid=306680964]. If nobody can be bothered discussing on the talk page, then I am simply going to assume that nobody objects to my proposal, and will go ahead and do the revert when protection expires.

:I would like the most recent findings from the APA to be included on this page - including that psychotherapy, support groups and life events can change sexual orientation identity, that there is no evidence whether or not recent efforts to change sexual orientation are effective, there is no harm in rejecting a gay identity, therapists need to be aware of person's religious identity, and that the religious identity might be stronger than other identities, and that ex-gay groups are beneficial.  I am more concerned with other articles right now, and I completely concur that the findings did not validate conversion therapy, but instead offered an alternative approach to dealing with ego-dystonic homosexuality.  I am more interested in resolving the debate on the ego-dystonic sexual orientation page and the homosexuality and psychology page before trying to apply the changes here, since there are still many aspects of conversion therapy that I cannot defend.

:: The evidence shows that trying to change sexual orientation is ineffective.  Nothing in the article is in error as it stands, because the APA confirmed everything in their 1997 statement in the 2009 statement.  All that is needed is to see what they have said that supplements the 1997 statement, and insert it, and update citations as relevant.  There is no urgency in that, and the proposed changes should be worked on here first, by developing a draft for insertion, which once agreed upon can then be inserted. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:42, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
:::No.  The new APA statement says &quot;There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation.&quot;  That is COMPLETELY different from saying that evidence shows it is ineffective.  According to the APA report, evidence doesn't show one way or the other. It does say conversion therapy is ineffective, and I am fine saying conversion therapy is ineffective, but to extend that to other methods is inaccurate.

::::The disagreement here does not seem to be over whether the new APA report is important or if its findings should be included; there seems to be agreement that it is and that they should be. Rather, it's about how the article should be updated. If Joshuajohanson feels that the report supports the various claims he made (eg, that &quot;psychotherapy, support groups and life events can change sexual orientation identity&quot;, and so on), then it is up to him to justify those claims by citing the relevant parts of the report. Then he can propose a way of revising the article on the talk page, and it can be changed if there is a consensus. As Mish said, this process does not have to be rushed. It should be done in a careful way, with time for proper discussion of the proposed changes. The results of changing the article without discussion have been less than satisfactory; the additions made to the lead were unnecessary and those to the American medical consensus section only confused matters.

:::::I do feel the report supports the claim that &quot;psychotherapy, support groups and life events can change sexual orientation identity&quot;.  I got that from &quot;sexual orientation identity, not sexual orientation, appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, or life events&quot; on page 86 and from &quot;Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., group membership and affiliation), behavior, and values (Nicolosi et al., 2000).&quot; on page 120. 
::::I am not sure if Joshuajohanson is saying that conversion therapy and SOCE are two different things or not.

[[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 20:18, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::The APA defines conversion therapy to be psychotherapy which is based off the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder, whereas SOCE involves any effort to change sexual orientation, including, but not limited to conversion therapy, and regardless of the reasoning behind it.  SOCE can include ex-gay groups, religious organizations and other non-professional methods. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 20:35, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::: The APA says that there are no studies that show whether recent SOCE work or not - because of the poor quality of research - fine, but that has to be understood on the back of all the good quality research that demonstrated that changing sexual orientation did not work.  In other words, there is no evidence to show that it works (this was established prior to 1997, and that has not been superceded), and there is no evidence that anything that has developed since works or not.  That means there is still no evidence that sexual orientation can be changed, and the only evidence there is is that it cannot be changed. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 21:37, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::::Right.  I think that should be explained here.  Maybe this summary would work - &quot;Older methods were ineffective at changing sexual orientation and there is not enough evidence to conclude whether or not current methods change sexual orientation.  However, sexual orientation identity can be changed through psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.&quot;  I think what is most important are the current methods.  It's not like anyone is going to go back to the 1990's to try to get that brand of conversion therapy.  A lot has happened since then, and the newer stuff needs to be reflected here.

I am still considering this issue and will have more to say later. For now, I'll simply note that Joshuajohanson is wrong about the report identifying conversion therapy as one type of SOCE. The main body of the report does not use the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; (it's present only in the references) or say anything specific about how conversion therapy does or does not differ from SOCE. This might seem to be a pedantic point, but we have to keep it in mind if we want to avoid any original research analysis of this source. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 06:27, 12 August 2009 (UTC)
:I'm still waiting to see if anyone has a reason why we can't include this information.

== Cutting back history ==

I have removed large parts of the history section (most of which I added in the first place), in most cases because there are no sources stating that the material in them relates to conversion therapy, which makes it original research, and in some cases because the material is relevant but undue. I have shifted some of that material to a more appropriate article, and added a link to it here. I have proposed changes similar to this on the talk page and on my project page, and no one has objected, so I have now finally made some of my proposed changes, which have been overdue for months. The current arrangement of the sections is provisional and will require further changes, and no doubt more material will have to be carefully cut back. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 19:24, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

== American medical consensus ==

Joshuajohanson, without waiting for a proper discussion on the talk page, has made a series of destructive and unhelpful changes to this crucial section of the article. I have accordingly reverted them. I'm sorry, but changes like this, which can easily look like POV pushing to make the article portray conversion therapy in a positive way, even if that is not how you intend them, need to be more extensively discussed than they have been so far here. One other editor expressing agreement with you, without explaining his or her grounds for the agreement in any way, is not good enough. There are many other editors who are interested in this article, and you should wait to give them the opportunity to express their views on this. If necessary, place a request for comment, so that a proper consensus can be developed here, not just a temporary agreement of two editors. I repeat my suggestion to Knulclunk to explain ''why'' he or she agrees with Joshuajohanson. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:05, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

So that we can be absolutely clear what is under discussion here, the version of that section edited by Joshuajohanson looks like this:

'''American medical consensus'''

The medical and scientific consensus in the United States is that conversion therapy is potentially harmful, but that there is no scientifically adequate research demonstrating either its effectiveness or harmfulness&lt;ref name=&quot;answers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PsychNews&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=H. |first=K |title=APA Maintains Reparative Therapy Not Effective |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/99-01-15/therapy.html |publisher=Psychiatric News (news division of the American Psychiatric Association) |date=[[1999-01-15]] |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether recent methods &quot;do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation.&quot;  Older methods have been found to be ineffective at changing sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;newAPA&quot;&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mainstream medical bodies state that conversion therapy can be harmful because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytconversion&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Luo |first=Michael |title=Some Tormented by Homosexuality Look to a Controversial Therapy |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/nyregion/12group.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |publisher=''The New York Times'' |page=1 |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not sufficient evidence to determine the benefit or harm of such therapies&lt;ref name=apa /&gt;, and there is extensive debate on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;  The reports of harm and cure counterbalance each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001a.aspx Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;  One report indicates that participants are at increased risk for guilt, depression, anxiety, confusion, self-blame, suicidal gestures, unprotected anal intercourse with untested partners, and heavy substance abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShidloandSchroeder&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shidlo|Schroeder|2002|pp=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report indicated that most of the participants found that the therapy was helpful to them, psychologically, spiritually, and sexually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/18481660/Clients_perceptions_of_how_reorientation_therapy_and_self-help_can_promote_changes_in_sexual_orientation ]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a broad concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy itself causes social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of gay and bisexual people to lead happy, healthy lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;apa&quot; /&gt;
== Further help ==

Whereas initially, my edit was considered fringe, original research, and not backed up by sources, conversations since then have failed to establish that this is the case. I think an unbiased outsider would understand the clear case that conversion/reparative therapy is not being described in a way that sensitively portrays the approach that the many caring and patient-centred therapists who employ this therapy could recognise. I believe that this may be because of the ''a priori'' standpoints of other editors in this matter, and we should ask for outside help. The new objections that are emerging, centred around whether the article really is about what it says it is, I am not finding convincing either. I think we should get other opinions involved. They may be able to help .[[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 08:58, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:Accusing other editors of bias is not a helpful way forward. What we personally think about this subject is not, or should not, be the issue. Personally, I'm against it. However, I also consider myself to be a reasonably neutral editor, and I try to base things on reliable sources and not on my personal views. Sometimes that takes an effort, and I find it becomes easier as time passes. I can understand your frustration that other editors may not agree with you, but please be willing to consider that they are disagreeing in good faith, based on concerns for [[WP:NPOV]], and not out of some desire to push personal views.

Please say why this is not a reliable source. (And thanks for helping me work this through).  [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 07:59, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

:Firstly, it's not a reliable source because NARTH is a fringe group. Reliable sources represent the mainstream views about topics, not fringe views. Secondly, even if were a reliable source, it wouldn't be relevant because it is not concerned with trying to define conversion therapy.

:: [[WP:FRINGE]] does not support your standpoint, where, for example [[Creation Science]] is not considered fringe. It is worth bearing in mind that the article is about a theory which NARTH and Nicolosi are significant proponents. Therefore I do not think that this quotation could be excluded under the terms of [[WP:FRINGE]]. It would be like ignoring major proponents of Creation Science in the Creation Science article. Indeed [[Joseph Nicolosi]] coined the term reparative therapy, and has his own wikipedia page.On this page, something like my proposed sentence currently exists without controversy.

:::[[WP:FRINGE]] does not say that Creation Science is not fringe, and it would be irrelevant if it did, as the issue here is NARTH, which holds views (eg, that homosexuality is a mental disorder) that are clearly outside the scientific mainstream. In any case, the quotation is not a definition of conversion therapy, and should not be presented as one. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 21:36, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
::::In fact, [[WP:FRINGE]] does refer to [[creation science]].
::::{{cquote|Parity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia. For example, the lack of peer-reviewed criticism of [[creation science]] should not be used as a justification for marginalizing or removing scientific criticism of creation science, since creation science itself is almost never published in peer-reviewed journals.  Likewise, the views of adherents should not be excluded from an article on creation science because their works lack peer review.  Fringe views may be excluded from articles on mainstream subjects to the extent that they are [[WP:WEIGHT|rarely if ever included]] by reliable sources on those subjects.}}
::::The way [[WP:FRINGE]] operates should not exclude a minority view like those of NARTH. In fact, an article whose subject matter is the examination of a minority view, is the very place that such views should be discussed, and [[WP:FRINGE]] is clear about that. The inclusion of the views of adherents to minority views should not be excluded.
::::I would argue that the common acceptance of views like NARTH amongst the global Pentecostal Evangelical and Charismatic community (making up as much as 10% of the world's population) means that this is far from a fringe view, although it may not be accurate. The scientific research done by NARTH members is commonly referred to (albeit often disparagingly) by the dominant scientific community when engaging with the subject of reparative therapy. There's no real way to avoid this, and the article needs to admit such sources, because the standard is not truth, but verifiability.

It does not officially believe that homosexuality is a treatable mental disorder, as you claim.  The position statement says it believes that it has biological influences.

== [[Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Arbitration cases]] ==

The arbitration cases on fringe theories are very relevant; at one point it says:

{{cquote|1a) [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], a fundamental policy, requires fair representation of significant alternatives to scientific orthodoxy. Significant alternatives, in this case, refers to legitimate scientific disagreement, as opposed to pseudoscience.}}

I believe that the views being quoted by Joshuajohanson, are just this: significant alternatives, and are not pseudoscience, as studies can be found in appropriate journals.  [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 21:27, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

Born Gay, this has numerous problems.
1] &quot;outside the scientific community&quot; - you know there are people within the scientific community who agree with this.
2] you characterise the testimony of those who claim to have been helped as suspect without source.
3] weasel words - who are you saying has suspect ethics? Please source
4] Several have been disgraced - whilst this is true you do not source
5] you use one example, cherry-picked from many, and therefore this is [[WP:UNDUE]].

Nothing in that section is a direct quotation. It is a brief summary of an article in the source used, John Gonsiorek and James Weinrich's ''Homosexuality: Research Implications for Public Policy''. The material there is not undue, is not synthesis, and is properly sourced. The concept of weasel words does not apply to material based directly and closely on a reliable source. There is no need to attribute the statements to the source in this case, as I believe it represents the mainstream view of the issue in reliable sources. The article can say as fact that ex-gay ministries are of questionable ethics and professionalism since, so far as I know, there is no dispute about that in reliable sources.

:::: I have reverted the removal of the material about es-gay leaders having sex with clients - but have tagged it as dubious and in need of specificity. 'More than one' is not the same as 'some', and as the lack of clarity is from the source, the claim needs to be clearly stated as being the view of the source, not us.  In fact the whole section needs to be more explicit that this is the view of the source, as the way it reads now it comes across as our view.  I am not sure that this rhetorical device is necessary.  If one or two therapists do something, what does that say about about the movement generally - why is it relevant?  Because there is already a main article on [[Ex-Gay]] linked at the head of the section, all this section should be is a brief summary of that article. At the moment there is a war of attrition on this article, with a group of editors making multiple edits throughout the article.

::::: The material itself is not dubious; the source used clearly supports this statement. I don't think that there is a need to qualify this as the view of the source, because there are no reliable sources stating that it has not happened. In fact, since reliable sources do not contradict what is there, there should be no need to qualify anything as the view of the source used. Such incidents show something important about the ex-gay movements failings, and I do not think that this information should be removed. It would be a mistake to conclude that the ex-gay section in this article should be a brief summary of that article, as here we are discussing the ex-gay movement ''as a form of conversion therapy'' - which is not necessarily the purpose of the main article. I was careful not to add too much information about ex-gay scandals, because that would have repeated too much information already in the main ex-gay article.

That sexual exploitation may also happen to occur in other kinds of psychotherapy is an irrelevant objection to including this content.

== Pseudo science ==

Although I personally agree that conversion therapy is pseudoscience, I have nevertheless reverted the addition of this category to the article. The category page states that, &quot;This category comprises highly notable topics that are generally considered pseudoscientific by the scientific community (such as astrology) and topics that, while perhaps notable, have very few followers and are obviously pseudoscientific (such as the modern belief in a flat Earth).&quot; Conversion therapy is widely criticised within the scientific community, but so far no one has provided sources to show that they generally regard it as pseudoscientific. In fact, I'm aware of only a single article, by Douglas Haldeman, that calls it a pseudoscience. The various statements about conversion therapy by professional bodies in the United States do not use the term &quot;pseudoscience&quot;, and we cannot attribute such a view to them unless they specifically use that term, as it would be original research. Mentioning that conversion therapy has been called pseudoscience would be helpful, but the category should not be added without more evidence to support it.

It concerns psychologists Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse, who in their study of ex-gay movements are absolutely explicit (on page 374) about the fact that they ''do not'' consider ex-gay treatments of homosexuality to be a form of conversion therapy and that they regard their study of ex-gay treatment as having no direct relevance to conversion therapy. This material is extremely misleading and must be removed (and note that despite the edit summary used, the addition was not discussed on the talk page first).

:This brings us to the point of the entire article structure. Some time ago the article was rewritten to absorb what is often called &quot;reparative therapy&quot; under the umbrella of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, basically treating the the two concepts as synonyms.

And no, the article does not say that reparative therapy and conversion therapy are the same thing - it says they sometimes are used to refer to the same thing, and sometimes they are used differently.

* 1. it is supported by many conservative Christian political and social lobbying groups and by the ex-gay movement,[3][4]
is followed by this quote from NARTH:
* 2. who believe that &quot;providing psychological care to those distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot; is appropriate. [5]
This is a problem, because the next quote about NARTH is:
* 3. The main organization advocating secular forms of conversion therapy is the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH).[7][8]

Here is the problem.  2 relates to 1, but 3 states that 2 is not the same as 1.  The quote from NARTH is its position, not the position of &quot;conservative Christian political and social lobbying groups&quot; and/or &quot;the ex-gay movement&quot; - because NARTH is a not a representative of these groups.  Using a different citation from NARTH which quotes the chair of the APA (and which is not included in the more recent 2009 position) only applies to psychotherapeutic responses, not Christian and ex-gay groups support for conversion therapy.

:The sentence &quot;Despite this it is supported by many conservative Christian political and social lobbying groups and by the ex-gay movement,[3][4] who believe that &quot;providing psychological care to those distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot; is appropriate&quot; does not seem appropriate to me. It looks like [[WP:SYNTH]], in fact, since the quotation is from NARTH and describes only their view of what they are doing; there is no evidence that it is also the view of the conservative Christian political and social lobbying groups and the ex-gay movement. If someone wanted to add statements about what they think or support, they would have to come from them, not NARTH, but adding them would make the lead too long and complicated. In my view the lead was satisfactory before all these changes, and would suggest just reverting it back. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:32, 7 September 2009 (UTC)
== Discussion on American medical consensus ==

I am going to state my objections to this at length on the talk page - working out the details of this section requires a proper discussion on the talk page between responsible editors, not more cavalier editing on the article. My first comment on it is simply that it's a confusing and unappetizing mess. Maybe Joshuajohanson is simply trying to be fair to both sides, but if so the result of his attempt is a disaster. The various statements that make up that section are not harmonized with each other in any comprehensible way. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:13, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

: Yes, I agree, it appears written in a complex way that seeks to present as 'neutral' a point that is made by cherry-picking through the latest position, but fails to convey the substance of the report, which is actually quite straightforward.  There is no evidence that SOCE works, and the best evidence is that SOCE doesn't work, there is as much evidence for it as causing harm as helping, and therapists should not be promoting therapies that claim SOCE works.  If we need to include what is said about other approaches which seek to change sexual orientation identity in this article, that needs discussion as well. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 07:12, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

::The basic problem I see with that section, in the version that Joshuajohanson has edited it into, is that it does not really describe a &quot;consensus.&quot; A consensus would be a group of positions that all the mainstream groups can agree upon, not a collection of, &quot;on the one hand this, on the other hand that&quot; sort of statements. If the consensus section does not present a consistent view on the issue, then it's no longer a consensus section but a debate section with a very misleading name. In addition, I think the writing is dubious. A statement like, &quot;The reports of harm and cure counterbalance each other&quot; could be read in different ways and is dangerously ambiguous. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:26, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

::Reference 11 in the section above is a study by NARTH supporters A. Dean Byrd, Joseph Nicolosi, and Richard W. Potts. I believe this is the same study that Destinero removed from the article a while ago. One may make the argument that the study should be mentioned somewhere in the article, but it certainly shouldn't be part of American medical consensus. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:38, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

::: Certainly not part of any consensus, because this study is addressed in the recent APA report, and the reasons for excluding it were detailed. It is a view that runs contrary to consensus.  The consensus is that it harms, the position that runs counter to consensus is that it may be helpful rather than harmful. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:00, 4 September 2009 (UTC)
::::The consensus is that there is no evidence for harm, but there is potential for harm. There is no evidence for benefit, and the two counterbalance each other.

::::: No, that is what the report found - the consensus is not the same thing as a systematic review.  The consensus is what the various policy statements say.  There is consensus, and the advocates of this type of therapy are outside it - that is why all major professional bodies do not support any therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation.  That is the consensus.  They don't support it because there is no evidence that it works, and because the best available (earlier) evidence is that it harms.  There is no reason to go into more detail, as I have tried to explain before.  Consensus can, and has, been reached on this basis, because it is not down to those who form the consensus to prove or disprove anything - it is up to the advocates, who have failed to do so.

::::: I reverted the NPOV tag on this section, for the reasons discussed above, as well as detailed on the reverting edit - but, there is another reason why this tag is not appropriate, the entire article is already tagged as NPOV, so this sort of over-tagging in that light could be seen as vandalism.  Either tag the section(s) that need attention, or the whole article if it needs attention throughout - but there is little point tagging both the article and section (if the article needs attention, it adds nothing to point out one particular section).

:::::::Mish, that isn't just the most recent study. The 2001 study, which specifically addressed conversion therapy said &quot;To date, there are no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of &quot;reparative&quot; treatments.&quot;  Just like there is nothing to determine the efficacy, there is nothing to determine the harm. Why is Nicolosi not representative of a consensus, but Shidlo &amp; Schroeder 2002 are?  I would point out that the ACA referenced Nicolosi's study when passing their resolution.[http://www.counseling.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases.aspx?AGuid=b68aba97-2f08-40c2-a400-0630765f72f4] See ref 4. The ACA resolution states &quot;if clients still decide that they wish to seek conversion therapy as a form of treatment, counselors should also help clients understand what types of information they should seek from any practitioner who does engage in conversion therapy.&quot;  Why isn't self-determination mentioned in this?

:::::::: You ask why he is not part of the consensus.  The answer is in the recent policy document.  The consensus of professional and psychiatric and psychological associations are that therapies like he promotes have no sound basis.  Obviously, he is not part of that consensus.  Him and three or four other people in the profession in the USA.  That is OK, but it does not make his view part of the consensus.  His view runs contrary to the consensus, and it would not be appropriate to include somebody whose views runs contrary to the consensus in a section that is called 'the consensus...', would it?  His view would have to be in a section about views outside the consensus (although if these are fringe views, they may not warrant inclusion at all - but that is a different discussion).  His views might hold a certain consensus amongst some religious groups, but that does not make them part of the mainstream psychological consensus, especially when the association representing that consensus has spelled out the problems with any approach that seeks to change sexual orientation. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 21:36, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

It seems that there is no agreement at the moment on this part of the article. Perhaps it needs to be changed in important ways, but, simply to state the obvious, we need to discuss whether or how to do that before making major changes. Discussion is the way to resolve things. Also, I agree with Mish that tagging both the article as a whole and one section of it in particular is excessive, unnecessary, and may potentially even be seen as vandalism.

:::How come Shidlo &amp; Schroeder's findings that &quot;Participants are at increased risk for guilt, depression, anxiety, confusion, self-blame, suicidal gestures, unprotected anal intercourse with untested partners, and heavy substance abuse&quot; gets a part in the consensus section then? My main beef is that accounts of harm are not being counterbalanced with accounts of cure, like the source says. We either need the Nicolosi survey to balance the Shidlo paper, or talk about the cures found in the Shidlo paper, or remove the Shidlo paper altogether, but to reference only the most negative part of the more negative paper is not NPOV.

Can I suggest you do this - go through each change, one by one, to give other editors time to respond - rather than chucking everything in the pot all at once.  Nicolosi is not part of the section on the medical consensus because NARTH is not part of the medical consensus.  How many ways does this need saying before this makes sense?  The medical consensus specifically addresses Nicolosi.  If you feel it is unfair, then take it up with the APA. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 22:34, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

== recent series of edits ==

I have reverted the recent edits, because the way to approach contested material is not to insert it and then seek discussion.  With [[WP:BOLD]], once the insertion is made, if it is then contested, the way to deal with this is negotiation through to consensus - not persistent re-insertion.  The onus is on the inserting editor to convince other editors that the insertion is justified.  What I say here cannot be [[WP:SYNTH]], because this is a discussion.  What is inserted in the article can be [[WP:SYNTH]], and this recent insertion does appear to be so.  The evidence is not the consensus, the consensus is arrived at based upon the evidence - the evidence is not the consensus.[[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:48, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

The consensus is what is contained in the statement below (references edited out for brevity, except the sole reference to Nicolosi in a way that shows his views are not accommodated within the consensus:

* WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association expressly opposes prejudice (defined broadly) and discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status
* WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association takes a leadership role in opposing prejudice and discrimination, including prejudice based on or derived from religion or spirituality, and encourages commensurate
consideration of religion and spirituality as diversity variables;
* WHEREAS, Psychologists respect human diversity including age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status and psychologists strive to prevent bias from their own spiritual, religious, or non-religious beliefs from taking precedence over professional practice and standards or scientific findings in their work as psychologists;
* WHEREAS, Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that it is outside the role and expertise of psychologists, as psychologists, to adjudicate religious or spiritual tenets, while also recognizing that psychologists
can appropriately speak to the psychological implications of religious/spiritual beliefs or practices when relevant psychological findings about those implications exist;
* WHEREAS, Those operating from religious/spiritual traditions are encouraged to recognize that it is outside their role and expertise to adjudicate empirical scientific issues in psychology, whilealso recognizing they can appropriately speak to theological implications of psychological science;
* WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association encourages collaborative activities in pursuit of shared prosocial goals between psychologists and religious communities when such collaboration can be done in a mutually respectful manner that is consistent with psychologists’ professional and scientific roles;
* WHEREAS, Societal ignorance and prejudice about a same-sex sexual orientation places some sexual minorities at risk for seeking sexual orientation change due to personal, family, or religious conflicts, or lack of information;
* WHEREAS, Some mental health professionals advocate treatments based on the premise that homosexuality is a mental disorder (e.g., Nicolosi, 1991);
* WHEREAS, Sexual minority children and youth are especially vulnerable populations with unique developmental tasks who lack adequate legal protection from involuntary or coercive treatment and whose
parents and guardians need accurate information to make informed decisions regarding their development and well-being; and
* WHEREAS, Research has shown that family rejection is a predictor of negative outcomes and that parental acceptance and school support are protective factors for sexual minority youth;
* THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation; 
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that the emerging knowledge on affirmative multiculturally competent treatment provides a foundation for an appropriate evidence-based practice with children, adolescents and adults who are distressed by or seek to change their sexual orientation;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation, in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people’s rights and dignity;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages practitioners to be aware that age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, disability, language, and socioeconomic status may interact with sexual stigma, and contribute to variations in sexual orientation identity development, expression, and experience;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions;
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association supports the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias that is based in lack of knowledge about sexual orientation; and
* BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages advocacy groups, elected officials, mental health professionals, policy makers, religious professionals and organizations, and other organizations to seek areas of collaboration that may promote the wellbeing of sexual minorities.

The statement is quite clear that there is no evidence of benefits, and that is not [[WP:SYNTH]], and there is no mention of reports of harm or benefit, and so insertion of that as being part of any consensus is itself [[WP:SYNTH]].  neither is there mention of changes to 'sexual orientation identity'.

:: I didn't contest it, somebody else did - and you re-inserted despite there being an ongoing discussion about it.  When material is inserted within a series of edits, it is best to revert them so that the whole series can be proposed here and discussed one by one.  I have yet to see this happen.  The onus is on the one inserting to justify their edits, and as yet I have not seen any attempt to do that.   You have been invited to discuss these edits, yet have gone on and resumed the serial insertions and reversions.  Now, I am not going to revert your reversion, but I must warn you that if you persist in working this way you will find yourself reported for edit warring.  I am going to suggest that you revert this material yourself, as a sign of good faith, and participate in discussion instead - and if you do not, it will work against you should this come to lodging a notice about you.  Working this way will not improve the article.  To be clear, what you inserted is not included in the above, so is not part of the APA consensus, nor any other position statment.  You are welcome to discuss whether it is appropriate elsewhere, but Nicolosi and the discussion about benefits of conversion therapy does not belong in the section on consensus, because the consensus is that there is no evidence for any benefit - and the consensus specifically singles out Nicolosi's approach for comment.  You may not like that - but that is what it says. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:04, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

:::The article should remain as it was before the latest war errupted if there is no agreement for the changes made by Joshuajohanson (Joshuajohanson may be right that the consensus section has various problems, but even if he is, his proposed solutions to them, such as including Nicolosi in the consensus, are only making matters worse). In any event, the article will be protected from editing again quite quickly, I think, if the edit warring does not stop.

::::This would be the point were one of the contesting editors, Mish and Born Gay, would take Joshuajohanson's concerns and constructively work with him in getting them into the article. '''Mish''': All your very verbose APA statement says is that the APA is opposed to prejudice and is concerned about furthering prejudice through therapy. Since this is already in the article, why did you have to spend 2 pages restating it? '''Joshuajohanson''': We cannot claim there is significant debate about conversion therapy unless there are mainstream sources (like the NYTimes) that says there are. Please work to improve that or let it go. '''Born Gay''': All this &quot;mainstream medical research&quot; crap is taken from a couple of press releases from the last 10 years (see [[WP:RECENT]]) by the admittedly liberal APA because of pressure from GLADD, NGLTF and others. The APA is important and should be quoted here, of course, but the fact that it is being held up as the STANDARD OF TRUTH and NO OTHER OPINIONS OR FACTS SHALL GET PAST is becoming a little frustrating. Obviously many people find counseling and spiritual counseling helpful with unwanted sexual desires.

A small number of his suggestions may have merit (the Nicolosi et al study should perhaps be mentioned in the Studies of Conversion therapy section, for instance), but most of them are harmful, some of them extremely harmful, such as his changes to the consensus section. Telling me to take his concerns seriously is useless if you can't or won't consider what I have said in response to him. Don't use scatology in your comments to me, because I don't appreciate it, and might even be tempted to say something nasty in response. Your complaints about how the APA is &quot;liberal&quot; and acting under pressure from GLAAD are irrelevant and show a failure to understand [[WP:NPOV]].

::::::: Knulclunk. I stated the APA position in full as that is the consensus statement, and what he is seeking to add to the consensus is not there.  That he does not accept this means the only way of showing that is to include it in full.  If you don't think much of the APA, that is fine, but that is not NPOV.  The APA is &quot;The American Psychological Association&quot;, not &quot;An American Psychological Association&quot;, it is the professional association, and this is very significant.  Whether they are liberal or lobbied by GLADD is irrelevant - the were lobbied by lots of people, ex-gay groups included, and they determined a particular response which outlined what members should or should not be doing, and why.  One thing they clearly state is that psychotherpists should not be claiming they can change people's sexual orientation, because there is no evidence that this is the case, and it could be harmful.  You, Hyper and JJ might not like this, but this is what they said, and trying to present what they said as if they said something else runs completely contrary to what this encyclopedia is about.  I also agree that the minority view needs to be addressed - but the whole point of the APA policy is to address that, and it only makes sense in relation to that.  The way it needs to be dealt with is not as part of the consensus, as the consensus is not the minority view, but the majority view which sees the minority view as invalid, and present it for what it is, a minority view that very few professionals support.

It has becoming increasingly disgusting to me to watch the squabbling (which granted, I've participated in) over the American medical consensus section. That section is going to go on being contested, with edits modifying it back and forth without a stable solution, until it's re-organized in some sensible way. An especially awful example of bad content there is the statement, added by Joshuajohanson, that, &quot;The evidence of cures of harm counterbalance each other.&quot; That piece of nonsense, which seems to imply that the idea that conversion therapy can cure homosexuality and the idea that it can't are equally valid, is apparently meant to be based upon the American Psychiatric Association's statement that, &quot;Furthermore, anecdotal reports of &quot;cures&quot; are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm.&quot; Note the key word &quot;anecdotal.&quot; The APA is being careful to refer to &quot;anecdotal&quot; reports so that no one gets the idea that it's real, scientifically valid evidence we're talking about - yet that wrong impression is exactly the one Joshuajohanson's wording leaves the reader with. The solution to this is not to have a direct quotation, which simply looks silly, but to reorganize &quot;Medical, scientific and legal views&quot; so that there are separate sections for the views of the American Psychiatric Association, and the other organizations. We don't need to attribute everything the American Psychiatric Association or any other one group says to the &quot;consensus.&quot; Let the views of each organiztion be described separately in their own sections, with an appropriate summary for each that avoids the type of misleading rubbish that's there now.

:I can't read your mind, Born Gay, though I am learning.  I brought this up several times on the talk page and you said nothing. I thought it was clear that it only applied to anecdotal evidence, since there is no scientifically adequate research demonstrating harmfulness.  I am trying to add that material in a way that is non-contentious. I have changed the edit to hopefully reflect that the evidence is indeed anecdotal.  Hopefully that will suffice until we can reach some consensus on how to reorganize the consensus section.

::It should not be there at all. Not in the form of a direct quotation, not in the form of a misleading and distorted summary, and not even in the form of an accurate summary. It is a statement by a particular organization that represents the view of that organization, and there is not sufficient justification for including it in a &quot;consensus&quot; section unless it can be shown that all the other organizations have exactly the same position. The fact that the ethics guidelines of the various organizations are dealt with separately shows that there are differences of nuance between them, even though they share many positions in common. The different positions of individual organizations on other matters should likewise be dealt with in separate sections for each organization, and the &quot;consensus&quot; material should be strictly limited to statements that it can be demonstrated that all organizations fully agree upon. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:24, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
:::If that is the approach you want to take, then that is fine.  It will take some work to describe the views of each organization in their own section.  When that is finished, then I will be more than happy to move that quote into there, but not until then.  Using that requirement, much of the third paragraph should also be moved into another section. At least it came from a medical organization rather than individual authors.

== Aesthetic Realism ==

BornGay:  I added Aesthetic Realism.  You removed it saying it was unsourced.  I added it back, heavily sourcing it.  You removed it again, demanding that I prove it was part of the history of conversion therapy in the U.S. (ignoring the fact that that evidence was provided in the text you removed).  Aesthetic Realism exactly fits the definition of conversion therapy, defined in the opening sentence of the article as, &quot;Conversion therapy, sometimes called reparative therapy, involves methods intended to convert bisexual, lesbian and gay people to heterosexuality[1].&quot;  They published two books and one film on the subject, gave TV interviews, and purchased huge ads in the largest newspapers in the country to tout their &quot;fix&quot; for homosexuality.  Moreover, countless people, seeing all this publicity, flocked to their headquarters to undertake AR's conversion therapy.  If that doesn't count as both relevant and notable, I don't know what does.  I rather think you have the burden of proof in this instance, making a case that AR was *not* relevant and notable in the history of conversion therapy in the U.S. [[User:Michaelbluejay|MichaelBluejay]] ([[User talk:Michaelbluejay|talk]]) 22:55, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

:To my knowledge, there are only a handful of sources that describe the history of conversion therapy as a whole. In fact, there are only two main sources, an article by Jack Drescher and another by Kenji Yoshino. Neither of these mentions Aesthetic Realism. So, per policies of due weight, Aesthetic Realism does not belong in the history section (and note that I'm not concerned only with Aesthetic Realism - I have been steadily removing large amounts of material about other processes and theories that supposedly change homosexuality because they likewise fail the test of due weight). Describing Aesthetic Realism, or anything else, as conversion therapy, directly or by implication, is original research unless there are sources that specifically describe it that way. Since there are multiple definitions of conversion therapy, rather than a single definition, it is not clear what it is supposed to mean to call something conversion therapy anyway, which is why we have to follow reliable sources as closely as we can. The statement in the opening sentence of the lead is not a definition of conversion therapy at all, only an explanation of its most important feature. Burden of proof is always on the person adding the material. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:03, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

:I won't revert again right away, but Michaelbluejay's readding of this material again [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=312266634&amp;oldid=312264247] is a serious mistake. None of the sources he uses appear to empoly the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot;. We have to limit the history section to things that sources describe as conversion therapy - otherwise it will become much too long, full of original research and undue material, and ultimately completely unmanageable. This is an article specifically about conversion therapy, not about attempts to change homosexuality generally, which is a much larger phenomenon that includes many things that are not necessarily conversion therapy. I would respectfully suggest that Michaelbluejay consider the complex issues facing the history section as a whole rather than focus only on Aesthetic Realism. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:20, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

:: Is there any [[WP:RS]] that describes AR using the phrase 'conversion therapy' or 'reparative therapy', or did they describe what they were doing as either of these?  If so, it should stay in - if not then it would be [[WP::OR]] to include it.  If it cannot be shown, and this is accepted, then Bergler ought to go back in, on the same logic.  He did not describe himself as doing CT, nor are there any sources so describing his work, but if any attempt to change homosexual orientation is to be included, then he obviously should as well.  We cannot arbitrarily pick and choose what is and isn't CT - there has to be a standard and it needs to be applied consistently. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:07, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

::: The term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; does not appear to have been used before the early 1990s. The Gonsiorek and Weinrich book is the earliest source I am aware of that uses it. Since Aesthetic Realism stopped promoting itself as a &quot;cure&quot; for homosexuality in 1990, it's most unlikely that there are any sources that describe it as conversion therapy, as the writers that produce the literature on the topic would have little reason to take an interest in it. Bergler is an entirely different question. It is true he did not describe his own work as conversion therapy, but that is not the point - the issue is whether reliable sources have described it that way. Yoshino includes Bergler as part of the history of conversion therapy in Covering, so there's no question it is relevant.

Thank you for discussing.  It's rather bizarre to me that we can't use the explanation of the subject in the intro of the article itself as an accurate description of what the subject is.  If the opening is truly inaccurate, then the solution is to fix the opening, not blot out added material that conforms to the opening.

You're right, the phrase &quot;conversion therapy&quot; wasn't used much before the 1990's, yet the U.S. history section goes back to 1909.  It seems unfair to dismiss AR as not CT just because it wasn't described when it was mostly written about using a term that didn't yet exist.  (And yes, it also seems unfair to expect others to have written about AR's CT posthumously using the new term.)

I don't know whether there are truly too many CT or CT-related programs for the history section, but certainly AR was rather notable, and one of the most visible in the the 1970's and 80's.  In any event, it would be helpful to know exactly how you're defining conversion therapy, and exactly why AR doesn't meet the definition.  (And again, I wouldn't say that AR's not being described as CT before the term CT even existed would count.  I want to know why AR doesn't meet the definition of CT, whatever that definition is.)

Anyway, here are some sources that suggest that AR is indeed CT, though I again insist strongly that use of the term CT should not be the final arbiter of inclusion.  The criteria should simply be whether the candidate meets the definition.

*The article itself cites Kronemeyer as having reviewed AR, though he decided it wasn't effective.  If the article trusts that Kronemeyer was relevant to CT, then things that Kronemeyer considered relevant to CT are indeed relevant.
* [http://www.bandung2.co.uk/Books/Files/Sex/Wrestling%20with%20God%20and%20Men%20-%20Homosexuality%20in%20the%20Jewish%20Tradition.pdf Wresting with God and Men], page 293, refers to AR's program for change as &quot;therapy&quot;, in a footnote from page 229, the subject of which is &quot;reparative therapy&quot; (a synonym listed in the intro to this WP article).
* [http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Judaism/2002/01/The-Gay-Orthodox-Underground.aspx?p=3 source This article] contains the following excerpt:
:''Consider &quot;Shalom,&quot; a gay Jewish physician in his early 40s who was in conversion therapy for 11 years....[After various other approaches] failed, he entered Aesthetic Realism, a New York-based group that works with gay people to change their sexual orientation.....[One day] he broke down in the cab and began crying. &quot;I felt emotionally raped,&quot; he says. &quot;I couldn't keep acting. I decided to accept it. At 31, I came out to myself.&quot; Conversion therapy, Shalom says, is emotionally destructive. He says a friend of his who was &quot;cured&quot; of gayness later tried to take his own life. &quot;You don't change,&quot; he says. &quot;You only end up hating yourself even more.&quot;'' [[User:Michaelbluejay|MichaelBluejay]] ([[User talk:Michaelbluejay|talk]]) 18:37, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

:: Please see my project page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/conversion_therapy_project] regarding the problems involved in creating a suitable lead for the article. Despite what you seem to be suggesting, the statement in the first sentence is indeed an accurate description of conversion therapy, as far as it goes. It is not a definition, because no one definition can be offered. The total absence of any direct mention of Aesthetic Realism in any source dealing with the history of conversion therapy means that the material you added about this does not meet the test of due weight. I doubt that Beliefnet is a reliable source, and in any case it does not say anything about Aesthetic Realism being a significant part of the history of conversion therapy. Determining what meets due weight should be based on proper academic sources rather than articles on a magazine-style website. Notability is irrelevant, because that concerns only what subjects may have articles created about them. That Kronemeyer (who is described as part of the history of conversion therapy by Yoshino) mentions Aesthetic Realism is the only possible reason why it might deserve a mention here, and any mention it might warrant would have to be extremely brief.

BornGay, you keep ignoring what I'm saying (including, but definitely not limited to, the fact that you haven't demonstrated how AR supposedly doesn't meet the definition of conversion therapy), you ignore most of my sources, and you unfairly dismiss the rest.  (e.g., The &quot;Wrestling&quot; article *certainly* implies that AR is conversion therapy, by name.)  As such I will stop discussing and continue to re-insert the relevant, sourced, and notable content back to the article, as many times as necessary.

::Michaelbluejay: I have not ignored what you said. I paid careful attention. What you said, however, was mostly wrong.

To BornGay:

# Please discuss here, not on my Talk page.
# Re: your saying &quot;Please do not continue to edit war over this,&quot; why don't you take your own advice?  Apparently your idea of my &quot;not continuing to edit war&quot; means &quot;letting BornGay have his way with the article&quot;.  No deal, no dice. You're clearly trying to assert ownership of the article.
# Re: your comment &quot;There are no sources that support the claim that Aesthetic Realism has anything more than a very minor relevance to the history of conversion therapy.&quot; This is patently untrue. You continue to ignore the plethora of sources which show that AR's CT was *highly* visible, promoted on television interviews, two books, a short film, and multiple large ads in the largest newspapers in the U.S.  (By the way, good job of ensuring you got the opening comment in the RfC, biasing everyone who visits with your false assertion that AR was only &quot;minor&quot;.)
# Re: your comment &quot;Refusing to discuss this is not acceptable, you must respect Wikipedia procedure.&quot; How many times have I asked you for a definition of Conversion therapy and for your argument of how AR does not meet that definition?  I have tried to get *you* to discuss, but you tend to just ignore, obfuscate, and keep changing your positions (e.g., First you say there are no sources, then when I provide one, your argument against is suddenly different.)  My meaning was that until *you* discuss in good faith, then I'm done discussing.
# I reject your spurious suggestion that the topic is inherently undefinable.  In any event, it's impossible to have an article on *any* subject unless there's some consensus of what the heck the subject is in the first place.
# Until you provide a definition of CT (which is incorporated into the article) and show how AR does not meet that definition, I don't believe you have any basis for removing AR from the article.
# The best way to resolve this in your favor would be for the article to clearly and unambiguously state, &quot;Conversion therapy is [definition]. It does not include [other definition] such as [Aesthetic Realism and other methods that are not CT].&quot;  That assumes that AR would not actually meet the definition of CT.  Everything I've seen leads me to believe that it does.
# Your concern that different sources define CT differently can certainly be incorporated into the WP intro.  In fact, if you believe that there is significant disagreement over the definition from reliable sources, that *ought* to be in the intro.

== Request for comment: Aesthetic Realism ==


Should the history section of Conversion therapy include [[Aesthetic Realism]]?

[[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 08:08, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

'''No'''. There are no sources that support the claim that Aesthetic Realism has anything more than a very minor relevance to the history of conversion therapy. Including the material would violate [[WP:DUE]]. It would also potentially open a floodgate to further [[WP:UNDUE]] material - about Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, primal scream therapy, the Nazis, Gunter Dorner, and nobody knows what else. There is simply no way that all this material can be included in the history section and it would be absurd to even try, as past discussions here have shown. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 08:15, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' If there is no [[WP:RS]] that describes this as CT (or RT) then ''No''.  If there is, then ''Yes''.   My understanding is there is not, so '''No'''. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:22, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' It may deserve an extremely brief mention because one writer identified as practicing conversion therapy mentions it, but if we include all the disputed material MichaelBluejay wants to include the end result is that the history section would have to be expanded to include ''all'' methods of attempting to change homosexuality. I tried the include-everything approach months ago, and eventually realized that it can't be made to work. See talk Archive 8 for the background. My current thoughts are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/conversion_therapy_project here]. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 09:30, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' I honestly don't know much about Aesthetic Realism.  The current lead says &quot;Conversion therapy, sometimes called reparative therapy, involves methods intended to convert gay, lesbian and bisexual people to heterosexuality.&quot;  It is important to be consistent throughout the article. If there are methods intended to convert gay, lesbians and bisexual people to heterosexuality which are not deemed to be a type of conversion therapy, that should be explained.  Otherwise, you are misleading the reader. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 00:27, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree with you both, and that used to be in the lead at one point, if I remember right (too late to play hunt the missing information); it needs to be brief.  If we start explaining all things that were not conversion therapy, then we would have to include [[Leucotomy]]/[[Lobotomy]], [[Electro-convulsive therapy]], [[Narcotherapy]], [[Surgical castration]], [[Chemical castration]], [[Aversion therapy]], [[Hormone therapy]], [[Rubber bands]], and so on, as well.  They would be mentioned as part of a brief historical note about the experimental treatments that have not worked and damaged people in the past, but not covered individually; they would be noted as not being conversion therapy.  They should be mentioned alongside that they were all dropped because they didn't tend to work and damaged people (i.e., people either ended up so messed-up by the treatment sex was the last thing they were worried about, or they survived and became gay or lesbian).  So this historical experimental treatment is in no more in need of its own section than any of those I listed (as these were sanctioned for use in psychiatric departments in the USA and Europe during the third quarter of the twentieth century).  While we are at it, perhaps we could say something about CT being the latest in a long line of experimental treatments to 'cure' people who are homosexual, and turn them into people who can play house and make babies in the traditional way? I guess a source would be out there somewhere for that, although without the language I used. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:02, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

'''Yes'''. It is sourced, neutral and clearly relevant. The fact that it is not mentioned by other sources may show that those sources are weak in this respect. In my research capacity I am always finding otherwise good sources lacking important aspects. This is not an argument for excluding sources, just an argument for including more varied sources, and not allowing some sources to rule because they are well thought of by some editors. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 14:49, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

== Edit warring warning ==

Two, possibly three, editors have now either stepped over [[WP:3RR]] in the past 24 hours or are close to it.  I am not going to name them, and I am not going to report them.  Despite some attempts to discuss these edits, there has been far more activity on the article than the discussion page.  This is a warning - this is not helping the article, and if anybody is trying to read this article, and going back and forth as they follow links, I am sure it is very confusing for them.  I have managed to restrain myself mostly (apart from the Ex-gay/NARTH synthesis in the lead).  I will continue to do so, unless I notice something ridiculous or faulty going in.  If the edit war persists, I will compile a report and submit it, and diff the edits of the three editors involved.  I would like to suggest that you cool off by agreeing on a moratorium for 24 hours to demonstrate good faith, and discuss the multiple edits and reversals on the talk page - that is what it is here for.  Continuing this way inevitably ends up with people being blocked and creates bad feeling. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 02:32, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

:Fair enough. I am trying to be more careful, and I don't think what you're doing is unreasonable. Note, however, that Knulclunk, who has restored the Jones/Yarhouse study multiple times, has simply ignored most of what I've said about it on the talk page, including my explanations of why it is inappropriate here. Based on this behavior, it appears that he or she is going to refuse to engage in further discussion, and will simply go on restoring this grossly misleading content. If my impression is mistaken, is it up to Knulclunk to show it by responding. It would be helpful if you could comment on what I said about the study. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 02:58, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

:: It would be a sign of good faith if the editor reverted the item he is keen to keep re-inserting.  I agree with you, if the authors explicitly say they are not looking at conversion therapy, but ex-gay ministries, and there is nothing to suggest this is about such therapy (i.e., reparative therapy instead), then if it goes anywhere, it should go in the [[Ex-gay]] article, not this one, as it is irrelevant - unless their own work directly influenced the development of conversion therapy.  I guess from what you are saying it didn't.  If we start to include religious ministries as conversion therapy, then we would need to include witch-doctors and ministers casting out evil spirits in Africa - I don't think that is the way to go really. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 03:37, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

::: That is the main problem with including the study here (not the fact that it's written by people who are in favour of converting gay people to heterosexuality - I believe in trying to edit in a neutral way, and would not exclude something for that reason). Jones and Yarhouse directly state that their study wasn't about conversion therapy and that its relevance to conversion therapy was limited at best. They did not claim to have proven anything about conversion therapy; including it here makes it look as though they did and misrepresents the study's purpose. Knulclunk has ignored this. In addition, this may not be a sufficiently reliable source for this purpose, as it was published by a religious press, not a conventional academic one.

:::Possibly some kind of compromise could be worked out here, but I am not sure it would work. The only way this study could be mentioned in the ex-gay section in a way that wasn't misleading would be to explain that Jones and Yarhouse did not consider ex-gay treatment a kind of conversion therapy, and that they concluded that their results might possibly have some limited and indirect relevance to conversion therapy. It might look rather odd, though, and I'm not sure that it would meet due weight. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 05:05, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm not quite sure why this section is still as it is. This is a POV essay by a dubious source about the evils of Ex-gay ministry that notes multiple unrelated factors of a single example taken more than a decade ago. Several editors have questioned its appropriateness. Attempts to remove by any editor it or even modify its wording has been met immediate reverting by the original contributor. Any attempts to offer equally sourced paragraphs is also met with immediate reverting by the original contributor. Who, while defending the edit on the talk page, still has continually broken [[WP:3RR]].

The book's being more than a decade old does not make it unacceptable as a source, in fact, as one of the earliest sources on conversion therapy, it's an ideal starting point, though I agree that we should be careful about how the material is presented. It does not surprise me that &quot;several editors&quot; have questioned its appropriateness. You are all wrong, and you are no less wrong because there are &quot;several&quot; of you.

To focus exclusively on the negative given by one author and by refusing to allow any other source be added is enforcing your point of view.  This section should be a summary of the main article.  There is no reason why the new APA findings cannot be included in there.  If ex-gays are considered conversion therapy, then we should accurately summarize ex-gays.  If not, we should take out the whole section.  The argument that the only source that can be admitted is one that shows it in a negative light because it specifically refers to it as a conversion therapy is a ridiculous argument and does not stand.

::: I have reconsidered what I said following BornGay's response to me.  This section should not be a summary, and I will explain why.  You seem to equate Ex-gay with conversion therapy, but that is not the case.  Conversion therapy exists independently of the Ex-gay movement, but SOME Ex-gay groups advocate it.  They do not undertake is, because they are not therapists, they are support groups.  The only aspect of the Ex-gay article (which is not NPOV in the way it deals with the topic) that is relevant is the section on Conversion therapy (because only some advocate this), but that is a brief account of CT.  There would be no point putting that here, as we cover it in more detail, and there would be no point summarising Ex-gay as most of it is irrelevant to this article.  All that needs doing is saying what it is, what the problems or benefits with them are according to relevant sources (APA, etc.), and the level of engagement with CT.  Notable psychologists who have undertaken studies, even critically, of Ex-gay in relation to CT would be relevant.  You have no right removing it.

No, my comment was not about sources, but why a summary of the ex-gay page would be irrelevant, as only material that relates to this article would be relevant, and there is too little detail to summarise.  I have no intention of wading in on the ex-gay page, it is a [[WP:SOAP]]. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 16:45, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

The APA source about ex-gay says this (immediately after the bit cited) &quot;These individuals and organizations tend to have negative attitudes toward homosexuality that are based in their particular religious perspectives. In general, efforts to change sexual orientation through religious ministries take the approach that sexual orientation can be changed through repentance and faith. In addition, some individuals and groups who promote efforts to change sexual orientation through therapy are also associated with religious perspectives that take a negative attitude toward homosexuality.&quot; which seems to clarify what they are and where they sit in relation to CT.  This ought to go in, as it is more informative than telling us it is also called 'transformational minstry'. The pamphlet seems to give some clarity about the differences between Ex-gay and CT. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 17:21, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I do think that the form of the section is better now than what was removed, apart from being completely inaccurate - so I have edited for accuracy. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 17:22, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

Our personal views about whether ex-gay ministries = conversion therapy or not are not relevant. Personally, I agree with Mish that they are not the same; however, I do not think her recent edits to the section have helped clarify things. Some reliable sources equate ex-gay ministries with conversion therapy, some insist they are distinct, and both views have to be presented neutrally; the way that was before was appropriate in terms of [[WP:NPOV]]. The sentence stating, &quot;Some ex-gay ministries advocate conversion therapy, while other ex-gay organizations use methods other than conversion therapy of trying to change homosexual sexual orientation&quot; does not explain the conflicting views that exist in reliable sources accurately (it obscures the fact that ex-gay ministries ''are'' conversion therapy according to some sources), and nor are the page references right. Page 374 of the Jones and Yarhouse book does clearly support the statement it sources (eg, some sources say ex-gay ministries aren't conversion therapy) in the version I added, but it seems to have nothing to do with the statement it's connected with in Mish's version.

It's ludicrous to say that the ex-gay section here should be a summary of the main article. It can't be, just as the Freud section can't be a summary of [[Sigmund Freud's views about homosexuality]], as that would include too much material about aspects of Freud's views on homosexuality that don't relate to changing it. The point is to include what is directly relevant. What goes here should depend on what reliable sources that discuss ex-gay ministries as conversion therapy say, which means that there is plenty of material (including Jones/Yarhouse) that would be appropriate to the ex-gay article that isn't appropriate here. Removing the section totally is not appropriate, and looks like an attempt to censor embarrassing material that is not welcomed by a certain POV. I would request replies on my talk page at the moment, as the talk page of this article has become extremely long. I've added a revised version of that section to my sandbox in response to criticism of the older version, and feedback would be helpful.

My point was that Knulclunk is ignorant of basic Wikipedia policy. I suggest Knulclunk try actually reading [[WP:NPOV]], which states, 'Wikipedia is filled with reliably sourced non-neutral statements, so the elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy solely on the grounds that it is &quot;POV&quot;.'

:They (Mainstream American medical and scientific organizations) recommend other treatments that could help clients change their sexual orientation identity without promising them a change in sexual orientation.
:They (Ex-gay groups) help counteract and buffer minority stress, marginalization, and isolation.
:A survey of 882 people with unwanted same-sex attractions were asked five questions about their experience with conversion therapy. Most found it was helpful to them psychologically, spiritually, and sexually, and had a significant reduction in the frequency of their homosexual thoughts and fantasies.
:The reports of harm and cure counterbalance each other.

What I liked about them is that had the statements that I listed above, mostly that the consensus emphasizes self-determination, that it accurately states that reports of harm and cure counterbalance each other, and is truthful that there is not sufficient evidence to say for sure that CT is either beneficial or harmful, it includes Nicolosi's study which was printed by the APA and quoted by the ACA, and it does not hide alternative therapies that can be useful for clients seeking to change their sexual orientation identity.

I think the new APA report is clear on that, and they don't think much of the self-determination argument, either. &quot;They recommend other treatments that could help clients change their sexual orientation identity without promising them a change in sexual orientation&quot; is something that clearly doesn't belong in the lead - if it's true it's a minor detail that would belong somewhere else. With the ex-gay section: &quot;They help counteract and buffer minority stress, marginalization, and isolation&quot; - that doesn't belong there, because it's sourced to the new APA report, and that's about SOCE, not conversion therapy.

:::::In the American medical consensus section, &quot;There is not sufficient evidence to determine the benefit or harm of such therapies, and there is extensive debate on the matter.&quot; The first part of that basically just repeats other things that were already there (such as &quot;The medical and scientific consensus in the United States is that conversion therapy is potentially harmful, but that there is no scientifically adequate research demonstrating either its effectiveness or harmfulness&quot;). The second part is irrelevant; the existence of debate is a different issue from the consensus. Debate is not part of a consensus. &quot;Another report indicated that most of the participants found that the therapy was helpful to them, psychologically, spiritually, and sexually&quot; - that part was completely inappropriate, as it wrongly presented Nicolosi as part of the consensus.

::::::Self-determination is a major part of their view points, and is part of their code of ethics. I agree that they are critical of conversion therapy.  I'm not arguing that.  All I am saying is that the client has the right to determine their own destiny in therapy. I also think it is important to be clear what it is exactly that the medical view objection is critical of.  It is specifically critical of conversion therapy, and not with anyone trying to help people with unwanted same-sex attractions.  Conversion therapy is ill-defined, as noticed, and since this article includes methods such as ex-gay groups which do not specifically try to change a person's sexual orientation, it is important to be clear on this issue.  That is why I wanted to include &quot;They recommend other treatments that could help clients change their sexual orientation identity without promising them a change in sexual orientation.&quot;  That makes it clear that the disagreement is specifically with conversion therapy and there other related therapies that would be more appropriate.  It is perfectly reasonable for an article on a medical treatment to discuss alternative treatments for the same condition, especially with an ill-defined topic which some readers may erroneously believe is more comprehensive than it actually is.

This sentence seems synthetic, and I am not averse to saying something, but would prefer it is more accurate and less weasely.  The self-determination is important, but if we are making a point of that, it needs to be qualified as per the source - in the context of freedom from social, family, peer pressure, etc.  This is where you run into a problem.  To balance the statements as per [[WP:NPOV]], you need to expand the content significantly to accurately report what the APA actually said, and that may well be undue for the lead, as it is about CT, not the APA's position on SOCE in detail.

On the issue of whether there is extensive debate, I suggest you look at this article in the Guardian (UK) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/mar/26/homosexuality-gay-cure-treatment-orientation British therapists still offer treatments to 'cure' homosexuality] which records that out of 1300 therapists, 55 were offering treatments for homosexuality, and 200 had attempted to change at least one person's sexual orientation.

: I don't believe it should be excluded, but handled for what it is, a minority view.  That means it is not the consensus - the consensus is that it is a crock of shit.  It gets dealt with as a minority view, and as such the coverage needs to be weighted to reflect this - coverage mainly about the majority view (i.e. the consensus), with a small amount on the minority view.  This seems to have been about right, but recent edits and insertions have unbalanced the coverage in a way that do not accurately reflect this.  Putting stuff in the consensus about views that are not part of the consensus not only unbalances the article, it renders it inaccurate.

== Criticism of ex-gay treatment must not be removed ==

Joshuajohanson has recently removed all criticism of ex-gay treament from the ex-gay section. This edit[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=313015472&amp;oldid=312958575], like the similar edits performed by Hyper3 ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=312339073&amp;oldid=312323448] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=312748778&amp;oldid=312748367]), is unacceptable for several reasons. [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] requires that the extensive criticism of ex-gay treatment by published scholars and mainstream scientific organizations be represented here, and the principles that NPOV, and the related key policies of no original research and verifiability, are based upon, and which require fair treatment of all significant views, cannot be over-riden by consensus. And while there may be a group of editors here (consisting of Joshuajohanson, Knulclunk, and Hyper3) who don't like seeing ex-gay treatment criticized and want the criticism gone, you do not form a consensus by yourselves, and your not liking the criticism is not a reason why it should be removed. While the three of you can contest the criticism as much as you like, there is no basis in the content policies for keeping it out. 

Many of the arguments that the editors on that side have offered have been preposterous. Knulclunk's complaints that the criticism is based upon a &quot;POV&quot; essay show a basic misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV]], which states that &quot;Wikipedia is filled with reliably sourced non-neutral statements, so the elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy solely on the grounds that it is 'POV'&quot;, thus contradicting his position. Hyper3's comments in an edit summary that we should, &quot;Take out &quot;attack&quot; aspects, and choose better studies, exemplary of their positions and with due weight&quot;, are likewise misinformed. He appears to thinks that only ex-gay studies that have not been demolished by scholarly criticism, as the Pattison's study was demolished, should be mentioned in the article, which reflects such a gross misunderstanding of NPOV as to require little comment. It is questionable whether there are any good ex-gay studies, so his comment betrays a lack of understanding of conversion therapy itself, as well as the content policies. Those ex-gay studies that might possibly be better than the study done by the Pattisons, like the Jones and Yarhouse study, are not within the scope of the article. Fortunately, judging from other comments here, a larger number of editors accept that criticism in some form is necessary. There may be disagreements over the details or the precise wording that should be used, but given that most of the opinions here have supported criticism, I am going to add some in a revised form.

In reply to Joshuajohanson's claim that my position that sources (such as the new APA report) that do not identify ex-gay ministries as conversion therapy should not be used to back up statements about ex-gay treatment is indefensible, I would observe that it's not such a simple issue. I am not ''absolutely'' sure that the new APA report should not be used as a source for the ex-gay section, but nor am I yet convinced that it should be. I would suggest a careful re-reading of [[WP:NOR]], which states that &quot;To demonstrate that you are not presenting original research, you must cite reliable sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and that directly support the information as it is presented.&quot; Since the new APA report is about SOCE, rather than conversion therapy, it does not relate ''directly'' to the subject of this article. If you want to properly source the kind of statements you want to add to that section, you would probably need other sources in addition to the APA report. While this issue may be disputed, [[WP:NOR]] is clear that one cannot use a source contrary to the intention of its authors, so the Jones/Yarhouse study, which directly states it isn't about conversion therapy, definitely cannot be used here in that manner. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 07:48, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

: I agree with you, just because the Ex-gay article lacks such criticism is not a reason for such criticism being excised here - especially of the source relates to the article topic in conjunction with ex-gay ministries.  I also agree that the recent report by the APA cannot be used in this way under this section - it goes to some pains to refer to ex-gay as distinct from conversion therapy, as it only refers to ex-gay support groups, ex-gay groups, ex-gay religious ministries, ex-gay ministries.  Placing the recent APA source as relating to ex-gay ministries would be [[WP:SYNTH]]. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 09:40, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree that there should be criticism of ex-gay SOCE. I don't like the particular source that Born Gay is using, because it focusses on impropriety, something that happens everywhere. I don't mind impropriety being mentioned (because, quite correctly, it is Christians who are claiming propriety, and I understand it is necessary to expose hypocrisy).  We should choose a better example that is just as clearly critical. There should also be a pro ex-gay study, like Yarhouse, and then there should be some work to make sure due weight is in favour of the critical.[[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 11:50, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:::Hyper3 is correct. The problem with the criticism that was being used focused on the impropriety of a small group. Examples of impropriety are universal. A broader study showing false assumptions of the ex-gay movement would be acceptable. Even better though, are sources expressing social concerns over the promotion of ex-gay ministry from both scientific and activist sources, as long as we note them as such. With this should be a definition of who supports ex-gay ministries and why. It is appropriate to explain that supporters of ex-gay ministry usually do not define there mission as &quot;conversion therapy&quot; from homosexual to heterosexual. But, to discuss ex-gay without acknowledging its supporters is misleading and disingenuous.  
:::I disagree with Hyper3's desire for to expose hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is also universal and the need to play &quot;gotcha&quot; with Christians (even when they are claiming propriety) is unseemly. --[[User:Knulclunk|Knulclunk]] ([[User talk:Knulclunk|talk]]) 13:56, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

::::: If we took the view that &quot;If it is documented, and relevant, it stays in&quot; then much reverted editing would still be in the article. Giving undue weight to one view by quoting scandal, and then not including other views is problematic. From the above, we could agree a version of this section in a second if the references to impropriety were removed, and other equally relevant and critical sources included, together with the Yarhouse material.

== Content ==

OK, so, before we start hacking away again...

This article is called Conversion therapy, and refers to Reparative therapy.  Can we discuss a clear definition of what this article is about, and what is and is not to be covered.

* Conversion therapy
* Reparative therapy
* Ex-gay ministries
* Therapies that pre-date the coinage of the term

Clarifying this, and stating this in the lead, might help to resolve some of the disputed issues.

* We take CT to cover with both issues here (otherwise we would need a separate article for RT).  For an individual/organisation to be included, there must be documentary evidence that they claim to be (or are seen as) practicing CT/RT.
* My understanding is that Ex-gay ministries (and religious conservatives) sometimes support CT/RT, so they should only be mentioned briefly in their support of CT/RT, not in context of CT/RT practice.
* Therapists/therapies that pre-date the term should only be included if they have retrospectively been described as CT/RT, or of it has been documented that they have directly influenced contemporary CT/RT.
* This all has to be sourced to relevant reliable sources (reliable books, papers, articles, etc. - rather than promotional websites etc.)

Can we have this discussion before resuming editing, and formulate a statement for the lead that covers this.[[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 10:12, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

:The terms, like all definitions, are slippery, and it will not be possible to put clear boundaries on it. Language develops, is used differently, becomes conflicted (and therefore some try to distance themselves from terms that clearly apply). &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; is an attempt to differentiate from conversion therapy, so that gives us a problem immediately. I think we should not consider &quot;conversion therapy&quot; to be a technical term but a descriptive term used in the context of sexual behaviour change. We should, therefore, allow any attempts to adapt sexual behaviour in the context of a &quot;talking cure&quot; to be described, and all parties who have opinions on it to be represented with due weight, both scientifically and sociologically. Otherwise, the article will need to demerge conversion therapy and reparative therapy... [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 10:54, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

:: They are slippery, so the way we do this is to refer to the best reliable sources, and report what they define it as.  If they slip further, then that can be dealt with another time.  For now, what we need to do, is look at how it is defined by notable professional associations etc., and recognised professionals who use the term to describe what they do.[[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 12:35, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

::: I've looked at the book you are suggesting. the problem is that this approach presumes a unitary approach to knowledge; it presumes that we will get better and better at integrating and agreeing what we think about a matter, especially if we tighten up our definitions. Your &quot;best reliable sources&quot; won't be mine. I think that knowledge is not unitary, suffers from all sorts of incommensurable divides, and therefore we have to negotiate across unclear boundaries. If we start with a book like that you suggest, then we will end up with an article like the book. You are never going to convince the Aesthetic Realism chap that his concerns fall outside of this article for example. More to the point, Wikipedia rules don't cover this. As long as editors stick to neutrality, weight and verifiability, it is allowed into the article. Therefore we record opinions that have divergent ethical standpoints; those that believe in a unitary approach to knowledge, and those that believe it is really all about power; those that operate from inside a tradition and those that believe they are using their autonomous rationality. There is no way around this, as this is the state of play within [[epistemology]]. Most people are satisfied that [[foundationalism]] is dead. In any case, as there is no shortage of paper. Hopefully we are giving people the tools to discover what the debate surrounding the topic is, many possible meanings within the debate, and the fact that like may other debates, it wanders around a number of possible subject areas. This is what I propose as a consensual approach, doomed as it is by what I have just said! [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 14:19, 8 September 2009 (UTC)
:::: This is not the place for a discussion about epistemology.  This is an encyclopedia.  There are policies and guidelines that guide us in a way we don't need to concern ourselves with philosophical issues that are more relevant to articles in the encyclopedia that deal with those topics.  All we need to ask is 'Is Drescher a [[WP:RS]]', 'are the APAs [[WP:RS]]', 'what is the consensus and what is the minority view', fortunately these questions are easy to answer.  Whereas Foucauldian debates about knowledge and power are less easy, and best dealt with on the [[Michel Foucault]] article's talk page.

It would be wrong to make up our own definition of conversion therapy, or to try to impose a single definition of conversion therapy on the article, when the fact is that there is no one definition. There are several different definitions in reliable sources, and the point of the terminology section is to explain them. The lead starts by explaining something about conversion therapy rather than by defining it, and includes the views of the two different APAs on the subject. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 21:45, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

: I agree with you, it is not our definition that matters, it is how it is defined by reliable sources.  In some other articles, terms (or phrases) are defined in the first sentence of the lead, and where there are a range of meanings, the various understandings are explained, as detailed in reliable sources as the first paragraph.  This would be appropriate for this article, as this could help to define and circumscribe the scope of the article for those who wish to edit the article, and diminish the potential for future misunderstandings. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:20, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

::[[WP:LEAD]] says that, &quot;The first paragraph of the introductory text needs to unambiguously define the topic for the reader, without being overly specific.&quot; In this case that is not possible, because of the multiple definitions in sources; giving only one would conflict with NPOV. Fortunately guidelines permit occasional exceptions, and this is a case when an exception is necessary. It's best for the opening sentence to side-step the issue of definition entirely and give the definitions of conversion therapy from reliable sources later in the lead.

Moved from article:

They published two books&lt;ref name=HPersuasion&gt;The H Persuasion: How Persons Have Permanently Changed from Homosexuality through the Study of Aesthetic Realism with Eli Siegel (1971), Sheldon Kranz (ed.), Definition Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and one short film on the subject&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/411076 Yes We Have Changed (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;, and purchased ads in major newspapers promoting their supposed success.&lt;ref name=&quot;cult&quot;&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/homosexuality.html Aesthetic Realism's “cure” for homosexuality (April 2009, accessed September 6, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 the Foundation stopped offering its treatment, citing the spirit of anger surrounding the subject that it didn't wish to be involved with&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counteringthelies.com/m_carpenter.html The Lie about How Aesthetic Realism Sees Homosexuality], Margot Carpenter (accessed September 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;, though critics contend that the Foundation was forced to abandon their program because it wasn't working.&lt;ref name=&quot;cult&quot;/&gt;
To begin with, the linked [[Aesthetic Realism Foundation]] does not remotely describe the organization discussed here, so that needs to go. The only critical source is a cult-outing site, and while I have no doubt that ARF was a cult, this is not the best sourcing. The other source is a promotional site by the Executive Director (founder?), self described as a &quot;consultant and poet&quot; - completely inappropriate as a source. I'd prefer to see that this was more mainstream, and had at least some significant impact - and some better sourcing. Did this poet have any coverage by anyone remotely neutral and a significant RS?

{{reflist}}

It is worth remembering that whatever is or is not done with the Aesthetic Realism material will have implications for the history section as a whole. It should be considered in that context, as it may set a precedent for the inclusion or exclusion of many other kinds of material. Ideally the history section should be sourced to things that specifically discuss the history of conversion therapy, since there is a risk otherwise that we would not be using sources in a way that respects their intention, as [[WP:NOR]] requires. A strict interpretation of that policy might require that the entire history section be sourced to books or articles that are intended as disussions of the history of conversion therapy; it that case, it would have to be completely rewritten, based on the two key histories that have been published, and its scope would be drastically narrowed.

== Jones/Yarhouse ==

In brief: This is not a study, but a book, written by two authors who are presenting a strong American conservative Christian POV - Jones also wrote books subtitled &quot;God's Design for Sex&quot; and &quot;Why God Cares About Sex&quot; and Yarhouse co-wrote two books both sub-titled &quot;A Comprehensive Christian Appraisal&quot;  . The source being used is from Christianity Today, a partisan source. The &quot;study&quot; cherry picked participants (they wanted 300, had to settle for 98, and lost 25 of them along the way), and then skewed findings to the point that homosexual men who simply weren't currently in a relationship at the time were counted in the &quot;cured&quot; column, which skewed the reported &quot;ex-gay&quot; rate. This is, I repeat, not a study. A study is conducted by impartial professionals, who take care to begin with a broad representative sampling, who utilize strict methods, and report their findings without fear or favor in a professional publication. This book is a soapbox for the cause. Born Gay has added to these reasons to omit the book that the two authors themselves do not characterize their methods as conversion therapy and that they regard their study of ex-gay treatment as having no direct relevance to conversion therapy. I have asked several times why it is thought this should be included, and am still awaiting a clear response. Does anyone have a clear argument for inclusion, or may we lay this matter to bed?

Unlike KillerChihuahua, I do not oppose their inclusion, as long as their partisan source is acknowledged. 
:The criticism uses the term &quot;suspect testimonials&quot;, which many readers will interpret the as POV or the source as dubious [[WP:RS]].The language is improved by including Halderman's name, but it would be nice to know who this guy is and why we should trust his intemperate opinion. There is also a POV problem with  the conclusion &quot;...data were unconvincing, founded on a poorly described treatment program that used ill-defined constructs.&quot; This is a conclusion that could be deduced from any reader, so to tack it onto the end of the paragraph seems unnecessary and agenda pushing. The recent edits acknowledging Halderman is better, but I still don't know why I should trust him any more that any other motivated activist.

== Worldwide view ==

This article focuses mainly on Europe and USA. The stance of China and India is not mentioned, and the WHO stance is not mentioned in the intro. It has been argued that is because there is less material available. I would argue that just because these countries do not have as large of an internet presence, does not mean that their views should be ignored. Many countries follow the WHO stance, and it would be a disservice to them not to ignore them just because they don't have as many sources available on the internet in English.  We know what the WHO stance is, and that should be clear in the introduction. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:30, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

: The reason countries don't have such a presence is because when they use languages other than English, and most of us who use the English encyclopedia use English, and do searches on Google etc., it returns English hits, not other languages.  Some countries are less open than the USA or other English-speaking countries.  I am concerned with English-language sources for this encyclopedia, and those are what I get, if there is information in English on other countries, then provided it is [[WP:RS]] and conforms to [[WP:NPOV]], then these will be used.  I agree though, some summary would be good, if English language sources can be found.  [[Homosexuality in China]] might be a place to start.

If you have further information beyond ICD.10 on what the WHO position is, and sources, I'd be interested to see what the WHO position on conversion therapy is, as I've not turned up anything and was unaware they had announced a position.  The only reference I can find is under ICD.10 code F66.1, of which part of the diagnosis for that psychiatric condition is that individuals may seek to change their sexual orientation (no mention of what the treatment for the condition is, nor mention of CT specifically). [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 22:57, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

The WHO's position is not one of the main points of the article, it is mentioned only briefly in the article, and does not deserve to be in the lead.

== NPOV flag ==

This article is not NPOV.  Here are some problems with the article:
* The WHO lists [[egodystonic sexual orientation]] under Psychological and behavioural disorders and does say that patients &quot;may seek treatment in order to change it.&quot;  This is mentioned in the article, but it is not mentioned in the lead and the main article gives too much weight to the American standpoint.  India follows the WHO listing and practices conversion therapy.  There is no reason to give America more weight than India.
* The American Psychiatric Association has stated: &quot;anecdotal reports of &quot;cures&quot; are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm&quot;.[http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001a.aspx]  However, this article does not counterbalance the cures with the harm.  This needs to be addressed.
* There are other benefits of conversion therapy. Here are some good studies to include: [http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/18481660/Clients_perceptions_of_how_reorientation_therapy_and_self-help_can_promote_changes_in_sexual_orientation] [http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;fuseaction=showUIDAbstract&amp;uid=2000-00515-002]
* Almost every single statement has talked about the importance of self-determination.  This needs to be addressed in the article.
* The American Psychological Association has stated &quot;Whereas the ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of therapies that seek to reduce or eliminate same-gender sexual orientation are under extensive debate in the professional literature and the popular media.&quot;[http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html]  This debate is ignored and it seems as if there is a consensus in the professional literature.  There used to be a good discussion of the debate, but this was removed. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=227104903&amp;oldid=227104206#Debate_within_professional_literature]  All of it was published by reliable sources.
* The APA stated &quot;sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events&quot; I would like the article to mention this.
All of these things needed to be added. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:06, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:You are correct that the article does have POV problems, but in my view you haven't correctly identified any of them. The main POV problem here is the inclusion of undue material in the history section, something which I admit that I am partly responsible for, but which I intend to remedy by removing it. It's entirely appropriate that the WHO statement not be mentioned in the lead, as it is not one of the article's main points. The article does not give too much emphasis to the American viewpoint, since sources that deal with conversion therapy happen to focus mainly on the United States. Suggesting that the article should give India as much weight as America is silly. The exclusion of the quotations you mention from the American medical consensus section is not a problem either, since the purpose of it is to summarise the main views, not to offer quotations.

:If you want to change the article in any of the ways you suggest, then please propose changes on the talk page first and see if consensus for them can be reached. Proposed changes should be dealt with one by one, and each will be considered on its own merits, or lack of them. Adding a &quot;neutrality disputed&quot; flag to the article isn't a particularly helpful thing to do - views on this issue tend to be sharply polarized, and I suppose that no matter what the article says someone will always say that it isn't neutral. Adding the tag is not a responsible thing to do unless you can explain exactly what changes would satisfy you that the article was neutral, and I do not think it should stay just because one editor wants it.

:And since you make an issue of my removal of the debate within professional literature section, I will say that I stand by that and still consider removing it the correct decision. I have changed my mind about other issues, but not about this.

::I've tried to add things into this article to make it more neutral, but it gets reverted with the only explanation of being &quot;let's discuss it&quot;, but then no actual discussion takes place.  This article is FAR from NPOV.  Hopefully with the NPOV tag in place, it will give motivation for editors to work together.  The flag means neutrality is disputed, not that there is consensus that the article is not neutral.  You ask me to &quot;explain exactly what changes would satisfy you that the article was neutral.&quot;  I have made a list.  There are many things wrong with this article, so simply fulfilling that list won't be enough, but it is a start.

::One of the problems is that you don't like quotes and Destino doesn't like my summaries.  Somehow that just ends meaning anything that either of you two don't like gets removed.  I can't work with that.  I am sick of it.  I gave up on this article awhile back because of that problem.  All you have to do to remove content you don't like is find one problem with it, whether it be you don't like the summary, it has too many quotes, it doesn't have enough quotes, or anything you want.  Fine, edit it, don't remove it.  I hope that the NPOV tag will encourage us to work together rather than separately.

:::If you are referring to your additions to the lead, I removed them because I considered them unnecessary and unhelpful. I still do. Per [[WP:LEAD]], the lead is a summary of the main points of the article, and there is no way that the material you added could be considered that. It might well belong somewhere else, but not in the lead. The article does indeed have POV problems, but as I said, you don't seem to understand what they are, and nor have you shown any interest in discussing them. The NPOV tag is divisive and does absolutely nothing to improve the article. If you think that it is reasonable to add a neutrality disputed tag simply because one editor thinks the article is not neutral, then the result will be that this article will always have a neutrality disputed tag, because there is always going to be some editor who thinks it is not neutral, no matter what it says. I can't say what your intentions are, but to an external observer it almost might look as though you want to add the tag simply because you haven't got your way here and therefore want to spoil things by adding something that implies that the article is no good.

:::To repeat some points: it is ''completely'' unreasonable to add the tag if you cannot or will not explain under what circumstances you would agree to have it removed. If it has any place at all, that could be only because there are specific problems that could be fixed by some defined, agreed-upon method, not because one editor has vague and incompletely explained concerns about an article that no one knows how to satisfy.

:::Although it is only an essay, I would direct your attention to [[WP:NPOVD]], which states, &quot;Drive-by tagging is strongly discouraged. The editor who adds the tag must address the issues on the talk page, pointing to '''specific issues that are actionable within the content policies''', namely [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]], [[Wikipedia:No original research]] and [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]]. Simply being of the opinion that a page is not neutral is not sufficient to justify the addition of the tag.

Suppose other editors form a consensus that your proposed changes are not appropriate or necessary - what then? Will you still insist that the tag remain even in the face of such a consensus?

I concede that the WHO position might not deserve as much weight as the APA, but seeing how most of the world uses the WHO, I think it is reasonable to want something from them in the lead.

:::::::To repy to Knulclunk: Joshuajohanson is simply wrong in many of his claims. It is not a &quot;POV problem&quot; that the lead does not mention that &quot;WHO lists [[egodystonic sexual orientation]] under Psychological and behavioural disorders and does say that patients 'may seek treatment in order to change it.'&quot; This information is not one of the main points of the article, and it would be undue for the lead. It is also not a  POV problem that America is given more weight than India here, that too is as it should be, as sources dealing with conversion therapy tend to focus on America, not India. Joshuajohanson's comment that &quot;this article does not counterbalance the cures with the harm&quot; appears to suggest that he wants the article to state that some people have been cured of homosexuality through conversion therapy, but stating that would create a POV problem, not solve one. The removal of the debate within professional literature section was appropriate, despite what Joshuajohanson suggests, since that section had no material in it that could not be more usefully placed in different sections, mainly the American medical consensus and Studies of converison therapy sections. Some of that material might perhaps be restored, but not the whole section. Joshuajohanson's remark that, &quot;The APA stated 'sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events', I would like the article to mention this&quot; suggests to me that he has misinterpreted the new APA report, which in my view does ''not'' say that conversion therapy can necessarily change sexual orientation identity. The issue should no doubt be mentioned, but we need to avoid misinterpreting what the APA actually says. However, if you think that Joshuajohanson is right on any of these points, then please explain why you think he is right. Simply asserting that he is right is not of any help by itself.

Mainly it was just a collection of quotations, few of which appeared to be chosen on any clear basis. There was almost no information about &quot;debate&quot; (in the sense of how different writers have responded to each other) there, so in addition to its contents being poorly chosen, the section itself was poorly named.

:::::::::::No it doesn't. The new APA report was largely dismissive of that argument.

What part of self-determination are they largely dismissive of?  They say the client can pursue whatever lifestyle they want, and that a therapist should allow the client to develop a heterosexual identity if they so chose.  They shouldn't claim to be able to change sexual orientation, but the client can do whatever they want. The medical view does not try to force any type of lifestyle on anyone. This article as currently written makes it seem as if the medical organizations are trying to force a gay lifestyle on individuals, when in reality they are perfectly content with clients living a straight lifestyle.

Mentioning self-determination outside the context of criticism gives the wrong impression. Regarding the new report, see chapter 7, especially the part stating &quot;We believe that simply providing SOCE to clients who request it does not necessarily increase self determination but rather abdicates the responsibility of LMHP to provide competent assessment and interventions that have the potential for benefit with a limited risk of harm.&quot; [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 22:51, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

The quote from the APA (&quot;In summary, if clients still decide that they wish to seek conversion therapy as a form of treatment, counselors should also help clients understand what types of information they should seek from any practitioner who does engage in conversion therapy&quot;) doesn't sound to me like emphasizing self-determination; it looks more like de-emphasizing it.

:::::::::::::::I think that is because self-determination is emphasized elsewhere, in context of other therapies, since simply providing SOCE doesn't increase self-determination. Self-determination can be increased through other therapies. Other therapies and approaches are emphasized in these reports, if we are going strictly by what is emphasized in these reports. It is emphasized much more that &quot;the advancement of conversion therapy may cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation.&quot;  I don't think that belongs in the lead, since it is mostly about the advancement of conversion therapy and its affects on society at large, rather than with the people who are requesting conversion therapy.  You still haven't convinced me that self-determination doesn't belong in the lead, but for now, how about we talk about self-determination in the consensus rather than the lead, and we talk about other therapies in the lead?

The sentence about the advancement of conversion therapy causing &quot;social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation&quot; does belong in the lead, since this is an article about conversion therapy generally, not about the people who request it. The medical consensus section has many complicated problems, and discussion here, which increasingly seems circular, has not addressed any of them properly. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 01:45, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

:::::::::::::::::I disagree with you, but for now, can I put it in the guidelines section instead of the lead?  Do you have any objections to me putting in material about self-determination and related therapies that respect self-determination better than conversion therapy in the ethical guidelines section?

::::::::::::::::::I can't say, because I don't know precisely what you intend to add; your explanation of that is unclear. I'm not sure why material about &quot;related therapies that respect self-determination better than conversion therapy&quot; should be here, because this an article about conversion therapy, after all. It sounds a little like you plan to add something that's off-topic. [[User:Born Gay|Born Gay]] ([[User talk:Born Gay|talk]]) 23:39, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
(unindented)I plan to write something under the APA section along the lines of &quot;A 2009 report reaffirmed earlier rulings.  They recommended other therapies that do not claim to change sexual orientation, but assists the patient to understand the reasons for wanting to change, and guides them in the formation of a new identity that would be acceptable to them, including the rejection of gay identity.&quot;  The section is on the guidelines, and the guidelines outlines what is appropriate and what is not.  This is the appropriate alternative to conversion therapy, as outlined in the guidelines. To censure this information would be misleading, as it would imply that all efforts to help people with unwanted same-sex attractions were condemned by the mainstream medical association.  I would like a discussion of what to add.  If you have a problem with my summary, I would like to know what exactly is your problem so that we can come together to find a mutually acceptable solution.  However, misleading the reader to think that self-determination is not an issue and there is no acceptable alternative to conversion therapy is not acceptable.  If we cannot come to a mutually agreeable solution, I will put up a misleading flag, as I feel that current article is misleading.

== What is Consensus? ==

Since there has been much discussion here about the need to make edits based upon consensus, it may be helpful to remind ourselves what policy states about how consensus is determined.

[[WP:CONSENSUS]] states that, &quot;In determining consensus, consider the quality of the arguments, the history of how they came about, the objections of those who disagree, and existing documentation in the project namespace. The quality of an argument is more important than whether it comes from a minority or a majority.&quot; So, consensus is not only about counting heads, but also about determining what policy requires. This is important, because some of the arguments being made here do not refer to policy and evade the requirement to justify one's positions with policy. Joshuajohanson's comments above in the Bioenergetics thread are an example of this evasion of the obligation to explain how policy supports one's position.

I explained that the Bioenergetics section depends upon a synthesis of sources and thus violates [[WP:NOR]], but Joshuajohanson's response was simply to say that it was &quot;good content&quot;; he made no attempt to refute my argument that it was synthesis. When I pointed this out to him, his response was to say that there was &quot;no consensus&quot; to remove it. Since determining consensus has to take into account the quality of arguments, and Joshuajohanson's arguments have been of very poor quality, his position that there is no consensus for removal needs to be questioned. I would point out to him that in the end, there is no way that content can be justified without a reason based on policy to keep it here, and that complaining that there is no consensus for removal is of no use if one has a mistaken understanding of how consensus is determined. BG 05:48, 19 September 2009 (UTC)
== Proposed changes ==

Article protection expires in about a day, so I'm going to discuss some changes I want to make.

In addition to removing the Bioenergetics section, these include adding the sections on group therapy and psychoanalysis in my sandbox to Theories and Techniques, tweaking the lead by removing &quot;fantasy modification&quot; from the list of methods (since Haldeman considers fantasy modification to be one specific technique of behavioral methods, and does not discuss it as a separate method), and removing the NARTH quote from the lead, since it is not supported by consensus and no explanation of why it should be considered necessary has been given.

I think some consideration should be given to removing the quotation from the start of the Studies of conversion therapy section. I've challenged the relevance of the new report to the ex-gay section of this article, so by the same logic, it's necessary to challenge its relevance to the studies section too. If it can't be used to source statements about conversion therapy that might look positive, it can't be used to source critical statements either; per NPOV, we can't have any double standards. BG 03:25, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

: Instead of a summary describing the changes you wish to make, in future (starting now) could you provide links to what you are talking about.  Links to what you intend to remove or change, links to the proposed insertion or amendment.  This will make it easier for other editors to see what you are talking about. Thanks. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:24, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::I'm not sure exactly what you're requesting. The Bioenergetics section and the other things in the article are easy to find and don't really need links. My sandbox is here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/Sandbox]. Some of the other sections, including the behavioral modification and sex therapy sections, could do with being expanded. BG 08:55, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:::Please do not make any changes until you have reached a consensus. The proposed addition of group psychology is unbalanced because it relies on one source that considers it to be conversion therapy and ignores other relevant changes.  The proposed change brings the focus on how conversion therapy affects the gay population at large, but ignores the right of self-determination of those who it would directly affect.  The quote should not be removed because there is no consensus to remove information from the APA.  BG has decided to remove information from the APA from the ex-gay section, but has not achieved the consensus of the group at large.  I still think the APA should be included in order to give a balanced view to the ex-gay section. The quote should not be removed from the Studies section.  Fantasy modifications should also not be removed.  You rely too heavily on a misinterpreted view of Haldeman's report. Please do not make any changes until you have reached a consensus.

::::Well, as you know, I want to keep the description of what reparative therapists think they are doing in the lead; a quotation from an APA leader using a NARTH source. Mish moved it to where it is, and BG is the only one that consistently wants to remove it. So that means there is no consensus to remove it either, but there might be some support to keep it. Continually saying that there is no explanation for it being there, when I continue to explain its presence is inaccurate. If someone wants to propose a more accurate version, I would be happy to comment. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 14:41, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::The lead is supposed to be a summary of the rest of the article.  I propose we take out the information about how this affects the gay population at large out of the lead, since this isn't directly about conversion therapy, but only related information.  Either that or we include other related information, such as alternative treatments.  The NARTH standpoint, self determination and WHO is directly about conversion therapy and should be in the lead.  The ex-gay section depends to heavily on one point of view, one that believes it is a type of conversion therapy.  The mainstream point of view does not classify it as conversion therapy.  The relationships between ex-gay groups and conversion therapy must be presented equally, with the mainstream view given dominance over all other views. Until there is another page available, related therapies should be discussed here, but it should be made clear that they are related therapies.  I also think the ethical guidelines section should include the new APA report. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 16:42, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

Joshuajohanson: you request me not to make changes until there is a consensus. I hope this means that you, also, will not make changes until there is a consensus, something that you have done numerous times in the past (one other editor agreeing with you does not a consensus make, especially not where controversial issues are concerned). You write, &quot;The proposed addition of group psychology is unbalanced because it relies on one source that considers it to be conversion therapy and ignores other relevant changes.&quot; The first part of that is absurd - obviously group therapy is only relevant to this article to the extent that sources define it as conversion therapy. Haldeman does, so he is the right source. You have provided no argument against my position on this. I can't make any sense of what you mean by saying that the addition &quot;ignores other relevant changes&quot; - what are you talking about? BG 21:35, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

You also write, &quot;The proposed change brings the focus on how conversion therapy affects the gay population at large, but ignores the right of self-determination of those who it would directly affect.&quot; How is that relevant? Again, I can't even make out what you're trying to say; could you explain yourself more carefully, please? If you're trying to argue that all sections of &quot;Theories and techniques&quot; must mention the right to self-determination you keep talking about, I happen to disagree. You write that, &quot;The quote should not be removed because there is no consensus to remove information from the APA.&quot; I think the quote should be removed mainly because it isn't necessary. A section on studies of conversion therapy should describe studies of conversion therapy, and nothing more. If the new APA report is deemed relevant to the article at all, then that material might go somewhere else. BG 21:38, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

Some other points. You say, &quot;Fantasy modifications should also not be removed.&quot; Yes it should. I explained my reasons for this. Haldeman does not discuss &quot;fantasy modifications&quot; as a separate method but as one kind of behavioral modification. Could you please respond to the reason I gave, rather than simply disagree with me? You also say, &quot;You rely too heavily on a misinterpreted view of Haldeman's report.&quot; No. There's no misinterpretation in anything that I based on Haldeman. If you think there is misinterpretation, it's up to you to show that. BG 21:40, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

To reply to Joshuajohanson again. You say, &quot;The ex-gay section depends to heavily on one point of view, one that believes it is a type of conversion therapy. The mainstream point of view does not classify it as conversion therapy. The relationships between ex-gay groups and conversion therapy must be presented equally, with the mainstream view given dominance over all other views. Until there is another page available, related therapies should be discussed here, but it should be made clear that they are related therapies.&quot; [[WP:NOR]] indicates that sources must not be used contrary to their intention, and must be directly related to the subject of an article. If a source does not indicate that ex-gay groups are a form of conversion therapy, then using it to source a description of them ''as a form of conversion therapy'' (which is the only respect in which the article is concerned with them) is using it contrary to its intention. Using a source that isn't explicitly about conversion therapy to source claims about conversion therapy probably violates the rule that sources must be directly related to the subject of the article. Furthermore, you are wrong in saying that the &quot;mainstream&quot; point of view does not classify ex-gay groups as conversion therapy. There is no one mainstream point of view on this issue. That being the case, your proposal to give what you consider the &quot;mainstream view&quot; dominance over views would introduce a POV slant into the article. That's unacceptable. BG 22:25, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:The source doesn't specifically say that having sex with you client is a form of conversion therapy, but it is related to conversion therapy.  The APA doesn't exactly call ex-gay therapies a type of conversion therapy, but it is related in that ex-gay therapies have been brought up. I also have serious doubts how you are using Gonsiorek.  It is a second hand reference from 1991 that we can't see the full text.  I have read Haldeman's stuff and I don't think your summary of Gonsiorek's interpretation of Haldeman's work is accurate.  I find it highly irrational that somehow you have been able to convince yourself that 2nd hand material from 18 years ago should have more weight than APA stuff.  I highly doubt Haldeman listed sex as a form of conversion therapy. Maybe we could take this to mediation.  All parties must agree to mediation.  Would you agree to mediation? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 22:55, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::You admit that you &quot;can't see the full text&quot; of Haldeman - in that case, you're in no position to complain that I am misinterpreting him. Do some research and actually look up the source if you want to make such a complaint. Haldeman explains that ex-gay ministries are unprofessional and unethical, and it gives sexual abuse and exploitaton as one specific example of such lack of professionalism and ethics. So it is relevant, and the information about this should be expanded, to give the details of the abuse that occured. It doesn't matter that the source is from 1991, unless there are other reliable sources that deal with ex-gay ministries as conversion therapy that take a different view, something you have provided no evidence of. I don't even know what you're trying to say by saying that it's &quot;second hand.&quot; BG 23:03, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::Hmm, I think I see the problem here. You don't know what you're talking about. The source I'm using is Haldeman's essay from Gonsiorek's 1991 book. It has nothing to do with &quot;Gonsiorek's interpretation of Haldeman's work&quot; (is that why you think it's &quot;second-hand&quot;?) - it actually presents Haldeman's view directly, as you'd know if you had &quot;read Haldeman's stuff.&quot; Like I say, you need to look up the sources and see what they actually say. BG 23:06, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:::I did misinterpret.  I didn't realize it was a book.  I've read his more recent stuff, like [http://www.drdoughaldeman.com/doc/GayRightsPatientRights.pdf this].  So this book from 18 years ago from which you have decided to base this article regardless of all the opposition, does it specifically mention that counselors have sex with clients was a form of conversion therapy, or do you just think anything in an article that relates ex-gay groups to conversion therapy is up for grabs? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:16, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::::It was probably Gonsiorek's book that introduced the term &quot;conversion therapy&quot; into the literature in the first place. As such, it's the ideal source to start with. I'm not trying to base the entire article on that one source, but it is the first source I'm using for the descriptions of the various methods of conversion therapy. By all means, mention other sources too, if there's anything appropriate. Haldeman is clear that sexual exploitation is one of the risks involved in ex-gay treatment - that's why the information should be there. In my view, that information should be expanded, to include the details of the abuse - the nude massage and mutual masturbation, in the case of the former head of Quest Ministries. Wikipedia is not censored. BG 23:36, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::::Actually Haldeman does seem to indicate that sex was practiced as a kind of conversion therapy - see pages 156 and 157 of Gonsiorek. The information should be there in any case, as such abuse is a risk of conversion therapy whether it's a specific form of conversion therapy or not. We have to document the risks. BG 23:39, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

::::: Haldeman's early work is the most frequently cited on CT, so despite its longevity it deserves as much (if not more) attention than any other. There is no getting away from that. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:44, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:::::: That's exactly right. The argument that Haldeman's original criticism of conversion therapy is out of date because it was done 18 years ago is the reverse of the truth - rather, Haldeman's work has made conversion therapy out of date, and its validity stands. If more criticisms of these methods of conversion therapy have not been made, that will be because Haldeman did it convincingly 18 years ago and later writers saw no reason to go over the same ground again. Joshuajohanson's objections to adding this content have been incoherent and irrelevant; I'm simply going to ignore him and add it to the article if he can't come up with something better soon. BG 20:31, 20 September 2009 (UTC)

== NARTH Quotation ==

Hyper3 is continuing to support the inclusion of a pointless and stupidly-chosen quotation from NARTH's website in the lead, on the basis that it describes what &quot;reparative therapists think they are doing.&quot; In fact, the article the quotation comes from does not even mention reparative therapists or reparative therapy, specifically, so the rationale for its inclusion is worthless. 

The context of the quotation is this:

&quot;In response to a follow-up question by Dr. Nicolosi about the lack of clarity in APA's statements and positions, Dr. Koocher clearly emphasized that providing psychological care to those distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions was well within APA's Code of Ethics, and he invited Dr. Nicolosi to submit his recommendations for further clarifications to APA.&quot;

So the quotation actually represents ''Koocher's'' position, not NARTH's, or those of reparative therapists in general. There's no indication that Koocher is a reparative therapist. The quotation therefore must be removed, since, it an addition to being pointless (since the lead already explains that NARTH advocates &quot;secular forms of conversion therapy&quot;, which Hyper3 doesn't seem to realize is the same thing as supporting &quot;psychological care to those distressed by unwanted homosexual attractions&quot;), it distorts and misrepresents its source. BG 22:11, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

To reply to Hyper3's claim that the quotation shouldn't be removed without consensus: you added it without consensus. BG 22:52, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

:You added the ex-gay stuff without consensus, but that doesn't seem to bother you one bit. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:17, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

If we are going to apply the &quot;consensus&quot; argument, I think it should be applied equally throughout this article.

::::: What expertise do you claim in labelling the &quot;stupid and pointless?&quot; I think the phrase is both apt and helpful, to express what some reparist therapists think they are doing. Koocher is a past president of the APA, and his use of the phrase (that reparative therapists use) shows it is a phrase used in the debate to represent that position. Perhaps you think Koocher is stupid and pointless in his choice of words, and not me. Assuming good faith, I must choose to believe that this is so.

:::::: What expertise do I claim? None. I'm simply using my own intelligence and good judgment, as any editor is supposed to do. What expertise do you claim, Hyper3? I'm glad you realize that Koocher is a past president of the APA, not a reparative therapist. Your statment that his phrase is one &quot;that reparative therapists use&quot; is wrong. One organization quoting Koocher on one occasion does not make it phrase that &quot;therapists&quot; (in the plural) use. One single mention of that phrase by one organization on one occasion does not show that &quot;it is a phrase used in the debate to represent that position.&quot; If it did, then I suppose the same could be said of dozens of other things that have been said over the years, which would have as much or as little right to be here as that particular comment. Hence, as I said, the quotation is stupid and pointless - because it seems to have been chosen on a completely arbitrary basis. BG 08:59, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I note your absolute failure to respond to my point that quoting a comment by Koocher to represent NARTH's view effectively misrepresents it as NARTH's official position or self-description, when it is no such thing.

== Synthesis ==

Hyper3 has made another attempt to wipe criticism of ex-gay treatment from this article, this time using the edit summary, &quot;should not be an attack page (section) constructed by synthesising opposition without proper reference to practitioners.&quot; This appears to be a claim that the contents of the section violate [[WP:SYNTH]]. They do not. Synthesis is what something is called when it uses a combination of different sources to try to prove something that no one of the sources proves taken by itself. That isn't the case here; everything in that section is sourced to one source (Haldeman), and it represents that source properly and without distortion. I suggest Hyper3 review the policy, rather than continue to make edits that it does not remotely justify. As for the non-representation of practitioners of ex-gay treatment: if they do not regard what they do as conversion therapy, and if they have not published in reliable sources, then it is perfectly appropriate to exclude what they say about themselves from that section. Describing ex-gay practice only from its opponents is the right thing to do if they happen to have produced the only reliable sources, which is probably the case. BG 09:15, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

(Just to clarify - the section does use several sources, but all of the ''criticism'' in it is from one source, so that part obviously doesn't involve synthesis.) BG 17:29, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

:::Although the criticism in that section isn't a form of synthesis, I think the opening sentence, which explains that some sources regard ex-gay ministries as conversion therapy and some don't, probably is. I'm going to work on a different way of explaining this that tries to avoid the problem. BG 23:55, 21 September 2009 (UTC)
== Moving forward with the article ==

The two parts of the article I want to focus on improving at the moment are the lead and the theories and techniques section. The lead needs some fine-tuning. I would suggest, &quot;Conversion therapy has been criticized by many [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights]] organizations and the medical community, but is supported by some [[conservative Christian]] political and social lobbying groups and the [[ex-gay]] movement&quot; as an alternative to, &quot;Conversion therapy has been criticized by many [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights]] organizations, and all relevant professional associations.  It is mainly supported by [[conservative Christian]] political and social lobbying groups and by the [[ex-gay]] movement.&quot; I'm starting to wonder whether this material is necessary for the article in any form, since it seems somewhat repetitive; there's another statement in a later paragraph about criticism of conversion therapy from mainstream organizations, and my view would be that this needs be stated only once. The part about conservative Christians repeats the part about conservative religious organizations; again, I think we need to state that only once.

(The statement in the lead that &quot;The most high-profile contemporary advocates of conversion therapy tend to be conservative religious organizations&quot;, does not accurately reflect the source used, Kenji Yoshino's &quot;Covering&quot;, which states that, &quot;In part because of this trend in the mental health profession, the most high-profile contemporary purveyors of conversion therapy tend to be religious organizations. These include fundamentalist Christian groups such as Homosexuals Anonymous, Metanoia Ministries, Love in Action, Exodus International, and EXIT of Melodyland.&quot; Yoshino does ''not'' say conservative religious organizations, and he places an emphasis on fundamentalist Christian groups that seems to have been censored out of the lead),

The lead also mentions &quot;fantasy modification&quot; as a form of conversion therapy, though the source used (Haldeman) does not discuss fantasy modification as a separate method but only as one technique of sex therapy. I pointed out that problem before, but got some evasive and unhelpful reactions. I'm simply going to go ahead and change this if there are no relevant objections.

The theories and techniques section needs to have the Bioenergetics removed, since it's synthesis. I think it would be helpful to expand it through my sandbox material here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/Sandbox]; here again, I proposed this before, but there were no relevant objections. I will be inclined to simply make the addition to the article if there are no relevant objections. BG 01:14, 22 September 2009 (UTC)
:Yoshino is wrong to limit the scope of support for conversion therapy (in its widest definition) to fundamentalists. Conservative Christianity is much more accurate. (Fundamentalism doesn't exist in the same way outside America, where Pentecostalism is the more prevalent form of Evangelicalism.) I understand that the test is verifiability, not truth, so we need to source this properly. I suggest that in the lead this does not need to be footnoted, but it should be found latter on in the article. My only concern is that someone will cry &quot;synthesis&quot; just because we are using two sources. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 07:54, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

== Sexual Orientation Change Efforts ==

Much of the controversy stems trying to include information about efforts to change sexual orientation, which isn't necessarily conversion therapy, such as the ex-gay section, aesthetic realism, and information from the most recent APA report.  If this page is meant to exclusively discuss things that have specifically been classified as conversion therapy, then it would make sense to have a more general page which would include all efforts to change sexual orientation.  I was thinking about naming the page [[Sexual orientation change efforts]], following the way that the most recent APA report referred to it, but I am open to suggestions.  I was thinking it could be the main page for the category Changing Sexuality. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 16:22, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

::[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/resolution-resp.html] Again, that specific term is only a suggestion. It is the concept that needs a page.

I am skeptical about whether a new article would be a good idea. Sexual orientation change efforts is a term that seems to have been introduced only recently, and we don't know whether it will be widely used in future, or whether it will be only used for one or two reports. If it turns out to be the latter, then creating a new article about it (it's currently a redirect to this article), would probably be a mistake; it may be better to wait to see if it comes into widespread use first. In any case, I wouldn't feel confident in working on such an article until I'm sure how [[WP:NOR]] applies here. BG 23:30, 14 September 2009 (UTC)
: This is a good point, and given the coverage already under this article, [[Homosexuality]], [[Homosexuality and psychology]] and [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]], with the same overlaps, repetitions, and potential for POVs and [[WP:SOAP]]boxing would this genuinely be a different article, or a fork? [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:38, 14 September 2009 (UTC)
:: Those are good questions. The situation we really want to avoid is one where SOCE doesn't come into widespread use in future, but a large amount of information is concentrated into a Wikipedia article about it. BG 23:43, 14 September 2009 (UTC)
::: It will genuinely be a different article, not a fork. None of those articles that you mentioned discuss [[aversion therapy]], [[lobotomy]]/[[leucotomy]], [[narcotherapy]], [[electro-convulsive therapy]], [[rubber band]]s round the wrist, etc., experimental treatments under National Socialism, [[hormone therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[surgical castration]] and [[chemical castration]] etc. I am hoping that by having one main article, we can cut down on some of the overlaps. Why do you think creating a new article would be a mistake? The concept certainly exists. It is not original research because there are several places that refer to SOCE. If in the future another term is used, and we decide to go with that term, we would just redirect to the new article. The content is what needs to be written, and Born Gay has been very adamant that this is not the place to discuss all SOCE. SOCE currently redirects here. If this is not the place to discuss SOCE, then there should be a page to discuss SOCE. If we shouldn't discuss SOCE here, and you are skeptical about discussing it on a new page, where should it be discussed? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:52, 14 September 2009 (UTC)
: I suppose what I am concerned about is that this is a neologism, and while we should reflect existing usage, we should not be a party to promoting new terminology.  That aside, I am all in favour of having an article which documents the history of trying to change people's sexuality, and which includes contemporary efforts in that context.  The APA itself is unclear about what it means by SOCE - so when it dismisses the value of most recent research into SOCE (which would be ex-gay and conversion therapy surveys), it falls back on the earlier research (which would be looking at SOCE that predate these (presumably things like psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, behavioural modification, aversion therapy, etc.) - but I'd be skeptical about pinning that down specifically.  That is why I suggest an overview that includes all the quackery that medical professionals have come up with to try and treat homosexuality - but that would not be called SOCE.  It would be called something else. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:23, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

::What would you call it? To me sexual orientation change efforts clearly include all efforts to change sexual orientation. It is a self-defining term. There is already a page on [[Sexual orientation change efforts]], and that incorrectly redirects to here. We won't be creating a page. If you don't want to develop the page on SOCE, where do you want to develop all the sexual orientation change efforts? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 00:30, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

You know that it doesn't matter what you or I would call it, but what sources call it.  I have reviewed the recent APA 'Therapeutic Responses', specifically pages 21-22, and they do seem to use SOCE to refer back to the earliest attempts, through psychoanalysis, past affirmation and depathologisation, to the present, and they state:

* In this report, we use the term sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) to describe a method that aims to change a same-sex sexual orientation (e.g., behavioral techniques, psychoanalytic techniques, medical approaches, religious and spiritual approaches) to heterosexual, regardless of whether mental health professionals or lay individuals (including religious professionals, religious leaders, social groups, and other lay networks, such as self-help groups) are involved.

That is defined for the purpose of the report, but it seems to cover everything.  If we were to base the article on this alone (as it is defined for that report, not as a general definition beyond the report) then I think we ought to do an RfC to Society, and notify the Sexology/Sexuality project specifically, to get feedback first, so that it doesn't end up referred for deletion for some reason at some later date.  But I'm happy to go with this, as long as you reduce the material placed elsewhere and concentrate it in the new article, and provide summaries instead in the other articles, with links to the new article.  So, for example, this article would be linked to from within a section SOCE with summary, and have a link back from here under 'see also' - while [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] would have a link to the relevant section of SOCE under Professional treatment (which should be separated into affirmative, contemporary SOCE, and sexual-identity change), and a summary of SOCE under a subsection 'SOCE'.  Similar for the other articles which are affected.  If you do this, I will keep an eye on it to ensure it is NPOV and I will criticise and contribute as and when I am able. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:08, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

:To reply to Joshuajohanson: SOCE being a redirect to this page is appropriate. Most people searching for SOCE will be looking for information about conversion therapy. The term &quot;SOCE&quot; has been used so far in only one report, and maybe a few articles in Discover or other magazines that refer to it. As Mish says, we don't want to be promoting new terminology, we have to see whether it becomes standard or not. The limited material specifically on SOCE that exists so far gives editors little guidance in deciding what sorts of material would be appropriate in an article about it, and that's a serious problem when it's not fully clear how content policies like [[WP:NOR]] apply even to this article. We can't take it for granted that if SOCE doesn't become the standard term, a different term will become accepted for all change methods. Creating a new article that encompasses all attempted methods of change could prove to be a mistake for many reasons, one of which is that the task is unmangeably large and complex. Whether it would be a good idea or not is arguably off-topic for this page. BG 03:54, 15 September 2009 (UTC)
::Its not off topic. BG wants to restrict the scope of this article. I get his point, but don't necessarily agree. There needs to be a place for material that falls outside the scope of the article if it is defined narrowly. The suggestion would help resolve a dispute on this page. Lets not start restricting the scope of the talk page too!!! Suggest a better title if you have a better idea. Otherwise I think we should go with SOCE.

== Issues for the Medial Cabal ==

Here are several issues which we have debated and have not come to a conclusion on.
:'''Ex-gay section''' Most sources do not identify ex-gay ministries as a form of conversion therapy.  BG found one source that did, which was very negative.  He insists that his source is the only source that can be used because it is the only one that specifically refers to it as conversion therapy.  I think that either the ex-gay ministries should be discussed or they should not.  If they are going to be discussed, information from mainstream medical organizations which refer to it as [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] instead of conversion therapy should be able to be used.  My argument is that the concept is the same from both sources, just the two sources use a different name.  The other problem is that BG's source is over 15 years old.  I think it dishonest to the reader to rely so heavily on such an old document and not mention more modern interpretations just because they use a different word for the same concept.
:'''Self-determination''': Every major psychological institution has talked about the client's right to self-determination when talking about conversion therapy.  That is the main reason why it is still legal.  I think this should be discussed, and should be in the lead, yet BG insists it is more important to discuss the effects it has on the gay community at large, rather than those who seek conversion therapy.  I think the focus is off.
:'''Alternative therapies''': I personally am not a fan of conversion therapy.  I think there are many flaws with it.  Almost every time a major psychological institution has spoken on the issue, they say what should be done instead.  They say a counselor should instead discuss with the client the reasons for the change, and help the client reach a solution that would be compatible with their sexual identity and their religious identity, even if that means changing one or another.  It isn't conversion therapy, but it is a related therapy, and is what the institutions talk about.  It is the accepted way to deal with a client in comes in seeking conversion therapy.  I think just spending so much time on why it does not work, and why a client should not seek it out, but not discuss what the client should do instead is misleading.
:'''Conversion therapist perspective''': Conversion therapists still operate under APA licenses.  Many of them publish in APA papers and present research at APA conferences, yet BG says that they are fringe groups, and their views should not be presented here, even though this is about conversino therapy.
:'''Worldwide view''' This focuses mainly in the US and Europe.  India practices conversion therapy, under the WHO diagnosis of [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]].  This article takes the APA view as authoritative, and only mentions the WHO view in passing.  The problem is that WHO does not specifically say what type of therapy can be used to treat ego-dystonic sexual orientation.  I think this can be explained rather than ignored.  China also allows treatment for ego-dystonic sexual orientation.
:'''Antecdotal evidence of cures''' The APA says that antecdotal evidence of cures are counterbalanced by evidence of harm, but this counterbalance is not reflected in the article.  Several reliable media source have documented these antecdotal evidences of cures.
These are just a few starting points that we can discuss with the Medial Cabal. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 16:22, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

:I've been following this Wikipedia article for some time. Are these issues already before the Mediation Cabal? Where is that section of Wikipedia located?

::::::JJ has summed up the problems really well.

:::::::I'd agree that JoshuaJohnson has made a good summary of what this article should be, but my concern is that as someone who went through reparative therapy in a religious setting, I just don't see that acknowledging that strong link between religion and reparative therapy is a bad thing.

All of the back and forth gets confusing to me; I guess too that I'm not too concerned about opposing opinion being found elsewhere on the internet, so if it's missing from this article, that's fine. However, I do think it would be best to clearly state that results of studies about the effectiveness of this therapy technique are mixed at best. The reader should be able to draw their own conclusions.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 16:53, 23 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::::: The positions of professional associations are clear, that the studies are poor, and that they regard it as potentially harmful and having limited success (based on the best available evidence), and only a minority support it. That is important if we are letting people draw their own conclusions. I tend to agree about the religious connection, but that religious imperatives to change sexual orientation stretch beyond conversion therapy, which is presented as a secular therapy, but a therapy that those with religious motives have tried to utilise because faith alone has proven incapable of altering sexual orientation.

(outdent) It seems to me that having such partisan primary and secondary sources makes the job of editing an article even harder. Is it acceptable for the pro-conversion therapy/reparative therapy editors to have criticism by mainstream media and organizations directly next to the descriptions of these therapies and the studies? It seems that has been a problem in the past. How can that problem be overcome with so few sources and so few neutral sources on this subject?--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 19:20, 23 September 2009 (UTC)
:Actually the folks editing here who want to see SOCE better represented have all been arguing for a fuller article. Because the area is so polarised, it will be necessary to present both aspects, with due weight and so on. Mish is not correct when saying that faith alone has proven incapable of altering sexual orientation. Such faith in the ability of social sciences to capture the true picture is touching, however! Different communities use different approaches to problem solving and giving an account of their success. This page does not reflect the variety fully. It certainly does not show respect for different positions. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 20:14, 23 September 2009 (UTC)
::I can understand your position, the trouble is, as I am learning in trying to add references to much less contentious articles than this, it can pretty hard to find support for statements in articles. Even the sources that are found seem to be read differently by the two sides on this issue. Though I have a POV on this topic, I do think it is important that the article:
::1) List all techniques of conversion therapy.
::2) List who supports and who opposes conversion therapy.
::3) List studies. Note which are peer-reviewed. Outline the sample size, results, and any criticisms of the study by either side of the issue.
::Question: I'd be curious if there have been any studies of religious vs. non-religious motivation to undergo conversion therapy. My reason is that the &quot;pro&quot; side of this article would be better served if the religious component is just out there for everyone to see, which is my personal opinion, but I don't know if it is actually supported by sources or not.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 20:49, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

Hyper3 said, &quot;Actually the folks editing here who want to see SOCE better represented have all been arguing for a fuller article.&quot; I'm afraid that what you regard as a fuller article, I see as the article drifting away from its main subject, change methods that have been defined specifically as conversion therapy. The only way the article can be made NPOV is keeping it strictly focused on those methods. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 21:44, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

::Ex-gay ministries have definitely been defined as conversion therapy, so information about them certainly does belong here, provided that it is properly sourced and meets due weight. The stuff that should be excluded, in my view, includes more esoteric change methods like Aesthetic Realism and Bioenergetics, neither of which seems to have been defined as conversion therapy by reliable sources. I believe there has been a passing reference to Aesthetic Realism as conversion therapy in one source, but I still doubt that it should be here; probably doesn't meet due weight.

::: Bowener, I think you mistakenly apply the term partisan.  There are proponents, there are opponents, and there are neutral sources.  The neutral sources are those used in the lead - the APAs etc.  This is the problem, people are approaching the professional associations as if they are opponents, they are not - the opponents are LGBT groups.  The APAs etc. simply find no evidence to commend it - and they should know, because they spent much of the last century trying to change sexual orientation.  It would be as inappropriate to cite LGBT critics as it would Ex-gay proponents, but citing professional associations is not partisan, that is neutral where medical issues are concerned. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:37, 23 September 2009 (UTC)
::::And it would be neutral to correctly portray the APA statements, including the ones supporting self-determination and the benefits of ex-gay groups such as &quot;For instance, participants reported benefits from mutual support groups, both sexual-minority-affirming and ex-gay groups.  These groups counteracted and buffered minority stress, marginalization, and isolation.&quot;  They did not mention having sex with clients as a technique to change sexual orientation. Everything I am arguing can be found in mainstream medical sources. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:51, 23 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::Joshuajohanson's ideas about how to portay the organizations statements about self-determination do not seem correct to me - and notice that he isn't going into details. The new report doesn't discuss ex-gay groups as conversion therapy, so it is not really relevant. Joshuajohanson writes, &quot;They did not mention having sex with clients as a technique to change sexual orientation.&quot; No, but Haldeman did. He is clear that some ex-gay leaders had gay sex with their clients to help them overcome their desire for gay sex. Not a terribly logical approach, of course, but that is what happened.

:::::: The lead needs to be a summary.  So, there is a limit to how much needs to be there.  Yes, the APA's position that trying to change sexual orientation is a waste of time and potentially harmful needs to be there, no, comments about ex-gays doesn't, nor does the support side - it is micro-detail.  That can go elsewhere in the article if necessary, and I don't object to that, as long as it is brief, just as NARTH should not be in the lead, but could go elsewhere (it is partisan).  I don't suppose the DVD 'But I'm a Cheerleader' (1999) [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179116/] can go in anywhere can it? It is great movie and I've not tried to get anything into this article in a long time - it is as on-topic as anything else we've discussed lately.  Maybe a section 'Conversion therapy in popular culture'? [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:23, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::Joshuajohanson, the news reports about the APA statement doesn't seem to support what you are stating. What I got out of the news reports was that conversion therapy is not an approved technique, and should be discouraged. Furthermore, I got that the APA is encouraging therapists to help find accepting religious congregations. I stumbled on this page [http://wisecounsel.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/the-apa-on-identity-therapy-and-conversion-therapy/] which seem to mirror some of the arguments that Joshuajohanson and Hyper3 make about reservations they have with the APA's report. I had a pretty strong reaction to that blog entry, but I think it shows how passionate some proponents are.
:::::I guess the question is, should the article present these views in some format? If it is all criticism of conversion therapy, which seems to be what the mainstream secondary sources confirm, what is to be done?
:::::So, Mish, are you saying that the article should stick with just neutral statements about this topic? Does the APA itself count as a primary or secondary source?--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 01:31, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
:::::: You have raised some interesting points.  The research they had carried out, that would be primary I guess, but their policy statements I'm not so sure.  We could use newspaper reports, as this was heavily reported on, but as you say, they give a very different impression for the one JJ wants to paint.  The guidelines do suggest that this is why secondary sources are preferred, because of the potential for primary sources to be misinterpreted (cherry-picked).  The media reports appear closer to the policy than the research report, and the reliable media sources (national broadsheet) would be more accurate than our interpretations of primary sources.  If the admin who was watching this discussion is still around, maybe he could advise.  I think that you have made a very important point here, and it may be something we have overlooked.  However, I would say that medical articles do tend to refer to medical papers (as do academic articles), and while those could be considered primary sources, they are often the only sources available for  some more obscure topics (You rarely see reports about phenomenology in the media these days, sadly, at least not in English speaking countries).

:::::::I agree that the medical organizations are in general very negative towards conversion therapy, but not as negative as this article portrays.  All I'm trying to do is accurately display what the mainstream medical organizations have said, which I listed out above.  Boweneer, what I quoted was from the APA reports, and is an accurate description of what the report says.  I know you have a point of view, we all do, but I would suggest you read the report for yourself.  That needs to be done in addition to 2nd hand sources, but even the 2nd hand sources that you mention do not reflect what is stated in this article.  Read for example the WSJ report, which ran with the title &quot;A New Therapy on Faith and Sexual Identity:  Psychological Association Revises Treatment Guidelines to Allow Counselors to Help Clients Reject Their Same-Sex Attractions&quot;.  [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124950491516608883.html]  The fact of the matter is that mainstream medical organizations have no problem with people who want to reject their same-sex attractions and provide therapy to help them do so.  Boweneer, if you think I am misrepresenting something, feel free to bring it up.  I believe what I am trying to add is neutral and accurately reflects with mainstream medical viewpoint. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 17:42, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
(outdent) Joshuajohanson, I don't think I will ever agree with you that what you want in the article is a mainstream viewpoint BUT I think it is very important to have in this article. I hope you can see the difference. I feel that proponents are a minority viewpoint, but one that should be reflected in this article. I think it's clear that there ARE counselors/therapists AND individuals who are proponents and find this kind of therapy effective.

In essence, I've come to believe that for some people, this therapy is the right thing for them to do. AGAIN, that is completely POV, just as my other strong feelings about this therapy are. I just feel that like other very controversial topics, feelings are going to be very strong and the editors motivated to edit this article just aren't going to be very neutral. I'm OK with that. We are all passionate about this subject.

I read the article that you linke Joshuajohanson, and it seems pretty benign to me. I hesitate to articulate my thoughts here, but I'll just say that I think the concern for me and other gays is that this sort of &quot;love the gay, hate the sin&quot; approach could lead right back to where we were recently, and empower those we feel are religious to attack us. However, those who want to *not* identify as gay but can accept that they have same-sex attractions are the ones that seem to be caught in the middle here. So I suppose that is why I speak up now after reading the back and forth on the talk page. I don't personally agree with this form of therapy, and I feel that it could be used as a weapon against me, but there are folks on the other side of the debate that could be hurt by *not* acknowledging them.

I hope that makes sense. Again, the trouble is, so much of what I have written is completely POV, doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, and probably isn't supported by any sources.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 19:22, 24 September 2009 (UTC)

:Boweneer - thanks for your sane comments; although you may not welcome agreement from a conservative Christian! The British environment is different to the American situation, especially politically, as British Christians do not have much political power (although if we did, I expect we would make just as much of a mess, unfortunately). Politics (which I read as being a major motivation for your thoughts) should be about making as much space as possible for difference, and pragmatically dealing with conflict. An encyclopaedia should note how different communities approach a given subject, and note the variety of comments and critiques that emerge, both inter-communally and inner-communally. This article will never be useful until all parties agree that the liberal humanist approach is not the level playing field upon which other views play the game, but is in itself a player. Hence the APA is not the final arbiter, but an expression of still another tradition, or mode of inquiry. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 23:02, 24 September 2009 (UTC)

: @ Boweener.  I did try to say some time ago that there needs to be a distinction drawn between the findings of the report, and the APA position statement that accompanied the report.  What the report represents is the findings of the literature review carried out for the APA.  What the position statement represents is the APA's position on what is discussed in the report.  To take the report and present those findings as the APA's views is [[WP:OR]], the position statement represents their views.  This is why you are seeing a discrepancy between the information in the report and the media reports about the APA's position statement.  The media reports, while they may refer to specific findings here and there, focus on the APA's position statement.  That is what we need to focus on, what the media states about the APA's position, and the APA's position itself.  To extrapolate the findings of the report as anything other than a report on the findings of a literature review carried out on behalf of the APA (such as 'the APA says this, that and the other') is [[WP:OR]].  I agree that brief coverage of the report should be included somewhere, but not in the lead, and treated cautiously as is advised for primary sources.  The APA position is less problematic, because that is available as a primary source and as a secondary source through the media.  That is the authoritative position of one the main appropriate professional bodies.

: @ Hyper3.  The APA is one of the arbiters, because this is about professional practice, and they are one of the professional associations who exercise authority in this field.  Unless you can find a similar professional association with the level of authority that the APA has, then that is the authority. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:19, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
::@Mish.  I still think the findings of the report are of use.  So far, BG has been able to block the findings from being used on this page because it isn't specifically about Conversion therapy, block it from being used on Sexual orientation change efforts page, because some report indirectly implies that it might be the same things as conversion therapy, and block it from the [[Homosexuality and psychology]] page because there is already a whole article on the conversion therapy page (which he said you agreed with him on?).  I know you don't like the findings found in the APA report, but can't you see that it is wrong to completely block it from Wikipedia just because you don't like it?  I am willing to work with you if you want, and can work on rephrasing it so that it doesn't appear to be a statement by the APA, but please see reason.  This is an important report and should be allowed on Wikipedia somewhere.  Where do you think it should go? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 23:32, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
::: @ JJ.  First, you should not misrepresent other editors' words or intentions, which does not [[WP:AGF]].  I have no problem with the findings - they are quite clear that there is no evidence whether SOCE works, amongst other things.  However, their significance only relates as evidence that lead to their latest position statement.  Focusing on the findings, because they are a primary source, opens them to misuse.  That is why I said that something brief needs to be said in the article, but not the lead, and not in any detail.  What is important for the lead is drawn from their authoritative position as expressed in the position statement, and reported in secondary sources.  This is spelled out here: [[WP:No original research#Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]].  I am sure that Ex-gay groups can be supportive - and that is great - but it has little to do with CT.  Psychiatric patients can be very supportive to one another (even if only in supporting each others' paranoid fantasies), but it has little to do with how you treat schizophrenia.  I could say that you only want the findings in because you interpret some of them as supporting your POV - but I won't do that.  I don't care whether what it says is true or not; even if people could effect a change in somebody else's sexual orientation, I would not be concerned about that - because I wouldn't see the point.  What is important, though, is how the APA view this - and they don't reckon it is good enough, when they weigh up how many people might change, and how many may be harmed in the process.  You may not like that, but that is what they have said, and they recommend their members not misrepresent this by saying they can change sexual orientation, and that they should avoid it.  They are the authority, and they have made it quite clear (in their position statement) that religious groups have no expertise in psychological matters like these, and that they need to stick with what they do know about, and they accept that what they do may even help gay and lesbian people deal with unwanted homosexual attractions - and if not they might consider changing their religious affiliation.  But, that is nothing to do with conversion therapy. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 00:05, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
::::I still think the findings from the APA task force should be included.  I would prefer them to go on a separate page that dealt with SOCE issues in general, but until that happens I think they should be included here.  I don't disagree with most of what you say, but you need to represent all of what the APA said.  You can't just cherry-pick what you want and exclude the rest.

True, I said I'd revert if you turned it into an article, but on reconsideration, I probably wouldn't do that without a consensus. If you turn it into an article, a sufficient number of other editors will likely realize that that is inappropriate and it will be turned back into a redirect, even if I'm not the one to do the revert. The fact that there is a whole article on conversion therapy is an excellent reason for not including a section on it in Homosexuality and psychology, and I note your absolute failure, and perhaps inability, to respond to that objection.

:: JJ, this won't work if you use rhetorical devices like referring to 'cherry picking' when what I am saying is that the findings of a review are not the same as a position statement.  That you persist in this type of misrepresentation is verging on [[WP:UNCIVIL]], especially when I have said that it needs to be addressed in some way, but not as the position of the APA, but as findings.  On reflection, if this were part of the medicine project (which it could justifiably be, under psychiatry), then it would pass as a secondary source, as it is a review of primary literature.  However, if this became part of medicine, the criteria would become even more stringent that are now, and you might find people arguing that only the authoritative views would be acceptable, and that anything about religious groups and non-mainstream groups excluded completely.  So, the issue is this.  When you talk about what the APA says, you have to stick to the position statement, and when you talk about the task force findings, you say the APA task force found that 'XYZ'. Otherwise you will mislead people into thinking that the APA said XYZ happened, rather than they found that XYZ may have happened - which would be inaccurate and [[WP:OR]], because they state quite clearly their position that they don't believe there is enough evidence for XYZ, and the best evidence there is suggests it doesn't.

== Comments about sourcing ==

Joshuajohanson commented above, &quot;He insists that his source is the only source that can be used because it is the only one that specifically refers to it as conversion therapy.&quot; I think it is preferrable, and involves less risk of original research, to use only sources that specifically identify ex-gay ministries as conversion therapy in this article. That does not mean that I am absolutely opposed to using other kinds of sources as well. It simply means that we need to be very cautious and to think carefully about what we are doing. In the past, I have opposed using the new APA report to source claims about ex-gay ministries here, but I am open to further discussion on this issue. The new APA report does not specifically state that SOCE and conversion therapy are the same thing, but I believe that there is one other statement they've made which does imply that they are the same - I'm currently looking for it. If that is the case, then ''perhaps'' the new APA report should be used to source claims about ex-gay ministries. It's a very complicated issue. BG 22:07, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

To reply to one of Joshuajohanson's other comments: &quot;Every major psychological institution has talked about the client's right to self-determination when talking about conversion therapy. That is the main reason why it is still legal. I think this should be discussed, and should be in the lead...&quot; I believe you are misinterpreting what they say about that. The references to self-determination I've seen are somewhat vague and general. They aren't necessarily statements saying that people have the right to choose conversion therapy, though that is how Joshuajohanson has insisted on presenting them. BG 22:12, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

Incidentally, if the APA have in fact implied that SOCE = conversion therapy, then that's an excellent reason why [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] should '''not''' be turned into an article with a different focus. BG 22:39, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

::::::::::::The APA has implied that SOCE and reparative therapy are the same thing. It's views in reliable sources that matter here, not personal opinions. If the implication is that they are the same, then [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] needs to remain a redirect; it must not be turned into an article. You are mistaken to claim that electric shock therapy has never been considered reparative therapy; it has been considered exactly that, as that term has been used to include all kinds of change therapies. That understanding of the subject might be wrong, but it's not our job as editors to decide that. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 21:50, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

== Bioenergetics should be removed ==

I am going to remove the section on Bioenergetics from theories and techniques, because it appears to be original research. We have sources saying Cohen practices Bioenergetics, we have sources saying Cohen practices conversion therapy, but no sources saying that Bioenergetics = conversion therapy. It needs to be removed under [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], unless there are appropriate sources that explicitly spell out that Bioenergetics = conversion therapy. Cohen should be mentioned somewhere in the article, but it would be better to put the material about him into a media debate section. BG 22:55, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

:::There are several sources, but so far as I know none saying directly that Bioenergetics is a kind of conversion therapy.

:::::::::Material on Bioenergetics should go into articles about Bioenergetics.

== SOCE page is live!!! ==

I have pushed the SOCE page live.  One of the problems that we were encountering on this page was whether this needed to include all the information on efforts to change sexual orientation (based off an implication by the APA), or if it could focus on the methods specifically identified as CT.  Now that we have a page for general SOCE, it frees up this page to specifically talk about methods specifically identified as CT.  I removed the bioenergetics section, and there are some other changes I think should be made:
*I think SOCE should be mentioned in the lead.
*There needs to be some consistency as far as medical sources.  Many sources simply refer to SOCE, and not specifically to CT.  Since CT is still a type of SOCE, should these sources be summarized on this page and allow SOCE to carry most of the information on the medical viewpoint of SOCE, or should only sources that specifically mention SOCE be allowed on here.  Sources that are specifically in question include: The [http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/pediatrics;113/6/1827.pdf American Academy Of Paediatrics], the 1997 guidelines from the APA called[http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]] and of course the new 2009 guidelines from the APA called [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/resolution-resp.html Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts], which has not been included.  I think a summary would be appropriate, since the APA does seem to imply that in some circumstances the two terms are synonymous, and definitely it would seem that CT is a type of therapy used to change sexual orientation. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 17:40, 28 September 2009 (UTC)

:There never should have been any doubt that this page should be restricted to methods that have specifically been described as conversion therapy by reliable sources. Doing otherwise violates [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:NPOV]], and possibly other policies as well. It also makes it impossible to edit the article coherently and keep it to within a reasonable length. This page should be restricted to things that are specifically called Conversion therapy regardless of whether [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] is its own article, which, in my opinion, it should not be. Thank you for finally removing some unjustified content that should have gone a long time ago. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:05, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

With respect to your proposed changes,

*No, SOCE should not be mentioned in the lead. It's possible that we are bending policy by mentioning it in the article at all.

*There is no consistency in the terms sources use, and we must not try to impose it where it does not exist. I'm not aware of more than a handful of sources that specifically refer to SOCE. Since the APA does not explain how the terms are related, your opinion that conversion therapy is a type of SOCE is unfounded speculation, and provides no basis for any changes. It is better to stick to sources that specifically refer to Conversion therapy whenever possible. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:09, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

While we're on the subject of the lead, I've removed the mention of fantasy modification. It isn't a separate type of Conversion therapy according to Haldeman, simply a method of sex therapy. Per [[WP:LEAD]], the lead has to summarize the main points of the article, and fantasy modification being a form of Conversion therapy is never going to be one of them. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:44, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

:I see a great inconsistency in refusing to use the new APA report, which does not specifically refer to CT, while still arguing for using the AAP report, which similarly does not specifically refer to CT.  How can you argue to include the AAP report, but not the APA report?  What is the difference? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 15:09, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

::There's been a misunderstanding here. I honestly don't know what you're talking about, or what you mean by the AAP report. When did I argue for including it? [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 21:24, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

:::In my second bullet point, I listed several documents that referred to efforts to change sexual orientation, but do not mention CT or RT, including the AAP.  Either they should be removed from the text, or it should be made clear that they are discussing SOCE in general, and not specifically CT.  The sources I listed included: The [http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/pediatrics;113/6/1827.pdf American Academy Of Paediatrics], the 1997 guidelines from the APA called [http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]] and of course the new 2009 guidelines from the APA called [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/resolution-resp.html Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts], which has not been included.  Whatever you think we should do with them, I think we should treat them the same way. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:35, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

::::You are correct about the AAP report. The appropriate thing to do would be to remove it; saying that it is discussing SOCE in general rather than Conversion therapy specifically is POV when there is no proof Conversion therapy is one type of SOCE. I am less sure about the 1997 APA guidelines; although they don't specifically refer to Conversion therapy, it does seem to be clearly what they have in mind, and they use a source (Haldeman) who seems to use a very similar term. I'll have to think about it. I'm unsure about the new APA report also. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 21:50, 29 September 2009 (UTC)
== Theories and techniques ==

I've gone ahead and updated the theories and techniques section, without waiting for discussion. I've done this because in my view, now that there seems to be agreement that the article should be mainly based on sources that specifically use the term &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; and that sources that do not should be used instead at [[Sexual orientation change efforts]], it makes no sense not to add a key source (Haldeman) who does use this term. I agree that there are some problems still with the material I'm adding - it could be rewritten, or the style improved. There are also some bugs remain to be fixed; I'll do that in a moment. I cannot see any reasonable argument against the content itself, however. The new material I've added could indeed be written differently and probably in better ways, but it is actually better written than some other parts of the article, notably the history section. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:44, 30 September 2009 (UTC)

Note also that according to [[WP:LEAD]], the lead has to be a summary of the main points of the article. This means that it makes no sense to list what the methods of conversion therapy are according to Douglas Haldeman unless we are also going to describe what he actually says about those methods. So there would be no justification for providing the list of techniques in the lead without also adding the descriptions of the methods in question. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 02:36, 30 September 2009 (UTC)

== Ex-gay section ==

Most of this section should be removed, as it is not therapy, but the opposite. No one would consider this behaviour helpful. The page is about conversion therapy, not abuse. [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 19:20, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:It is about therapy and abuses that have occured in the context of that therapy. It must not be removed. The only ground on which one could remove it would be that no criticism of conversion therapy, the harms it causes or the abuses it may involve, should appear here. That is not an acceptable position. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 20:08, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

::Could we include statements from ex-gay groups that they do not offer therapy? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:21, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:::The ex-gay ministry section isn't about individual ex-gay groups. It's about the phenomenon as a whole. So no, statements from individual ex-gay groups probably don't belong there. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 00:15, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

== Haldeman quotation ==

Joshuajohanson has [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=317123158&amp;oldid=317028118 altered] the description of Douglas Haldeman's views in the lead so that it now reads, &quot;Psychologist Douglas Haldeman writes that conversion therapy comprises efforts by mental health professionals and pastoral care providers to convert lesbians and gay men to heterosexuality, that techniques include psychoanalysis, group therapy, aversive conditioning involving electric shock or nausea-inducing drugs, sex therapy, reparative therapy, and involvement in ex-gay ministries such as [[Exodus International]], and that claims of its effectiveness are unsupported by empirical evidence, and those who seek conversion therapy must not be discouraged.&quot;

There are several problems with that. That sentence is now too long, and badly written. To follow &quot;and involvement in ex-gay ministries such as [[Exodus International]], and that claims of its effectiveness are unsupported by empirical evidence&quot; with &quot;and those who seek conversion therapy must not be discouraged&quot; is awkward and poor style. To addition of a second &quot;and&quot; makes the sentence non-grammatical. Furthermore, I believe that this misrepresents Haldeman's views by taking them out of context. Haldeman is fundamentally critical of conversion therapy, and believes that it cannot be recommended. The addition made by Joshuajohanson fails to convey that. 

(the context of the quotation added by Joshuajohanson is, &quot;Even with data to prove that all who request a change of sexual orientation are acting out of internalized social pressure, we would be hard-pressed to deny such individuals the treatment or spiritual interventions they seek. In the absence of empirically based conversion therapy models, such treatments are difficult to recommend. Nevertheless, we must respect the choices of all who seek to live life in accordance with their own identities; and if there are those who seek to resolve the conflict between sexual orientation and spirituality with conversion therapy, they must not be discouraged.&quot;) [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 20:12, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:Is that a better reading? [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:32, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

::Yes. I'm not sure that content belongs in the lead at all, but I won't remove it for the moment. Per [[WP:LEAD]], it only belongs in the lead if it reflects content in the article, at the moment, there's nothing there about Haldeman saying that people have the right to choose conversion therapy if that's what they want. It could be added, however, and it would make sense to do that. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:33, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
== Homophobia category ==

Joshuajohanson, you removed the Homophobia category here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=317368613&amp;oldid=317357121]. That was a mistake. Please read what the category page says - the homophobia category is for articles that refer to the topic of homophobia. This article does refer to the topic of homophobia. So, please do not remove the category. You don't have any case for removing it. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:13, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
:What part of this article refers to homophobia?  The word homophobia does not appear in the article, and it is not discussed in any length.  The only connection that I see is the talk about people and organizations who want to prevent LGB people from living their own lives and prevent them from seeking professional help and forcing them to turn to questionable sources that are not overseen by the medical industry.  That is homophobia.  But unless this article specifically relates the two concepts, it doesn't belong in that category. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 17:10, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
::Joshuajohanson, I think historically that sources can show that organizations promoting conversion therapy are homophobic. They tend to be conservatively religious, and find homosexuality sinful and have sometimes promoted violence and discrimination against GLBT people. I don't think the article should avoid the history behind this therapy; a way to force GLBT people to be straight so as to avoid sin. There are many sources such as [http://www.jewsonfirst.org/exgay.aspx][http://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Conversion-Therapy-Clinical-Perspectives/dp/0789019116][http://www.amazon.com/Anything-but-Straight-Unmasking-Scandals/dp/1560234466/ref=pd_sim_b_3/184-2892952-3966924][http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_exod.htm][http://tcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/5/716]. I do support the article stating neutrally why certain people seek these therapies, but the history of this therapy as well as the damage it has done to people should be in the article as well if it is to be accurate.

::In any case, I think that your position as well as Hyper3 represents a newer and more realistic perspective; the trouble is, it only takes a quick Google search to find that the organizations who either promote these organizations and/or this therapy have views that are homophobic even today.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 20:57, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:::It is OR to assume just because someone is conservatively religious they are homophobic. Also, just because some people who support it happen to be homophobic doesn't mean it is homophobic in and of itself.  As I said, not even the strongest advocates support any attempt to &quot;force GLBT people to be straight&quot;, unless you go back to Alan Turing era. Also, transgenderism is a completely different issue.  You know that some transgender people are straight, right?  This only affects GLB people, it does not affect GLBT people. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 21:19, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:::Joshuajohanson, Which is why I have no intention to actually edit this article. This subject is incredibly volatile with very strong partisans on both sides of the issue. I happen to disagree with most of what you have said, and the links I chose above represent what *could* be sourced to use to add to this article, and that was just a quick search on my part. I am trying very hard to understand your views and ideas on the talk pages. Again, I do not want to enter the actual &quot;battlefield,&quot; because my ability to remain neutral is compromised by personal experience.

:::I simply state what my POV is; that the majority of the push for this kind of therapy comes from conservative religions, and previous history shows that from many sources. What you've stated above is your opinion. I respect that. However, this history of homophobia, sin and conservative religion is more recent than Alan Turing, and can even be shown. I think that unless you can accomodate some of what BG and other editors on the opposite side of the argument see, this article is just going to continue to be contentious; and I imagine the SOCE article will end up in the same boat.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 22:17, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

I had assumed that because the article refered specifically to homophobia the category was appropriate. It definitely did refer to homophobia in past versions but that seems to have been removed; I don't know when that happened. I would still request that you not remove the category for the time being, however. The category will become appropriate again as soon as a mention of homophobia is added to the article, which could happen at any time (and probably should). [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 21:53, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:I think it should be removed until the time which the article talks about homophobia.  I would have to see the talk about homophobia, to make sure it passes NPOV.  There are lots of people who like to throw around homophobia about anything.  But that is a discussion for another time.  For now, it should not be in the homophobia category until there is mention of homophobia in the article. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 22:13, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
::No one should be either adding or removing the category at the moment because we are still supposed to be having a mediation.

::Careful review of these studies could be useful to show the link between conversion therapy and homophobia [http://tcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/5/716 Why Do Individuals Seek Conversion Therapy?] [http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=226622078&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine Weighing the Evidence: Empirical Assessment and Ethical Implications of Conversion Therapy][http://tcp.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/32/5/750 Reflections from the Conversion Therapy Battlefield]. Consider also that it can be shown from some studies that there is internalized homophobia in those who seek these kinds of therapies. 

::Again, I think it is important for this article to not just be a description of the positive aspects (like the APA quote that Joshuajohanson has pointed out), but that there have been serious and negative side effects to people pursuing these conversion techniques, as well as a realistic assessment of the religious organizations behind the organizations involved in SOCE and conversion therapy.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Boweneer|contribs]]) 22:29, 2 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Christian fundamentalism ==

Hyper3 has, once again, removed the mention of Christian fundamentalism from the lead [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=317357121&amp;oldid=317355932], giving some totally mistaken reasons. The result of that was to make the lead look vague and stupid, so I reverted him. It's totally absurd for the lead simply to say that Conversion therapy is promoted by &quot;religious organizations&quot; - what the heck does that mean? It could mean anything, and readers would be left to wonder whether we're talking about Buddhists, Unitarian Universalists, or whatever. What Yoshino actually writes is, &quot;In part because of this trend in the mental health profession, the most high-profile contemporary purveyors of conversion therapy tend to be religious organizations. These include fundamentalist Christian groups such as Homosexuals Anonymous, Metanoia Ministries, Love in Action, Exodus International, and EXIT of Melodyland.&quot; So ''obviously'', Yoshino is concerned especially with Christian fundamentalists. Removing this information from the lead is unacceptable. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 01:27, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
:Yoshino is wrong - for example Exodus is not predominantly fundamentalist. Its a technical term and has certain meanings - something you are very keen on. Yoshino is not a theologian, and may not be expected to get things like this right. It makes the lead look foolish to anyone who understands these things. If you really want fundamentalist in, then make a longer list including Evangelical and Catholic. This is a classic moment where editors with different skills make an entry better, where needless squabbling  for control and aggressive micro-management creates obvious error.  [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 06:49, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
::No Hyper3, you're wrong. Yoshino's article is a reliable source. What matters is what he thinks, not what you think. Our goal is verifiability, not truth. You've already stated in past discussions that you know that (eg, in &quot;Moving forward with the article&quot;, above), so it's becoming clear that you are acting in bad faith. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]]
:::I understand your point, but because it is the lead, I think I am still right. Firstly, where in the article is it discussed whether those who are pro-conversion therapy are fundamentalist, Catholic or evangelical? Wherever this occurs, the lead should summarise it. Your quote, which is dead wrong, should not dominate the lead but it should appear in a subsidiary place in the article where it can be discussed by quoting further sources. Do you really want me to add to the lead an argument about the definition of &quot;fundamentalism&quot;? I will if you want...

::::[[WP:VERIFY]] applies everywhere in the article, including the lead. The history section needs to be rewritten as a summary of Yoshino's discussion of the history of conversion therapy, since he is the only appropriate source for that.

::::::Why by a lawyer? Why not a lawyer? You could equally well ask why we should write the history of conversion therapy using an article by a lawyer.

I intend to rewrite the history section of this article using Yoshino as a source, and when that's done, the lead will serve as a proper summary for the article.

== Proposal to rewrite history section ==

The history section of this article suffers from several obvious defects. It is much too long, is poorly organized, and places far too much emphasis on minor details that are of little importance to the subject as a whole. Most of the information in it would be more appropriate to other articles, and it does a poor job of explaining overall trends and developments within the field of conversion therapy, as well as its current situation. It is sourced to numerous sources that do not refer to conversion therapy, and so conflicts with [[WP:NOR]], as well as with the due weight requirement of [[WP:NPOV]]. I therefore propose that it be replaced with the version I've been working on in my sandbox here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Born_Gay/Sandbox]. I will not do this immediately myself, because I am engaged in mediation and have promised not to make further major changes to the article for the time being. [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 05:38, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

(If I rewrite the history section as suggested, I would add a picture of Socarides to the gilded age section. I can't put the picture in my sandbox because it's not a free image and non-free images can't be used in user space). [[user:Born_Gay|BG]] [[user_talk:Born_Gay|talk]] 05:42, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

:You would do better to ask him that directly. I'd like to ask whether unconstructive changes such as that made to the lead recently by Tdinatale can be reverted. Actually, there wasn't 100% agreement how the section should read; I proposed a version slightly different to that suggested by The Wordsmith, so it would be better to wait for further discussion.

== Conversion therapy for pedophile priests ==

The treatment of clerical child abusers has been a source of conflict around the United States and at the [[Saint Luke Institute]]. Clinicians who treat offenders often agree that abusive priests cannot be cured but argue that relapse studies suggest that some offenders do respond well to treatment and, although they are not cured, they are less likely to re-offend. Thus, these clinicians argue not for a cure but for successful treatment.

== Moving on ==

I think the general consensus is that SOCE will be the main article and conversion therapy should focus on the definition given by the
American Psychiatric Association that conversion therapy is &quot;psychiatric treatment...based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation&quot; and that SOCE that do not fall under this category should remain on the SOCE article.  However, it should also be clear that not all sources use this as a definition.  I think the bulk of the political debate, medical statements and so forth should be on the SOCE, and this page should summarize the information and point to the SOCE page.  I am planning to reorganize the page in that fashion. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 22:16, 16 October 2009 (UTC)
== Homophobia ==

There was a previous discussion on homophobia.  It was decided that this category should only be applied if it is discussed in the article, but that changes would wait until after mediation.  Mediation is over, and there has not been any section added that discusses homophobia.  To label this article as homophobia without any reference amounts to OR.  If no one adds a reference with this to homophobia, I will remove the category. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 22:20, 16 October 2009 (UTC)
:Isn't it Wikipedia policy to only put something in a category if sources CLEARLY state it is? I think that previous editors who wanted this categorized as homophobia weren't able to source it properly. Though I dislike this therapy and think it fits in this category, my opinion means diddly-squat in terms of encylopedic content and is highly POV.
:I think that the criticisms of the conversion therapy technique itself and/or the motives of the practitioners is enough, if sourced. A good encyclopedic article IMO should lay out information but not bludgeon people with this kind of opinion.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 23:47, 16 October 2009 (UTC)
:: Homophobia is to be applied not in a way that suggests that the content or subject is homophobic, but that the content or subject relates to homophobia.  Thus, persistent outspoken comments that are seen as promoting or opposing homophobia (as described by originator/s or commentator/s in reliable sources).  If this article discusses homophobia, then it would warrant the category - but that does not imply that the subject is homophobic, simply that it relates to homophobia.  If it doesn't, then there is no reason why the category would be applicable. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 21:33, 20 October 2009 (UTC)
::: I agree. The term is a difficult one to apply. I'm discussing this with Joshuajohanson over on the SOCE talk page. I think it would be best for these articles to clearly state that historically there have been homophobic applications of the therapy (intimidating GLB people into the therapy for example), but they need to be sourced. That seems more effective and accurate than slapping a category on these articles, and better overall for the reader.--[[User:Boweneer|Boweneer]] ([[User talk:Boweneer|talk]]) 22:15, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

== Create a &quot;History of Sexual Orientation Change Efforts&quot; entry ==

I think this entry is too long, and the history section needs to be spun off. Also it needs to be matched up with SOCE so we don't get two history articles, as SOCE is the parent article. Any thoughts? [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 12:06, 21 October 2009 (UTC)
:That sounds good.  I honestly don't know much about the history and my focus has always been on the current situation.  Another thought would be to combine with a more general [[History of homosexuality and psychology]].  Much of the early stuff was general psychology anyhow, and that would free us up to be able to talk about the declassification, which doesn't really have much to do with SOCE.  On the other hand maybe [[History of Sexual Orientation Change Efforts]] would be easier to also include some of the post-declassification developments.  The current history section on SOCE needs major help.  I'm fine with whatever. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 14:56, 21 October 2009 (UTC)

I have NOT taken time to read all the preceeding citations, however, I am familiar with the topic at hand.  I think that the American Psychological Association's recent review of research (that is scientific in method and critiques ALL available literature on conversion/reparative treatments) would be an excellent source.  While some of these studies provided may show a &quot;heterosexual shift&quot; - no one seems to have defined what &quot;counts&quot; as a &quot;shift&quot;.  Much of the conversion/reparative lit determines &quot;success&quot; to be abstaining from same-sex behavior.  Absence of behavior does not result in the cessation of same-sex attraction.  I would encourage carefully defining what &quot;shift&quot; means before stating that so many sources suggest a change in sexual orientation.  The citation for the REPUTALBE, scientific study of conversion/reparative treatments is:  It should also be noted that NARTH recently re-published old findings from articles that failed to employ a scientific method (in hopes of deflecting attention from the APA task-force report can be downloaded from this page:  http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexual-orientation.aspx  ).  Hope this helps - because the available scientific research suggests that human sexuality is set from birth (read Savin-Williams, 2005 book &quot;The New Gay Teenager&quot; for more on the history of this matter).  Also, the American Counseling Association, American Psychiatric Association, and American Psychological Association have pretty much concluded that conversion treatments are harmful (see for example: http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx )
Hope this is helpful for the editors!

== The element of free will ==

It's not clear at first glance whether any conversion therapies are voluntary. I get the chilling impression that &quot;conversion&quot; is something done to people against their will.

Can we not distinguish between conversion therapy &quot;done to&quot; people who are less than fully aware and perfectly willing, and reparative therapy sought out by homosexuals who want to change?

I'm assuming that there are volunteers; but if this is disputed, let's write about the dispute.

I have heard that before the 1970s there was a lot of pressure on homesexuals to change, and I've read several accounts of homosexuals forced to undergo &quot;therapies&quot; such as [[electric shock treatment]]. But I think this might be contrasted with the work of counselors and mental health professionals who treat only volunteers (assuming there are any). 

Anyone else interested in making this distinction with me? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 18:03, 10 December 2009 (UTC)

* A distinction needs to be made between what is entered into freely and what is done forcefully.  Under the mental health model, people could be treated unwillingly.  Once homosexuality was removed from DSM, treatment depended on a desire to change sexual orientation.  However, free will and constraint are not the two exclduive models.  There is also coercion.  People have always, and may well still be, coerced into undergoing treatment.  Sanctions such as exclusion, from a church, from family, from community, from employment, are all coercive.  Thus, somebody can willingly seek treatment, yet not freely choose treatment.  Don't ask me how you can summarise that in a Wiki article, or establish sources for that - but it will be dealt with somewhere (I didn't come up with this out of the blue).  My suggestion would be to work this out in a sandbox, flesh it out and discuss it there, then insert a section on the three approaches.  There is a lot about this in relation to aversion therapy, and other methods that pre-dated the DSM de-pathologisation.

**I've personally tried conversion therapy 'willingly', and failed to change. While I sought treatment because of ecclesiastical pressure (and a personal desire to change), several friends of mine where forced into therapy by their families while they were under age 18. It's a lie to suggest that all people today seek it out themselves as parents can legally force their children to participate in programs.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Arcadious|Arcadious]] ([[User talk:Arcadious|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arcadious|contribs]]) 02:54, 28 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Involuntary vs. voluntary treatment ==

I wonder if enough emphasis has been given on the distinction between involuntary and voluntary treatment. I just finished watching &quot;[[Changeling (film)]]&quot;, which has as a major plot theme the abuse of hospitalization and electroshock for a political purpose (i.e., to stop women from criticizing the police department's effectiveness or making assault charges against individual cops). I hope this isn't swaying my editorial judgment, but merely renewing a proper sense of outrage.

In the past, were homosexual men or women ever committed to mental hospitals and/or subjected to treatments like electric shock, against their will? If so, when did this start; how prevalent was it; when did it end?

Please take this next question at face value: did homosexual people ever '''voluntarily''' accept (or even seek) such treatments?

Apart from physical interventions (&quot;[[aversion therapy]]&quot;?) what sort of &quot;talk therapies&quot; have been tried?

The reason I ask this is that I want to be clear in our writings about therapies which are offered for &quot;people who want to change&quot;, i.e., specifically the ideas and methods of Richard Cohen. What I read and see online indicates frequent misunderstanding or distortion of his (and similar) views. (Or am I the one who misunderstands?)

I think there's a universal '''modern''' agreement that no one should be subjected to any kind of conversion therapy against their will. Advocates on both sides of the &quot;born gay&quot; issue agree that involuntary therapy is not just ineffective, it's '''morally wrong''' (or unethical). 

There's also the issue of whether it's also unethical for a therapist to agree to provide conversion therapy to a volunteer. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 14:36, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

: The answer is probably yes, in the UK at least, in both cases.  There was a paper in the BMJ about these treatments two or three years ago.  There used to be a thin line in mental health care between voluntary and compulsory - as in 'you can either stay voluntarily, or else we will section you'.  Problem is you only really have the testimony of those affected.  These treatments were phased out for homosexuals in the 1970's.  Before the 1970s, things were such that people often found it very difficult to refuse such treatments, and the stresses of living in secrecy could manifest through other mental health issues - depression, alcohol abuse, paranoia.  If you read Eric Berne from those days, he regards paranoia as symptomatic of latent homosexuality. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 16:07, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

::Having recently seen [[I'll Be There (film)]] I know what &quot;sectioned&quot; means. There's a whole human rights issue about people being committed against their will to mental hospitals (or even kept by their family or by family employees somewhere) to change their attitude about (or belief in) something (see [[deprogramming]]). 

::I guess it's a question of what people have a legal right to be or do or think, in their respective countries.

::Is there a lingering sense that, since countless homosexual people were subjected to involuntary and &lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;effective &quot;treatment&quot; (for something that is no longer even considered a [[disorder]]), any attempt to apply psychotherapy with a similar aim would necessarily also be harmful '''even if it were clear''' that a person had voluntarily applied to become a patient?

::Or is it more that there is scientific evidence that volunteers '''cannot''' give up homosexual feelings, no matter what kind of therapy they try? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 18:56, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

:::I'm not clear that the involuntary 'treatment' was effective (as your statement suggests) - in fact the opposite.  That is one of the reasons they were discontinued, because it was not only ineffective, but harmful.  There are hours of testimony of people who endured loveless marriages for many years as a result of these therapies, suicides, and people incapable of ever having an intimate relationship with any other human being subsequently.  That is what we know - we do not know if anybody benefitted, because these testimonies are absent.  The therapists who conducted these 'treatments' did not seem to regard them as effective either, and that is why they stopped doing them (alongside pressure from groups like the GLF).  This is documented in the [[Hall-Carpenter Archives]] oral archives in the British Library, and the books produced from them.

:::It is nearly twenty-five years since I worked in a therapeutic establishment, a rehabilitation unit for IV drug users; the view then was that such therapy only tends to work if entered into voluntarily.  My understanding is that the APA suggests that therapy is a tool to assist those who cannot accept their sexual orientation, and that therapies to change sexual orientation are not known to work.  The scientific/clinical consensus is that sexual orientation cannot be changed through therapy.

:::However, sexual orientation does change through people's lives.  People who are gay most of their adult life become straight, such as the late [[George Melly]]; [[Tom Robinson]] who penned a gay anthem &quot;Glad to be Gay&quot; got married and had a family.  There are numerous accounts of people who become gay later in life, after a period of heterosexuality, although it is usually assumed they were 'in the closet', and 'came out' as gay.  None of this really accounts for bisexuality where some people are attracted to men and women, and at different stages in their lives may be attracted to one more than the other, or simply settle into a relationship with one rather than the other - thereby living either as a straight couple or a gay couple, although being in actuality bisexual.  So, sexual orientation can appear to change, even without therapy, although it may only be an appearance, or simply that tastes change, or a choice is made.

:::What is problematic about therapy to change sexual orientation is that it is predicated on the belief that being gay or lesbian is in some way morally wrong - as such, it is an abuse of psychiatry, because it is using techniques designed to deal with mental health issues in order to treat what is seen as moral sickness rather than a mental health issue.  It has the same status as certain psychiatric treatments used in the former Soviet Union to deal with dissidence.  The position of the APA is clear, there is no reason to treat people who are homosexual, as it is not a psychiatric illness, but there may be reasons for using therapy with people who cannot accept their sexual orientation.

== Scientific factors influencing the APA ==

Could we please get a list of scientific factors which have influenced the APA's changing position on conversion therapy? In particular, which studies have found that homosexuality is immutable? 

I'm also very interested in the results of 'therapy' (other than [[aversion therapy]] which involves punishments, shaming, and violations of confidentiality) on patients, both those who were committed or 'sectioned' (or otherwise pressured into submitting) and those who are clearly and unambiguously volunteers. 
*Is there a difference in the result or effects, between those who were subjected to 'treatment' vs. those who actually sought it out?
*Is there more agreement on the harmful effects on prisoners and people forced into treatment; and more disagreement on the harmful or beneficial effects on those who genuinely volunteer for treatment?
*Do all studies show an utter failure to bring about a change in orientation for those who volunteer for reparative therapy, or are there some peer-reviewed studies which claim a 'significant' success rate?

I'm not advocating one thing or another, although if anyone thinks the fact that I '''met and talked to''' Richard Cohen a few times means I could be unconsciously biased in favor of his ideas, I can bow out. I'm simply saying that the article should describe all viewpoints fairly, which should include giving the '''reasons''' for various decisions and findings in cases where these are public knowledge. I feel that a summary of the arguments and evidence for each side helps the reader to decide for themselves what's what. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 19:21, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

: It strikes me, and I have commented on this before, that this is an article more about the politics of conversion therapy than conversion therapy.  I have worked on this article for a year now, and nowehere have I come across anything that discusses what conversion therapy involves.  For somebody coming to this article for information, they may be able to gauge how some consider it a good thing, but the scientific-medical consensus is that it is a bad thing, but come away having no idea what is actually involved.  It could be administering ECT, or aversion, or other things - but nowehere do we deal with what this sort of therapy involves in the year 2010, the techniques, and so on.  Unless I have missed something... I would have thought this would be the baseline for such an article - and yet I am not aware of any sources that detail what is involved, only that it is a good or bad thing.  One ''imagines'' it has something to do with all the names discussed in the historical section, but I am not aware of anything that connects what Bergler did over fifty years ago with what happens today.  It appears that what is objected to is the 'idea' of conversion therapy, rather than any actual contemporary documented therapeutic practice. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 12:23, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

::Yes, and I'd like to divide the article into two. One section (or page!) could be [[Politics of conversion therapy]] recounting nearly a century of advocacy about ways of &quot;getting&quot; homosexuals to change: who says we ought to, who says we better not, etc. Another section or page could be [[Techniques of conversion therapy]], beginning with the modern techniques that current CT advocates are using (and claiming positive results from).

::Whether we make such a split or not, we must not lose sight of the fact that opposition to conversion therapy is frequently based on the belief that CT is harmful, even on volunteers. Arguments for (or against) this belief generally cite either or both of the following:
::#Statements by major scientific or therapeutic bodies
::#Scientific papers describing studies on volunteers and published in (or rejected by) peer-reviewed journals

::It will be difficult to clarify the reasons for opposition. I've spent dozens of hours reading various books and articles. A lot of these IMHO mix up outdated, involuntary or unproven attempts at CT (such as electric shock, intended to produce aversion; or &quot;praying for them&quot;) with scientific studies on volunteers who participated in talk therapy (with or without hugging or pillow-beating).

== Amount and direction of controversy ==

* These types of therapies have been a source of intense controversy

Are we using the word &quot;controversy&quot; as a synonym for &quot;opposition&quot;? I thought ''controversy'' means a dispute between two sides, as when the USA was split in 2000 over whether to elect Gore or Bush. With the exception of a few obscure advocates, I don't see anyone standing up for conversion therapy. The mainstream is adamantly opposed to it, but a one-sided opposition does not make an &quot;intense controversy&quot;. 

There is no &quot;controversy&quot; in Western academic circles over whether [[The Holocaust]] occurred; the controversy is between the largely Christian and Jewish West (&quot;it did&quot;) and the largely Arab and Muslim Middle East (&quot;it didn't&quot;). There is no controversy over whether smoking cigarettes increases one's risk of getting cancer; the controversy '''was''' in the 1950s and 1960s when the earliest research programs had not yet borne fruit. 

Is there any evidence that an '''intense''' controversy now exists over reparative therapy, conversion therapy or [[SOCE]]? Or is it more a minor matter of [[advocacy]] by a few obscure groups, met with opposition by the mainstream? I'm thinking of scientific disputes like that over [[cold fusion]], which is not an &quot;intense&quot; controversy: the mainstream took a long, hard look at the supposed phenomenon, and when no reputable scientist could duplicate it, the scientific world dismissed it. 

If there is a controversy, then there must be two sides. Let's not violate our undue weight policy by suggesting that the two sides on conversion therapy have an equal following. If the APA, etc., have dismissed CT as unproven and then pretty much forgotten about it then there is no intensity. It is only if there is evidence of an ongoing anti-CT campaign that we could say there is an intense controversy. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 15:56, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

:::I disagree that finding out &quot;how many pro and con articles&quot; would get us anywhere useful. A statement's inclusion in even a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] does not necessarily imply veracity, so it is important to evaluate sources' ''quality'', not just their ''quantity''. The process of steady, incremental improvement to an article is not centred around a majority-rules vote or popularity contest to see who can come up with the greatest number of sources supporting his assertion, but rather on an effort to create an accurate encyclopedia entry. The mainstream is not &quot;ignoring&quot; the issue any more than the mainstream &quot;ignores&quot; the veracity of [[alchemy]] or the technological promise of square wheels or the notion that the sun circles the earth or the idea that disease is caused by an imbalance of bodily humours. Each of these ideas -- just like conversion &quot;therapy&quot; -- is fatally flawed by dint of utter lack of scientific basis. —&lt;span style=&quot;font:bold 11px Arial;display:inline;border:#151B8D 1px solid;background-color:#FFFF00;padding:0 4px 0 4px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Scheinwerfermann|Scheinwerfermann]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Scheinwerfermann|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Scheinwerfermann|C]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;20:01, 7 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

I think there needs to be some editing of this line :
''Mainstream American medical and scientific organizations have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful.[3][7][8]''

Additionally this one :

''Mainstream health organizations in the United States find that conversion therapy is potentially harmful, but that there is no scientifically adequate research demonstrating either its effectiveness or harmfulness.''

Mainstream? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to leave out mainstream? Especially since it is highly unlikely that large swathes of the scientific community would assert a treatment as potentially harmful with out studies to back up that assertion. I think this is a case of some bias seeping into the article and it should be reworded to a more neutral position.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.124.5.91|69.124.5.91]] ([[User talk:69.124.5.91|talk]]) 05:56, 13 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:No, it wouldn't be more appropriate to omit &quot;mainstream&quot;, because it is apposite and accurate. It really, truly is only fringe religionist pseudoscientists and quasidoctors who (mis)represent &quot;conversion therapy&quot; as legitimate and/or effective. You're right that the line in question needed editing, but not for the reason you assert. It needed editing because it did not accurately reflect what the APA source stated. I've addressed that deficiency. Per [[WP:YESPOV]] and [[WP:SPADE]], we do not manufacture artificial &quot;balance&quot; where an issue is really and truly lopsided. —&lt;span style=&quot;font:bold 11px Arial;display:inline;border:#151B8D 1px solid;background-color:#FFFF00;padding:0 4px 0 4px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Scheinwerfermann|Scheinwerfermann]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Scheinwerfermann|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Scheinwerfermann|C]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;07:19, 13 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

{{od}}:While you may not approve of the terms, they do indeed apply, even if the zealot term is not usable in the article.

:*(religious) zealot: ''A person who is fanatical and uncompromising in pursuit of their religious... ideals'' (such as those with religious doctorates pretending to be medical doctors to further &quot;therapy&quot; they are not qualified to perform. You have to remember, since it's something they claim is wrong/curable, it's indicative of them stating it's medical/biological in nature; thus making them unqualified and solely uncompromisingly pursuing their religious beliefs under the guise of &quot;curing&quot; people.)

:*(religionist) pseudoscientists: ''an activity resembling science but based on fallacious assumptions.'' - since they largely are not trained in any field of science (or medicine) by any accredited institution, and do not follow accepted scientific principles, methods and peer reviews, their activities do fit the very definition of pseudoscience. They &quot;create&quot; an end result and then find &quot;facts&quot; that support it, while excluding other true facts they do not like. Since their motivation is religious in nature, the appendage of &quot;religionist&quot; seems rather appropriate. 

:You must remember, Wikipedia isn't about portraying things in a good light - it's about portraying things in a fashion that is supported by [[WP:VALID|valid]] [[WP:VERIFY|verifiable]] [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] in a way that does not give undue weight to [[WP:FRINGE|fringe theories]] (which this most definitely is, as agreed to by virtually every major accredited medical body in the world) and is [[WP:BALANCE|balanced]] with proper (ie: more) weight given to the non-fringe theories and abundance of reliable sources from people/institutions qualified to speak on such matters. It's the same reason articles on [[Hitler]] aren't &quot;nice&quot; to the article subject.

:That's not POV pushing. If it were, we'd have to rewrite articles such as the Flat Earth article to give it equal or larger weight than the &quot;round&quot; earth &quot;theories&quot;, as well as remove everything dismissive from true experts in that area. Reality just is... whether you like it or not. Funny thing, I bet you with effort, I could actually cite those terms - but I do not think it appropriate for the article. Now, for the discussion, that's different, as it's simply a discussion of largely prevalent beliefs of people in the true scientific community.

== Past and present ==

I'd like to change the intro. It says CT &quot;comprises&quot; a whole bunch of things. However, if you read the source, it turns out that the more &quot;cruel&quot; ones were in use (past tense). I wouldn't want the article to give the impression that anyone still uses or advocates these things.

Unless, of course, there is evidence that anyone still uses such cruel methods as &quot;aversive treatments, including the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals, or nausea-inducing drugs, which would be administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli.&quot;

Honestly, I thought that sort of thing went out with &quot;[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]&quot;. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 03:07, 15 January 2012 (UTC)  
  
-- Someone needs to add something regarding conversion therapy for asexuality, which is really this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoactive_sexual_desire_disorder.

== Lead ==

The lead said that conversion therapy is &quot;sometimes called reparative therapy or reorientation therapy&quot;. I have simplified that by removing &quot;reorientation therapy.&quot; My reasoning is that while a variety of different terms are used for conversion therapy, &quot;reparative therapy&quot; seems to be the only one that is in widespread use. So I don't think it is necessary to mention &quot;reorientation therapy&quot; separately in the lead, as that term seems to be seldom used. [[User:Hebradaeum|Hebradaeum]] ([[User talk:Hebradaeum|talk]]) 01:03, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

== Obsolete ==

Due to recent events concerning Spitzer's disavowal and the current opinion of the medical establishment as of 2012, I've added the update tag to the lead and the obsolete medical theory category. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 21:46, 21 May 2012 (UTC)

:I am not sure that I understand how the category applies. Conversion therapy isn't really a &quot;theory&quot;. It's a group of different therapeutic ''practices''; these vary in what they involve, and they don't all reflect a single &quot;theory&quot;. Also, I really don't understand how Spitzer's recent comments are relevant. Conversion therapy was already supposed to be discredited before he made them, wasn't it? Or do you think it only became discredited when he made his disavowal? [[User:Hebradaeum|Hebradaeum]] ([[User talk:Hebradaeum|talk]]) 23:52, 27 May 2012 (UTC)

::I have taken a look at the other articles in the category. They're things like Animal magnetism and Homeopathy, and none of them are comparable to conversion therapy at all, so the category really is very misleading.

[[User:Hebradaeum|Hebradaeum]] ([[User talk:Hebradaeum|talk]]) 23:57, 27 May 2012 (UTC)
:::I disagree. I think the information in the article supports if a category is correct. However it's not a matter if one is there the other isn't, or that the category is precise. Instead I think the categories are whatever is best at the time and as more articles come into a category they divide them into more precise categories.

Stalik added this to the section on reparative therapy: &quot;Some theraupetic approaches of Nicolosi also include usage of pornography.&quot; It is possible that what Stalik's addition asserts is correct. Unfortunately, however, the source Stalik used is a blog posting. Blogs are not considered reliable sources on Wikipedia, with good reason. They have no independent mechanisms for fact-checking and no reputation for general reliability or veracity. This information could go back in if a proper source can be found, but without such a source it must stay out. Suggesting that someone is using pornography in therapy based on a blog posting may violate Wikipedia's BLP policy, and is potentially defamatory.

== Problems with introductory sentence ==

Hi all. I've taken a look at the sources used in this article, and I see some problems. The first sentence of the article reads, &quot;Conversion therapy, sometimes called reparative therapy, is a type of sexual orientation change effort that attempts to change the sexual orientation of a person from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual.&quot; The trouble with that is that the source used ''does not say that''. What it says, in full, is, &quot;For over three decades the consensus of the mental health community has been that homosexuality is not an illness and therefore not in need of a cure. The APA's concern about the position's [sic] espoused by NARTH and so-called conversion therapy is that they are not supported by the science. There is simply no sufficiently scientifically sound evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Our futher concern is that the positions espoused by NARTH and Focus on the Family create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&quot; There is nothing there that says that conversion therapy is sometimes called reparative therapy, that it is a type of sexual orientation change effort, and that it attempts to change the sexual orientation of a person from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual. [[User:Hebradaeum|Hebradaeum]] ([[User talk:Hebradaeum|talk]]) 02:18, 10 September 2012 (UTC)

== Obsolete medical theory ==

I have removed the &quot;obsolete medical theory&quot; category. No references have been provided that state that conversion therapy is specifically an &quot;obsolete medical theory&quot;, so the category was unsupported.

== &quot;pray away the gay&quot; ==

Someone is trying to insert a mention of the fact that conversion therapy is &quot;derided by critics as pray away the gay&quot; in the lead. I'm going to keep on removing that, because Wikipedia is meant to be a serious encyclopedia and not a dumping ground for every random trivial fact that might interest someone. There is quite enough ''scientific'' criticism of conversion therapy in the lead - there's no need for silly, vulgar, and totally ''unscientific'' criticisms of it. [[User:Hebradaeum|Hebradaeum]] ([[User talk:Hebradaeum|talk]])
:It is absolutely NOT trivia. In fact, it is arguably the most common term for this practice. I suspect that a large number of our readers know this as &quot;pray away the gay&quot; and don't actually known that they call it conversion therapy - the reason is because the term conversion therapy says absolutely nothing about what it actually tries to do, so the descriptive (even if insulting) term is better known. When I was trying to find this article, I actually search for &quot;pray the gay away&quot;, and was stuck with a [[Pray the Gay Away?|article on a TV episode that has the title]] (which, by the way, is about conversion therapy). Very common terms like this belong in the lede - it is in no way &quot;trivia&quot;.

== Definition of Conversion therapy ==

The lead of this article states that, &quot; &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; (also known as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;) is pseudo-scientific therapy that aims and purports to change sexual orientation.&quot; This convoluted definition of conversion therapy appears to be the invention of a Wikipedia editor. There are some sources that call conversion therapy pseudo-scientific, some that say it aims to change sexual orientation, some that say it purports to chance sexual orientation, but not one that defines it as &quot;pseudo-scientific therapy that aims and purports to change sexual orientation&quot;. The definition violates basic Wikipedia principles such as WP:NOR (no original research) and WP:SYNTH. It amounts in fact to a form of POV pushing. Since numerous different definitions of conversion therapy exist in reliable sources, the sensible thing to do would be to pick one of them, and drop silly, made-up definitions such as the one currently used in this article.

I can understand why someone might think it was a good idea for Wikipedia to have its very own definition of conversion therapy, but please consider the sort of problems it creates. If you insist that conversion therapy is therapy that &quot;purports&quot; to change sexual orientation, would a therapist who simply claimed that his therapy ''aimed'' at changing sexual orientation but made no claims that it actually ''achieves'' this in practice be practicing conversion therapy or not? Under the current definition used in the article, I suppose the answer to that question would have to be no. Isn't it obvious, then, that the definition is unreasonable and confusing?

:Hebradaeum, this seems like a pretty clear case of [[WP:BLUE]]. We probably have a hundred sources on this article that calls it pseudoscience and a hundred sources they say it attempts to change sexual orientation. This is not a case of original synthesis, this is a short summary of what hundreds of sources say.

::Wrong. Not one single source says that &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; (also known as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;) is pseudo-scientific therapy that aims and purports to change sexual orientation.&quot; A Wikipedia editor made that up. It's POV, and a perfect example of synthesis of different sources. I note that you absolutely ignore my argument about how misleading and unhelpful it is to add &quot;purports&quot; to the definition of conversion therapy.

Looking at the sources, the APA says they are promoted to change sexual orientation. Jeffry Ford says it purports to change it. International Society of Psychiatric and Medical Health Nurses says it's aimed at eliminating homosexual desires. Elizabeth Hish describes it as methods to treat and cure individuals of homosexual proclivities. Douglas Haldeman doesn't cleanly define the term, but makes it clear he's discussion attempts to change sexual orientation. Based only on the sources cited for the first sentence, it's clear that saying the therapy tries to change sexual orientation is strongly backed by sources (what exact wording to use is being discussed below). All of the sources also say that proponents of conversion therapy distort science, and Hish and Haldeman even titled their articles &quot;The Pseudoscience of Conversion Therapy&quot;. So, the sources also strongly support the pseudoscience claim. And that's just the five sources attached to the first sentence. Calling it a pseudoscience that tries to change sexual orientation is not at all original synthesis, since all of these articles say that in slightly different words.

:::: The exact words of the lead are, &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; (also known as &quot;reparative therapy&quot;) is pseudo-scientific therapy that aims and purports to change sexual orientation.&quot; Synthesis? Yes, since no source actually says this. If the APA say &quot;aims&quot; rather than &quot;purports&quot;, that's (presumably) because they're well aware that conversion therapists don't, in fact, always or even generally claim that their therapy actually succeeds in effecting change of someone's sexual orientation. The &quot;purports&quot; part is just plain wrong, even if Jeffrey Ford does say that. You should read Weinrich's review of Nicolosi's book, something you obviously haven't done. As you don't seem to be interested in portraying conversion therapy in a neutral and accurate way, or even in discussing this subject properly, I refuse to discuss anything with you any further.

::::: You're missing the point. Our definition accurately summarizes what those five sources describe. You seem to be implying that we must quote a source exactly. This is inherently ludicrous and has no bearing on any Wikipedia policy or guideline ever written. Could you specifically state what is in our definition that isn't in the sources? Pseudoscience is there - trying the change sexual orientation is there. What are we adding, exactly? Knowing what we're adding that the sources don't say could allow us to refine this definition. [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 02:30, 1 December 2012 (UTC)
:::::: No. Wikipedia's definition, not used anywhere except on Wikipedia, twists the intention of those sources, and misrepresents them (whether deliberately or through simple ignorance is not important). The American Psychological Association's definition - therapy that ''aims'' to change sexual orientation - is clear and precise. It includes no implication that conversion therapists claim that conversion therapy actually is effective, because the APA must know full well that conversion therapists generally are responsible enough to admit that there is no guarantee that their therapy will automatically be effective in any given case. Adding &quot;purports&quot; implies that conversion therapists claim that conversion therapy does actually achieve its goals, which is untrue.

== Purports ==

I've agreed with the removal, but I'd actually prefer rewording to outright removal. I think the way it was worded it could be misread as that CT is actually effective. I have, unfortunately, no ideas at the present time for better verbiage and open the floor to suggestions. FWIW, if consensus is to keep the previous &quot;purports&quot; verbiage, I will not quibble. I do not have that strong an objection to it.

:::It's seriously misleading and inaccurate. Conversion therapists (including [[Joseph Nicolosi]]) are usually careful to say simply that their therapy ''aims'' at changing sexual orientation, and don't guarantee that it will automatically be effective in any given case, which is what &quot;purports&quot; and &quot;claims&quot; both imply. See James Weinrich's review of one of Nicolosi's books: http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3812731?uid=3738776&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101432891121, which covers this usefully. But I'm not going to waste my time arguing this point. The common sense thing to do would be to use the definition employed by the American Psychological Association (&quot;therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation&quot;), which is simple, straightforward, and neutral, but I don't expect to see it happen.

== The missing section ==

This article is missing a big component of conversion therapy - the cultural attitudes and response. No article on [[placenta]] would be complete without mentioning that some parents bury it and plant a tree over it after the baby is born, no article on [[heart]] is complete without mentioning as believed to be a center of emotion, etc. For conversion therapy, there are entire fictional works on it, and this deserves some discussion. Off the top of my head, [[But I'm a Cheerleader]] is a film entirely about conversion therapy, and I've been told that Lady Gaga's Born this Way is in a large part a response to it.

This article has been, and continues to be, blatantly unbalanced and POV--filled with unencyclopedic and pejorative terminology and almost hostile to the subject of the article.  The &quot;pray away the gay&quot; redirect apparently received consensus, but it is absurd.  The very first sentence of the lede uses the word &quot;pseudo-scientific.&quot;  Advocates are described as &quot;fundamentalist&quot; and &quot;right-wing.&quot;  And, most importantly, much of the article is devoted to critical comments made about conversion therapy by individuals and organizations that oppose it, while very little time is spent on the individuals and organizations that practice and support it.  There are more examples, but I will stop there.  I have attempted to tag the article and to make certain changes, but was rapidly reverted.  There is no excuse for any editor who is operating in good faith to try to justify the tone of this article.  It is completely unworthy of the encyclopedia--but the POV-pushers will probably make sure that it stays that way.  Oh well.  I tried.

It is deeply stupid to describe conversion therapy as pseudo-science. Deeply stupid. You would describe something as pseudo-science only if there were no chance of it ever accomplishing its goals - like a perpetual motion machine. There are good reasons in principle, based on the known laws of physics, why it's not possible to build a perpetual motion machine, so it's fair to call it pseudo-science. In contrast, there is no reason in principle why it would necessarily be impossible to develop a method to change sexual orientation. Even if no method to date is effective, that obviously doesn't show that no effective method will ever be possible.

== &quot;Reparative&quot; &quot;Therapy&quot; ==

Instead of a lame edit war over quote marks, let's actually discuss this. Placing a word in quotes to imply ungenuineness is known as [[scare quotes]], for those unaware. In my opinion, any use of scare quotes is editorializing, and we shouldn't do it, even if reliable sources do, but if everyone else disagrees, we can keep them. [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 04:43, 28 December 2012 (UTC)
:I just discussed my view on this [[user talk:Belchfire#Confusion about correct application of BADEMPHASIS?|here]]. To summarize: I believe quotes should be used, with discretion, to identify pseudoscientific and fringe terminology. As discussed with Belchfire, it seems reasonable to do this only when it is plausible that a reader might be confused, and misled to believe that the terminology is recognized as valid in Wikipedia's voice. This interpretation falls within MOS guidelines, but is ultimately left to editorial judgement.

:Yep. The question is, is it called ''reparative therapy'' or ''&quot;reparative&quot; therapy''? And the rather simple answer is that it's called ''reparative therapy'', but sometimes referred to in scare quotes. There are two arguments here, both about objectivity:
:*It is non-neutral to say ''reparative therapy'' without qualifying any &quot;reparation&quot; as false, as this amounts to the encylopedia's endorsing its validity
:*It is non-neutral to say ''&quot;reparative&quot; therapy'', as this amounts to the encyclopedia endorsing its criticism.
:However, the former argument falls, since all we're saying is that ''it's called'' &quot;'reparative' therapy&quot;; we are ''not'' saying that ''it is'' reparative (i.e., that homosexuality is something that needs to be repaired, nor that the therapy is effective in &quot;repairing&quot; the condition). Scare quotes pretty much always indicate an opinion - check out [http://massresistance.org/ this site] for the most pitiful over-use of them, for instance -; using a term, on the other hand, never has to be anything more than using a term, especially if you simply say that that's the name it's given, not that that's ''the right name''.''' —&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;[[User:F&amp;#38;A|Francophonie&lt;font color=&quot;deeppink&quot;&gt;&amp;#38;&lt;/font&gt;Androphilie]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;(''&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;[[User talk:F&amp;#38;A|Je vous invite à me parler]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;'')&lt;/sup&gt; 05:20, 28 December 2012 (UTC)

I think both arguments put above are wrong.  We should not be trying to endorse or oppose support or criticism by the use or non-use of quotes.

May I therefore suggest a slightly different approach.  If the term in question were an entirely non-controversial one would we put it in quotes?  

If 'no' then we should not put 'reparative ' in quotes because to do so would be seem to criticise its usage.  If 'yes' then we should have quotes because to do otherwise would be just be wrong and might seem to suggest support the term's validity.

I think the answer to my question is 'no', if the term were non-controversial we would not use quotes, so we should not use quotes in the article.  If anything else needs to be said it should be said in words rather than punctuation. [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin|talk]]) 11:03, 28 December 2012 (UTC)

* Reparative is in quotes because although therapy is recognized by mental health professionals. &quot;reparative therapy&quot; is not. It is a made up therapy which seeks to repair something which is presumed broken (else it would not need repair) and currently being homosexual is not considered a condition by the authorative bodies in mental health. Those who promote it may '''call''' it reparative, but that's not a recognized mental health term. Ergo, quotes. They aren't &quot;scare quotes&quot; they are quote quotes. Whether or not consensus is to keep or lose the quotes, you need to drop the silliness of calling them scare quotes. We should place &quot;reparative therapy&quot; in quotes instead, to clarify it is the entire phrase which is sometimes called that. To me this would make more sense. Reparative is only a term we need to quote instead of use in Wikipedia's own voice when it is teamed with therapy; neither word on it's own needs to be quoted.

== Overly graphic description in lead, TMI ==

Currently, we find this sentence in the lead:

::''Psychologist Douglas Haldeman writes that conversion therapy comprises efforts by mental health professionals and pastoral care providers to convert lesbians and gay men to heterosexuality by techniques including aversive treatments, such as &quot;the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals,&quot; and &quot;nausea-inducing drugs...administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli,&quot; masturbatory reconditioning, visualization, social skills training, psychoanalytic therapy, and spiritual interventions, such as &quot;prayer and group support and pressure.&quot;''

I have no quibble about the substance of the comment, but it's too much detail for the lead and it's all repeated elsewhere in the article.  Our [[WP:MOSINTRO|style guidelines]] instruct us to ''&quot;Provide an accessible overview&quot;'', and that: ''&quot;The lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article.&quot;''  It seems to me that putting this material in the lead is intended to shock and disturb the reader in an attempt to sway his/her opinion to a particular point of view.

A more compact and more neutral version might go like this:

::''Psychologist Douglas Haldeman writes that conversion therapy techniques include aversive treatments and spiritual interventions.&quot;''

Which covers the main points but leaves the graphic details in the appropriate section.  ► [[User:Belchfire|'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Belch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''']]-[[User_talk:Belchfire|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''TALK'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 17:34, 31 December 2012 (UTC)

:I think the detail should remain in the lead. This is a very lengthy article, and this detail provides a good summary of the range of damaging, pseudo-scientific techniques used by practitioners of conversion therapy. The notion that the details are graphic are really not important since Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTCENSORED|NOTCENSORED]]. Also, we shouldn't remove detail just to give equal weight to the fringe theory that conversion therapy is actually humane, effective and recognized as valid by the scientific community. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 17:56, 31 December 2012 (UTC)

::The problem isn't that the details are graphic; the problem is that piling on graphic details isn't NPOV, and exceeds the need to provide an accessible overview.  Note the addition guidance provided by WP:MOSINTRO: ''&quot;This allows editors to avoid lengthy paragraphs and over-specific descriptions, since greater detail is saved for the body of the article.&quot;''
::Your fringe argument fails ''ab initio''.

:::Thanks for the clarification. I think we have different editorial interpretations of [[WP:MOSINTRO|MOSINTRO]]. Consider this: &quot;The lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that '''it can stand on its own''' as a concise version of the article.&quot;

:::I disagree that the details make the article POV. The details take about a half of a paragraph in an article with 78 paragraphs. Pseudo-science and Fringe [theories] are soul mates. If there are sourced viewpoints that pass [[WP:MEDRS]] and are notable, then I think they can be represented in the article. However, factual detail that clearly describes some of the techniques used in conversion therapy do deserve top billing. Statements like &quot;Conversion therapy...is a range of pseudo-scientific treatments...&quot; and &quot;American medical and scientific organizations have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful&quot;, in the lead, require some supporting detail in the lead.

== '' derided by critics as &quot;pray the gay away&quot;'' ==

'' derided by critics as &quot;pray the gay away&quot;'' seems awfully POV. And this phrase has also, i believe, been reported in mainstream media. Or do all who employ the phrase become critics and are assumed to be deriding? [[User:Insomesia|Insomesia]] ([[User talk:Insomesia|talk]])

:Bad comparison.  Chiropractic never had a scientific foundation from the get-go; Conversion therapy is based in psychotherapy, which is recognized as valid science.  The controversy over conversion therapy mostly stems from the disagreement over the susceptibility of homosexuality to treatment, not over the validity of the entire field of practice, as with chiropractic.  And conversion therapy has political overtones, which muddies the water considerably.  ► [[User:Belchfire|'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Belch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''']]-[[User_talk:Belchfire|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''TALK'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 06:31, 1 January 2013 (UTC)

The definition at the Arb case is &quot;Wikipedia contains articles on pseudoscientific ideas which, while notable, have little or no following in the scientific community, often being so little regarded that there is no serious criticism of them by scientific critics.&quot;   From a review of the article and talk page I see a subject that is both described as having a scientific basis and which has &quot;little or no following in the scientific community&quot;, I do not see the &quot;often being...&quot; clause as limiting.  And as near as I can tell the article uses the term pseudoscience in the lede.  As to the claim that it's &quot;based in psychotherapy&quot;, the article defends any association of the two with a single non-neutral and apparently non-notable source, and note studies which appear to argue against efficacy from the 1950s.  The argument for such a linkage is weak, and independently illogical (To make an analogy, astrology may be &quot;based on astronomy&quot;, but that doesn't make it science.)  These pseudoscience articles are inherently drama-magnets, that this is a political football is not something I'd argue, but in my view, that strengthens, rather than weakens, the case for any otherwise warranted editing restrictions.  While I have not edited this article at any time, I'm still not convinced that I'd be seen as uninvolved enough to act as an admin on this question, and there are tons of other admins, so I'll leave my opinion and move along. --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:42, 1 January 2013 (UTC)


I'd like to point out that, sadly, it's only a psuedoscience topic when we're talking about sexuality conversion therapy. When it comes to gender conversion therapy, there's sadly a noticeable support for it in the psych community, including one of the people cited in this article as being critical of Spitzer, is a strong proponent of conversion therapy for transgender children, who was among one of several people the NGLTF criticised for being given positions influence in the DSM-V taskforce for sexual and gender identity disorders:



{{quote|The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is questioning the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) recent appointments of Kenneth Zucker, Ph.D., to chair the Committee on Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders for the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), and Ray Blanchard, Ph.D., to serve as a committee member. These appointments are raising great concerns within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Zucker has built his reputation on the position that children can be directed away from nonconforming gender expression via therapy, while Blanchard has a long list of articles pathologizing commonplace expressions of sexuality and gender.|National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce|[http://www.ngltf.org/press/releases/PR_052808 May 28, 2008]}}

In actual fact, would it be within the remit of the article to mention gender conversion therapy? It does happen, and there is sizeable controversy that some professionals (especially at CAMH, funny that...) are advocating that and not just sexuality conversion therapy.

Speaking as an academic, I think the word &quot;renounced&quot; is an accurate and entirely reasonable term to use to describe Spitzer's statement.  However, as a Wikipedian, it seems to me that this debate might be ended by avoiding either term in favour of Spitzer's own words.  How about...
:In a 2012 statement, Spitzer described his conclusions regarding the efficacy of conversion therapy as &quot;quite wrong,&quot; stating that his &quot;study [did] not provide evidence, really, that gays can change.&quot;  He added that &quot;that’s quite an admission on my part&quot; and went on to apologize to the gay community for making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy, calling it his only professional regret.

Spitzer now judges those critiques as largely correct.  All, I think better quotes are Spitzer's actual apology from the letter to the editor.

== The Problems here start early ==

I'm two sentences into this article and I already see significant problems. ''For something to be called &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot; it has to have pretensions to a scientific basis in the first place,'' something like, say, [[phrenology]]. Yet here we have something that at the begining of the article is nicknamed &quot;pray the gay away,&quot; linked to fundamentalist Christianity, and thus, it would seem to me, is based on faith rather than on pseudo-science. Of course, when I look down the page I see early examples of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; which seem to have little or nothing to do with religion so the whole thing seems rather a mess.

== Request for comment - Pray the Gay Away ==

{{Archive top |1=Per a request at [[WP:AN/RFC]], the consensus of this RfC is that the phrase &quot;pray the gay away&quot; should be kept in the article but that it should not be boldfaced. -[[User:Nathan Johnson|Nathan Johnson]] ([[User talk:Nathan Johnson|talk]]) 15:29, 17 January 2013 (UTC)}}

The Request for Comment here is simple: Should the term &quot;Pray the gay away&quot; be listed as an alternate name for this therapy in the article - and if so, should it be boldfaced in the first sentence? The term is used a lot, arguably more than the official conversion therapy name, but other editors have objected to it for being slangy and pejorative. [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 21:15, 26 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Weak include''' - This is definitely a tricky issue.  And policy does not give much guidance.  I was able to find this bit: [[WP:POVNAMING]].  This is what I found most relevant, ''&quot;If a name is widely used in reliable sources (particularly those written in English), and is therefore likely to be well recognized by readers, '''it may be used even though some may regard it as biased.'''&quot;''  And then this part, ''&quot;Instead, alternative names should be given ''''due prominence within the article itself, and redirects created as appropriate.'''&quot;''  So the real question is what do the reliable sources say and how prominent is each among them?  For the record, Google searches '''do''' get used in debates about article content, especially with regards to redirects and disambig pages.  Though to be fair, they can be unreliable.  So here's my preliminary research:

::&lt;u&gt;Regarding the redirect&lt;/u&gt;
::*Google search of '''&quot;pray the gay away&quot; &quot;our america&quot;''' produces '''71,500''' results.
::*Google search of '''&quot;pray the gay away&quot; &quot;conversion therapy&quot;''' produces '''255,000''' results.
::This seems clear to me that the redirect [[Pray the gay away]] should point here.

::&lt;u&gt;Regarding the article lead&lt;/u&gt;
::*Google search of '''&quot;conversion therapy&quot; homosexuality''' produces '''307,000''' results.
::*Google search of '''&quot;pray the gay away&quot; homosexuality''' produces '''1,040,000''' results.
::*Google search of '''&quot;reparative therapy&quot; homosexuality''' produces '''236,000''' results.
::This indicates to me that the most used name for this practice is &quot;pray the gay away&quot;.  
:One could argue that the article name itself should be changed based on these results, but keeping with the scientific theme in Wikipedia and within the article, I think it should be fair to include something along the lines of, &quot;or '''pray the gay away''' by critics&quot; within the lead.  Unless contradictory evidence is provided, that is my opinion. [[Special:Contributions/159.1.15.34|159.1.15.34]] ([[User talk:159.1.15.34|talk]]) 20:14, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Include''' as a synonym. I would oppose naming the article 'Pray the gay away', but it should redirect here, as it's a generally recognizable term, and it unmistakably refers to this subject. [[User:FurrySings|FurrySings]] ([[User talk:FurrySings|talk]]) 23:06, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Don't include'''. What a sad, sad comment on Wikipedia that it is even necessary to discuss this subject. Wikipedia is meant to be a serious encyclopedia, not a playground where people can rubbish a therapy that they don't like by using slang, popular culture terms as though they had the same status as terms used in scientific literature. The article is meant to reflect what reliable, scientific sources say about it's subject - and it should use the terms for it they use, which don't include &quot;pray the gay away.&quot; That should be the end of the issue.

::Hebradaeum, while I understand your reaction to including something with such a strong connotation, you have to understand that Wikipedia does not ''exclusively'' use &quot;scientific&quot; sources.  They need only have a &quot;reputation for fact checking&quot;.  Consider the utility of the matter.  When users type in &quot;Pray the gay away&quot;, they're redirected here, and presented with an article that doesn't have any mention of the phrase they actually typed in.  This is unfair to them, so I think it's necessary to include it within the first sentence to confirm that yes, this is the page they're looking for.  It's not really our place to pass judgement on the most common name by excluding it entirely.  Rather than trying to dismiss our good faith efforts, I think it would be more constructive to propose some ways you think we could properly balance the first sentence, once it's included.

*'''Don't Include''' Perhaps the slogan could be reported as used by some when speaking of conversion therapy, but conversion therapy is not advocated on such simple terms. The &quot;therapy&quot; does not have the support of the scientific community but it bases its approach on the interpretation of scientific and psychological principles. Some conversion therapists have done harm to their clients but it is not because they advocated praying for them. Many view homosexual behavior as a choice to be made or not made; not just miraculously solved through prayer. This kind of labeling is trivial and does not represent the advocates for the practice.

*'''Include''' I see this phrase used, at times exclusively, referring to conversion &quot;therapies&quot; which are now under pending legislation in the US to make illegal. They are chiefly tied to extremist religious groups and as such ''pray the gay away'' is an accurate if unintended comical portrayal of proponents' beliefs.

::No, you're absolutely wrong. &quot;Pray away the gay&quot; implies that conversion therapy is the same as prayer, which is not the case - it involves all kinds of things, ranging from sitting on a couch talking about mommy and daddy, to having one's genitals zapped with electricity, that have nothing to do with prayer. So, the term is stupid and inaccurate, there should be no need to discuss whether the term should be added to the lead as a synonym for conversion therapy.

*'''Include - but not in boldface''' -  [from uninvolved editor invited by RfC bot] The phrase &quot;pray away the gay&quot; is apparently widely used, and thus the term should be mentioned in the article.

**It seems very strange to note that conversion therapy is sometimes called &quot;pray away the gay&quot; and then immediately add that that is an incorrect term for it, since conversion therapy includes methods that have nothing to do with prayer.

===This was removed===
When I visited this article, the hatnote was still there but there's no explanation of the term in the article. I agree with previous commentators that while we're not a dictionary, it's inherently confusing  to redirect a non obvious term to an article, and then provide no explanation of the relevance of the article you've redirected the reader to. And I don't think the term is quite obvious enough that it requires no explaination. Although it's been a while, I see no evidence to consensus above has changed. In other words, while I don't necessarily disagree with this editor [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=547686790&amp;oldid=546835165] that there's no reason to mention Christian fundamentalists two times in the LEDE, i do think the removal of the term was wrong and have therefore reintroduced it [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=580874115&amp;oldid=579908154].

== First paragraph of the lead ==

Right now, the lead paragraph is mostly a series of quotes from the American Psychiatric Association. I don't think that reads well. WP:LONGQUOTE says &quot;using too many quotes is incompatible with the encyclopedic writing style.&quot; According to MOS:BEGIN, the first paragraph of the lead should define the topic and establish the context. I think that the lead paragraph should be rewritten to define the topic and establish the context, and that the quotes should be paraphrased and the quotes themselves hidden in the citations in the '|quote=' field. [[User:FurrySings|FurrySings]] ([[User talk:FurrySings|talk]]) 12:55, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
:The only (semi) long quote that I see is this 21 word quote:
::''&quot;while sexual orientation carries no visible badge, a growing scientific consensus accepts that sexual orientation is a characteristic that is immutable&quot;.''
:It could possibly be written in a more concise manner. In my opinion, all of the other quotes are necessary, because there are editors who have argued repeatedly that we are misrepresenting sources. By using short quotes, that argument disappears. I don't believe that the current lead is overly difficult to comprehend, but it could probably use some polish. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 13:21, 13 November 2013 (UTC)

== Sadger, etc ==

I would like to ask MrX what, precisely, he sees as being the significance of Isidor Sadger and Felix Boehm? How exactly do you think information about these obscure figures will be of benefit to readers trying to understand conversion therapy? Despite the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=583452415&amp;oldid=583442584 edit] summary you used, I don't believe that either of them is in any way a &quot;notable&quot; figure for this field. Most literature on conversion therapy doesn't even mention them, so far as I know. I note that you did not restore the material about J. Vinchon, Sacha Nacht, and Daniel Lagache, which I removed earlier this month - why are Sadger and Boehm more worthy of mention than Vinchon, Nacht, or Lagache? [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 07:44, 27 November 2013 (UTC)
:I think discussing those people help our readers understand the history of conversion therapy, and that in turn helps set a context for understanding the contemporary views. Yes, I intentionally did not restore the other three because I agree that their historical roles were minimal. Both Sadger and Boehm (de.wiki) have articles.

== Banning of the practice on minors ==

California and New Jersey have banned conversion therapy for minors. This does not apply to religious institutions. If I remember correctly, they have been upheld, so far.

== Original research ==

I have removed the following passage, as original research:

'Nicolosi's &quot;A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality&quot; clarifies that Haldeman's interpretation of his work, cited above, is inaccurate; Nicolosi explains that some  males are temperamentally more sensitive and esthetically oriented and can never be expected to act in a way that is stereotypically masculine.  As Nicolosi says, &quot;A gender-nonconforming boy CAN be sensitive, kind, social, artistic, gentle--and heterosexual. He can be an artist, an actor, a dancer, a cook, a musician--and a heterosexual. These innate artistic skills are 'who he is,' part of the wonderful range of human abilities.  No one should try to discourage those abilities and traits.&quot;  Nicolosi adds, &quot;With appropriate masculine affirmation and support, however, they can all be developed within the context of normal heterosexual manhood.&quot;'

The citation given was page 48 of Nicolosi's book about preventing homosexuality. I happen to have a copy of that book. I have looked up the passage, and it does not support what appeared in the article. The relevant part of Nicolosi's book reads as follows:

'But make no mistake about this: A gender-nonconforming boy ''can'' be sensitive, kind, social, artistic, gentle - and heterosexual. He can be an artist, an actor, a dancer, a cook, a musician - and a heterosexual. These innate artistic skills are &quot;who he is&quot;, part of the wonderful range of human abilities. No one should try to discourage those abilities and traits. With appropriate masculine affirmation and support, however, they can all be developed within the context of normal heterosexual manhood.'

That passage cannot be used as a criticism of Haldeman. It does not even mention Haldeman, or say anything about Haldeman's interpretation of Nicolosi's work. To use the passage to criticize Haldeman is unacceptable [[WP:NOR|original research]].

You did say, &quot;It's only the lead of the article as a whole that is supposed to summarize the article.&quot; Now, did you mean

A) the section ledes summarize only the sections, but only the article lead should summarize the whole article.

or

B) the section ledes should not summarize anything, (maybe be a transition, or be completely removed or only mention things which can't fit in any subsection), and only the article lead should summarize the article's important details.

'''Conversion therapy''' (also known as '''reparative therapy''') is a range of [[pseudo-scientific]] treatments that [[Sexual orientation change efforts|aim to change sexual orientation]] from [[homosexuality|homosexual]] to [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radford.edu/~ehish/Reparative%20Therapies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://drdoughaldeman.com/doc/Pseudo-Science.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/PS-ReparativeTherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &lt;ref name=&quot;Answers&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/orientation.aspx?item=8 |title=Answers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |accessdate=2008-02-14 |year=2008 |month=February |publisher=American Psychological Association |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion therapy is now condemned scientifically and ethically by many medical and scientific organizations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Psych&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110110120228/http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-10 |title=Position Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies) |accessdate=2007-08-28 |year=2000 |month=May |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |format=PDF}} archived from [http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200001a.aspx the original]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAPA&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf |format=PDF |title=Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation |accessdate=2009-09-24 |first=JM |last=Glassgold | coauthors=et al. |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA)&lt;ref name=&quot;Psych&quot; /&gt;, [[American Counseling Association]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Psych&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACA News&quot; /&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]], and has been a source of controversy in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrescherandZucker&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Drescher|Zucker|2006|pp=126, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Douglas Haldeman writes that conversion therapy comprises efforts by [[mental health]] professionals and [[pastoral care]] providers to convert lesbians and gay men by techniques including [[Aversion therapy|aversive treatments]], such as &quot;the application of electric shock to the hands and/or genitals,&quot; and &quot;nausea-inducing drugs...administered simultaneously with the presentation of homoerotic stimuli,&quot; masturbatory reconditioning, visualization, social skills training, [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic therapy]], and spiritual interventions, such as &quot;prayer and group support and pressure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;haldeman&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldeman|2002|pp=260–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA condemns &quot;psychiatric treatment, such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Psych&quot; /&gt; It also states that political and moral debates over the US society's integration of homosexuals have obscured scientific data about changing sexual orientation &quot;by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Psych&quot; /&gt; In February 23, 2011, the Attorney General of the United States wrote to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, &quot;while sexual orientation carries no visible badge, a growing scientific consensus accepts that sexual orientation is a characteristic that is immutable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMA2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-223.html Letter from the Attorney General of the United States to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, RE: DOMA, 23rd February 2011],&quot;Second, while sexual orientation carries no visible badge, a growing scientific consensus accepts that sexual orientation is a characteristic that is immutable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA notes, &quot;Ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals' sexual orientation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Cianciotto and Sean Cahill (2006). [http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/YouthInTheCrosshairs.pdf Youth in the crosshairs: the third wave of ex-gay activism]. New York: National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Counseling Association further calls on ethical practitioners not to refer patients to practitioners who do. The advancement of conversion therapy may also cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;/&gt;

Psychiatric efforts to convert homosexuals in the US and Germany were mainly a 20th century phenomenon, although intolerance existed before. In 1952, the APA listed homosexuality in the DSM as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] personality disturbance. ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'', a large-scale 1962 study of homosexuality, was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, a study found no difference between homosexual men and heterosexual men in happiness and well-adjusted nature but homosexuality remained in the DSM until May 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=drBejRLWkHkC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=Seventh+printing+of+the+DSM-II&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CfW6guDqQu&amp;sig=aYwaKrudEZsqFrHxd2bOXik9Yk4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yr_aUYKqIse40gGGwYCwCA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Seventh%20printing%20of%20the%20DSM-II&amp;f=false |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health - Rick Mayes, Catherine Bagwell, Jennifer L. Erkulwater - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the highest-profile contemporary advocates of conversion therapy tend to be [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] groups and other right-wing religious organizations &lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshino|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the therapy is derided by critics as &quot;pray the gay away&quot;. The main organization advocating secular forms of conversion therapy is the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), often partnering with religious groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino&quot; /&gt; 

In 2012, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) cautioned against services that purport to &quot;cure&quot; non-heterosexuals, as they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to non-heterosexuals' health and well-being, and noted the global scientific and professional consensus that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition. They further called on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity. They also noted that gay minors have sometimes been forced to attend these &quot;therapies&quot; involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty, sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several [[United Nations]] bodies. The Pan American Health Organization recommended the practices be subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as a violation of the ethical principles of health care and [[human rights]] protected by international and regional agreements.&lt;ref name=PAHO&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Therapies&quot; to change sexual orientation lack medical justification and threaten health|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|accessdate=May 26, 2012}} archived [http://www.webcitation.org/67xKQyixE here].&lt;/ref&gt;

:No, that proposal is no good. There's too much detail there. Bieber's book was certainly influential, but I doubt that there is any point in mentioning it in the lead. Your proposed addition focuses on Bieber's theories about the development of homosexuality, something which is of only secondary importance to an article that is mainly about efforts to alter homosexuality. I realize that the efforts to change homosexuality were justified partly in terms of ideas about its causes, but that connection isn't made explicit in your proposed addition (making the connection clear would require even more text). Evelyn Hooker is again certainly a significant and influential figure, but again, I doubt that it improves the article to mention her in the lead. That Hooker's work made her &quot;hero to many gay men and lesbians&quot; is an important part of her personal story, but it's not of such importance that it belongs in the lead. The best thing for the lead would be to streamline it and cut it back - not to make even more additions.

== Transgender? ==

One thing I'm rather surprised is the lack of discussion, both in the article and on the talk page, about transgender conversion therapy. Looking through the archives, there's only one thread about it ([[Talk:Conversion therapy/Archive 5|here]]), which soon devolved into the COI-infighting by [[User:Jokestress]] and [[User:James Cantor]] that led to ''Sexology'' last year.

That said, there may be space to discuss trans conversion therapy, especially given the controversy regarding [[Kenneth Zucker]]'s use of it and later appointment to DSM 5 working groups. I don't have references to hand at this exact moment in time (although they undoubtedly exist), but I think it would be prudent to have this discussion anyway. '''[[User:Sceptre|Sceptre]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sceptre|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 01:39, 5 January 2014 (UTC)
:There seems to have been an arbitrary decision made by a certain faction that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; has nothing whatever to do with &quot;treatments&quot; to change gender identity or gender expression, only with efforts to change sexual orientation. However, the law is evolving to include gender identity and gender expression as protected categories of discrimination, as well as sexual orientation. Each of the new laws banning conversion therapy for minors includes language protecting gender-variant minors, not only homosexual minors. Despite pedantic issues about the academic status of the phrase &quot;trans conversion therapy&quot; the thing itself is becoming illegal in the US.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.179.14.230|70.179.14.230]] ([[User talk:70.179.14.230|talk]]) 03:12, 8 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:What is &quot;transgender conversion therapy&quot;? Are there sources that discuss it, using that term? [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 06:07, 5 January 2014 (UTC)

::1. There is no such thing as transgender conversion therapy.  There do exist bloggers and trans- activists who make claims, but it does not appear in the professional therapy literature (except as political/activist commentary). The idea is generally intended as an analogy to &quot;conversation therapy&quot; for homosexuality/heterosexuality, but does not exist in reality.  The state of the science is that: (1) Gay men stay gay, and straight men stay straight, no matter what you do.  (2) There have been many attempts—explicit and published in peer reviewed therapy journals—to change gay to straight, and none has met with any reasonable evidence of change.  (3) For transgenderism, however, feelings of being in the wrongly sex'ed body are less stable: Roughly 80% of the pre-pubescent kids stop being transgender by puberty and instead identify as regular (cisgendered) gays/lesbians.  (4) Before permitting sterilization (including castration) etc., Zucker and other therapists first attempt to help the kids be comfortable with their born sex until they are old enough to undergo the surgeries or they know which kids will remain in the 20% minority instead of growing into being gay/lesbian.  Zucker's approach does indeed differ from the &quot;surgery on demand for children&quot; favoured by some activists, but calling it &quot;conversation therapy&quot; (etc.) is the political line, not the encyclopedic description.

::2. I would recommend [[User:Sceptre]] apply great caution in this discussion: Making accusations of COI without evidence violates NPA.  I was (repeatedly) accused of violating COI in the [[WP:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Sexology|Sexology Arbcom]] case, but ArbCom found no such thing. ArbCom did, however, put this and other paraphilia-related topics under discretionary sanctions.  So, again, I would recommend [[User:Sceptre]] apply great caution.

::3.  For anyone reading the Archive that [[User:Sceptre]] linked to, I was writing at that time (2008) as [[User:MarionTheLibrarian]], before I started editing under my real name.  I believe the discussion at that archive (including the input from the other editors) speaks for itself.

California law SB-1172, banning conversion therapy for minors also bans transgender conversion therapy because it includes this text: 

&quot;(b) (1) “Sexual orientation change efforts” means any practices by mental health providers that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.&quot;

Practitioners of transgender conversion therapy do seek to &quot;change behaviors or gender expressions&quot;, and will be prosecuted under SB-1172 if they commit their crime in the state of California.

:1. &quot;Transgender conversion therapy&quot; seems to be a term you invented. It can't be used in the article.
:2. The law you mentioned refers to &quot;[[Sexual orientation change efforts]]&quot;. This isn't the sexual orientation change efforts article. It's [[Conversion therapy]].
:3. Please see [[WP:BLP]], the policy governing how Wikipedia deals with living people. You can't say just anything about a living person on a talk page. I've removed part of your comments, as they accuse a prominent living person of criminal behavior. [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 01:28, 8 March 2014 (UTC)
:4. In addition to all of the above, don't play games on the talk page. You removed my comments without explanation. Don't do that. I had a reason for removing part of your comments (you violated BLP). That doesn't give you a reason to remove my comments.

&quot;Transgender conversion therapy&quot; may not be a term favored by trans reparatist psychologists, but as their practice is now illegal in two US states, they would hardly seem to be in a disinterested position to decide the matter.

The gender conversion treatments of course should be included.  To my knowledge it is the most extreme form of conversion therapy available and the only one which permanently seeks to alter these people's physical bodies.  And there is infact much opposition both to it's effectivness and it's ethical implications. For example Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is in opposition.   http://online.wsj.com/articles/paul-mchugh-transgender-surgery-isnt-the-solution-1402615120

== I think the article is too long and needs a split ==

I think we should have a general, and short article about Conversion therapies, and specific articles that deals with each one of the types of therapies (i.e Repairative\Behavioral\Spiritual etc), [[User:Ben-Natan|Ben-Natan]] ([[User talk:Ben-Natan|talk]]) 04:26, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

:At 88 kb, the article is not too long. I disagree that a split is indicated, as the history, much of the practice, and the reception is common between the several types of therapy. Whatever small differences exist between therapies can be described here.
:If you are trying to help one of the types of therapy rise above the general rejection of the whole field, then you should know such an attempt would be fruitless and useless.

&quot;to convince a transgender person to give up their true gender and identify with their sex assigned at birth.&quot;

I propose a change to:

&quot;to convince a transgender person to give up their true gender identity and identify with their sex assigned at birth.&quot;

Because I think that this might be more precise, as gender identity specifically refers to &quot;A person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender.&quot; (Wikitionary) [[Special:Contributions/173.180.66.26|173.180.66.26]] ([[User talk:173.180.66.26|talk]]) 04:59, 31 December 2014 (UTC)

== Alternative medicine? ==

Should we tell the reader that conversion therapy is considered [[alternative medicine]]? The recent changes to the article introduced that idea in the lead section but it is not supported in the article body. Certainly conversion therapy is discussed in psychiatry as &quot;alternative psychiatry&quot; but I don't think that's synonymous with the larger term &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. 

Equating conversion therapy with alternative medicine can go two ways: people who like alternative medicine for its demonstrable benefit to patients will protest that conversion therapy does not fall under this label. People who think alternative medicine is &quot;medicine that doesn't work&quot; will appreciate the comparison to conversion therapy.

I searched the literature and did not find any kind of main theme of conversion therapy as &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. Instead, I found that conversion therapy is considered alternative psychiatry, as in psychiatry that does not work.

==Reorganization==
I wonder if someone more familiar with a lot of the nuance in this article than me might consider reorganizing some sections to make it clearer which parts refer to conversion therapy for gender identity versus conversion therapy for sexual orientation. For example, the [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf APA's 2009 strong condemnation of conversion therapy] focused on sexual orientation. It strikes me that a complexity of this article is that many of the people doing the therapy view these 2 sides of conversion therapy as one and the same. But the people speaking out against it on the other hand and researching it have to study the effects of this &quot;treatment&quot; on 2 different populations. By lumping both types together in the whole article in becomes difficult to read since 2 related but not identical concepts are presented together.

== Very bad article ==

First of all the article seems to imply that teaching acceptance of gender variance as something that doesn't need to be fixed is the same thing as trying to get someone to unlearn their gender behaviors and become more/less feminine.  Which it is not, it is completely different.   It also leaves out other more common forms of conversion therapy known as sex reassignment where the patient's body is changed to resemble the opposite sex.  Sex and gender are not the same thing.  They don't call it gender reassignment.  Gender reassignment is what you are calling reparative therapy.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.207.136.200|24.207.136.200]] ([[User talk:24.207.136.200|talk]]) 17:49, 16 January 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Recent edits here ==

I am disappointed that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=641004666&amp;oldid=640982132 this] edit was not reverted promptly. It was presumably well-intentioned, but the text it added (&quot;Although psychoanalysts such as Haldeman and Bieber support conversion therapy, their approach is not supported by the broader psychoanalytic community&quot;) was extremely misleading. Douglas Haldeman is not a psychoanalyst, and he is a critic of conversion therapy, not a supporter, making the material added a serious violation of [[WP:BLP|BLP]]. Anyone in doubt on this point should simply read Haldeman's work, for example, his article &quot;Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy for Gay Men and Lesbians: A Scientific Examination&quot; in ''Homosexuality: Research Implications for Public Policy'', or look at his website [http://www.drdoughaldeman.com/ here]. I note that recent edits have also expanded the definition of conversion therapy to, &quot;a range of treatments that aim to change sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual, or to convince a transgender person to give up their gender identity and instead identify with the gender they were assigned at birth&quot;. I understand the reasons for mentioning transgender issues, but this information does need a proper citation. Otherwise, it could be considered [[WP:NOR|original research]] and need to be removed. I would prefer that there be discussion first, but if no one is going to provide an acceptable source stating that attempts to make a transgender person &quot;identify with the gender they were assigned at birth&quot; are conversion therapy I will eventually remove that claim.

== Only controversial in recent years ==

The lede starts out by saying that conversion therepy is controversial and has been critisized in the united states and other countries (which is true). however i think it should say something like &quot;in modern times&quot; or &quot;in the last x decades&quot; because it wasn't critisized heavily until recently, and if we're going to open with the fact that it is critisized we should mention that.

Ben-Natan is quite correct that the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot;, as used by proponents of reparative therapy, does refer to a specific kind of conversion therapy, and is not a synonym for conversion therapy in general. That does not contradict the fact that &quot;reparative therapy&quot; and &quot;conversion therapy&quot; are often used as synonyms by opponents of conversion therapy. Wikipedia is not the place to debate the rights or wrongs of that usage. Removing the mention of &quot;reparative therapy&quot; from the lead is both unhelpful and unjustified.

The bottom line is that if you want the article to say that conversion therapy is a type of SOCE, then you need a source that actually states, in so many words, that conversion therapy is a type of SOCE. Clearly, you do not have such a source. I am familiar with the source you added, and it simply doesn't support the claim you added. You claim above that [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] is the &quot;umbrella&quot; and conversion therapy one of the items that falls under it; that is your personal interpretation only. One could equally well say they are different terms for the same thing. [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 23:27, 23 March 2015 (UTC)

== honking confusing lead ==

the lead goes on at length about how the therapies are bad and condemned by any sensible person - yes, quite right, i assume - but by the end of the lead i have no clue what the fuck these therapies are. Are they voluntary? Coercive? Self-directed? What??? They use medication? how about the article tells us actually about the 'conversion' or 'reparation' process, so people get an actual summary of what it is. the lead of an article is not for listing all the bad things about the issue. even an article on the Holocaust is going to actually outline what the Holocaust was, and then just have one paragraph for evaluation. it wouldn't have one sentence on ''what it is'' then three paragraphs saying how evil it is. i have no clue what gay conversion therapy is about (going to read the article now) or who wrote this article, but take this for what it's worth. [note, i can imagine this is a contested topic so it might have been difficult to get a consensus and stuff, but this is just my unvarnished feedback from a disinterested reader who just wanted to find out about this thing after Pres. obama's announced announcement.] &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:#344444 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em&quot;&gt;[[User:Happy monsoon day|&lt;font color=&quot;Yellow&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Happy&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; '''''monsoon''''' &lt;/font&gt;[[User talk:Happy monsoon day|&lt;font color=&quot;magenta&quot;&gt;''day''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;  00:37, 9 April 2015 (UTC)

== Should not be in pseudoscience category ==

I don't think this article belongs in the pseudoscience category. There are a number of studies such as [http://www.amazon.com/Ex-Gays-Longitudinal-Religiously-Mediated-Orientation/dp/083082846X this one] that find that conversion therapy is often effective. At most, this article belongs in the Medical controversies category. Just because some people don't like conversion therapy, doesn't mean that it's pseudoscience.

::I don't much care whether the pseudoscience category is included or not, but to help discussion, it would be good to state for the record what the sources are that do call conversion therapy a pseudoscience.

[[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 09:30, 15 April 2015 (UTC)

== NPOV dispute ==

The article, as written before my edits, is clearly biased. The article labels supporters of conversion therapy as &quot;fundamentalist&quot; and the article labels conversion therapy as &quot;pseudoscience.&quot;

Such language reflects value judgments about conversion therapy -- these value judgments violate Wikipedia's NPOV policy. If Wikipedia labels conversion therapy as pseudoscience, this shows that Wikipedia has a liberal agenda. 

One of the editors who reverted my edits was [[User:Roscelese]]. On Roscelese's user page, she identifies as an LGBT Wikipedian. Roscelese is clearly biased and not neutral. Also, Roscelese claims I cited a &quot;weak source&quot; in support of the argument that conversion therapy works. The source I cited was the 2007 Jones and Yarhouse study, which was the most extensive study ever done on the results of conversion therapy.

To be consistent with Wikipedia's NPOV policy, conversion therapy should not be listed under the pseudoscience category.[[Special:Contributions/70.128.120.202|70.128.120.202]] ([[User talk:70.128.120.202|talk]]) 22:47, 14 April 2015 (UTC)

I don't know who the authors are but given who the publisher is... this is a really dubious piece of work. And &quot;...followed hundreds of patients of conversion therapy for several years. The study found that, for many of the patients, conversion therapy was successful...&quot; -- if you follow hundreds of test subjects then of course you're going to find &quot;many&quot; for whom the &quot;therapy&quot; was &quot;successful&quot;.

:{{ping|Jeraphine Gryphon}}, you claim that &quot;given who the publisher is... this is a really dubious piece of work.&quot; {{ping|Roscelese}}, you claim that the study is &quot;obviously not from a reliable source.&quot; InterVarsity Press (IVP) is a well-respected publisher. There is no basis for claiming that something is dubious, merely because it was published by IVP. Jeraphine, in your edit summary you indicate that IVP is unreliable because it is an evangelical Christian publisher. Where on WP, can you find anything that says something is not a reliable source '''''simply because it was published by evangelical Christians?''''' It would be a very strange policy for Wikipedia to exclude all sources published by evangelical Christians. WP would be engaging in invidious discrimination if it did not allow citation to sources written by Christians.

== Obama ==

The President of the United States of America recently supported banning conversion therapy for minors. Ben-Natan seems to think this should not be mentioned, and removed the information [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_therapy&amp;diff=655921036&amp;oldid=655911423 here], giving as justification that Obama is not a mental health professional. This has to be the most spurious justification for an edit I've ever come across at this article. The President of the United States taking a stand against conversion therapy is major news, and the article would fail its readers if it did not mention this. It's not relevant at all that Obama himself isn't a mental health professional; what he is doing impacts the profession. [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 08:34, 11 April 2015 (UTC)

This was added to the United States -- Legal Status section. It is beyond absurd to suggest that a White House policy statement about conversion therapy is not relevant to the legal status of conversion therapy in the United States. The Executive branch makes law also, through regulations.(70.179.14.230)

== Critique of the Critique ==
I added a reference to a position paper critical of the American Psychological Association's rejection of reparative therapy in two places: under United States / 21st Century and under Reparative therapy.  This position paper is published by the National Alliance of Professional Psychology Providers, which has apparently focused its efforts on reforming American psychological practices since it was founded.  Because this is a reform association, it's understandable that its positions are considered &quot;debated&quot;.  This is why my additions to this article are written in the form of &quot;xxxx has been critiqued by the NAPPP&quot; rather than saying &quot;xxxx is a bad idea&quot; or &quot;xxxx has been widely critiqued&quot;.[[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 16:01, 4 May 2015 (UTC)

It is generally acceptable to change headings when a better header is appropriate, e.g., one more descriptive of the content of the discussion or the issue discussed, less one-sided, more appropriate for accessibility reasons, etc. To avoid disputes, it is best to discuss a heading change with the editor who started the thread, if possible, when a change is likely to be controversial.&quot; Just to make it 100% clear, I do ''not'' think that there is a good reason to change the section heading in this case.

== &quot;a disease&quot; -who said that? ==

In Yoshino 2002, pages 799 to about 801 (page 31-33 in the viewer) we read that there's a trend in the mental health profession, namely the deletion of homosexuality per se as a disease.  Thus Yoshino says that &quot;In part because of this trend in the mental health profession, the most high-profile contemporary purveyors of conversion therapy tend to be religious organizations&quot; on page 800, and Yoshino writes that &quot;these organizations are relatively insulated from the depathologization of homosexuality, as they are less reliant on a literal disease model to justify their conversion practices&quot; (page 801).

I had added a comment in the lede paragraphs (now undo'd) to reflect this ideological basis for the continuation of conversion therapy by religious organizations.  Doesn't it make sense that professional mental health is primarily concerned with curing diseases, while religious organizations have a different purpose?

== Lobotomy ==

In checking some claims, I came across a few places where lobotomy was mentioned as a procedure used for conversion therapy.  In Germany and the UK, it seems that the documents are a little easier to obtain freely.  Only the article in the Atlantic (referencing the film Changing our Minds by James Harrison) and stories about Evelyn Hooker, including one published by the American Psychological Association, indicate that this was practiced in the US.  [[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 19:08, 8 May 2015 (UTC)

It looks like the lobotomies also appear in Yoshino 2002.  Yoshino chose to focus mostly on the therapies that lasted longer through the 20th century, though.  I'm not sure when the lobotomies stopped; I suppose that before 1973, when homosexuality was a diagnosis for disease, any contemporary psychiatric treatment may have been prescribed for homosexuality, right?  [[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 23:08, 8 May 2015 (UTC)

== What is Reparative Therapy? ==
There is some disagreement as to what '''reparative therapy''' is.  Should it be used as a synonym for '''conversion therapy'''?  Or should it be a type of '''conversion therapy'''?  This is important because the subject of the Texas GOP endorsement is '''reparative''' and not '''conversion''', and for other reasons.

:It is futile to raise this issue. Reparative therapy and conversion therapy are typically used as synonyms in the literature dealing with them. Perhaps that's mistaken, but it frankly doesn't make a difference for Wikipedia's purposes whether it is mistaken or not.

You are free to disagree that the terms should be used as synonyms, but Wikipedia isn't the place to debate this.

:FreeKnowledgeCreator, I included this word in the lede paragraphs to express the term's own ambiguity.  If you look at the paragraph below about reparative therapy, you can see that it has a specific meaning when used in its own context.  If the article fails to make this distinction, then I think the reader will have a poor answer to these questions: Can I get sex therapy if I go in for reparative therapy?

In my opinion, by reviewing the sources that use the words interchangeably, there are a few things in common: 1) Failure to provide a definition for reparative therapy. 2) Distaste for the word reparative therapy, because of the its theoretical implications.  3) Research only relevant to conversion therapy in the post-Stonewall era; not relevant to the era during which psychiatric treatments were provided with various degrees of coercion.  (With the exception of the APA task force report, the 150+ pager with a table in the back saying which therapy was studied when... making the distinction quite clear between the therapies attempted before and after Stonewall).

::::::::::::&quot;33. See Drescher, supra note 2, at 19, 20 (noting that “reparative” therapy is generally defined as “to change an individual’s homosexual orientation to a heterosexual one,” and attributing the coining of the term “reparative” therapy to Joseph Nicolsi[sic] from his book REPARATIVE THERAPY OF THE MALE HOMOSEXUAL: A NEW CLINICAL APPROACH (1991)); see also Leland &amp; Miller, supra note 8, at 49 (asserting that Nicolosi is the foremost expert on “reparative” therapy).&quot;

::::::::::::So this is the first article I've seen that attempts to define the term.

::::::::::::::The history of attempting to change sexual orientation in Western Europe, the US, and (presumably) Australasia includes many many negative things.  This is a good reason for the mental health profession to stop doing it.  But &quot;reparative therapy&quot; as a practice never existed until Nicolosi's book was released in 1991, and there is no evidence in the literature that anybody practicing reparative therapy ever employed the techniques that are described here and elsewhere as &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;torture&quot;, or &quot;lobotomy&quot;.  These techniques do fit, however, within &quot;treatments intended to change a person's sexual orientation&quot;.

::::::::::::::When Wikipedia's article says that reparative therapy is conversion therapy, and that conversion therapy includes aversion therapy, it makes a false statement.  Either reparative therapy is a limited subset of conversion therapy (my personal feeling), or conversion therapy does not include aversion therapy (also defensible).

== Does &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; include aversive / shock treatments? ==

This article currently combines three or more named categories of treatments under the umbrella term &quot;conversion therapy&quot;.  The first is &quot;Conversion therapy&quot;, which is the subject of an ongoing political debate in the US.  The second is &quot;Aversion therapy&quot;, which is the distasteful practice of using electrical shocks, awful smells, or other forms of pain to condition a person's mind away from undesired attractions.  The third is &quot;Reparative therapy&quot; which was described by certain authors as a counseling-based treatment for people who wish to change their sexual orientation.

The way the article currently defines &quot;Conversion therapy&quot;, surgical treatments such as lobotomy and antipsychotic prescriptions are also included.

In discussions with Wikipedia contributors (see above), it has become clear that both aversive treatments and reparative treatments are desired to remain under the definition of conversion therapy.  But from my reading of the sources, only two out of three categories belong.  This is expressed most clearly in the article below:

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH BASE ON SEXUAL REORIENTATION THERAPIES; Journal of Marital and Family Therapy April 2008, Vol. 34, No. 2, 227–238; Julianne M. Serovich, Shonda M. Craft, Paula Toviessi, Rashmi Gangamma, Tiffany McDowell, and Erika L. Grafsky; The Ohio State University, University of Minnesota. URL: http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Documents/Board/j.1752-0606.2008.00065.x.pdf

&quot;Reparative therapy, as a program of psychotherapy, attempts to ‘‘cure’’
homosexuals by transforming them into heterosexuals (Hicks, 1999). These therapies can
include a myriad of techniques including prayer, religious conversion, and individual or group
counseling. In contrast, aversion therapies are techniques which share the same goal but are
behavioral in nature, such as shock therapy. Traditional methods of aversion techniques have
been termed ‘‘cruel’’ (Haldeman, 2002) and would not pass current Institutional Review Board
Standards for acceptable research practices.&quot;

Would Wikipedia contributors and editors please comment on what I perceive to be an inconsistency at best regarding the three named categories?  [[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 13:39, 12 May 2015 (UTC)

:Yes, I will comment. The way in which you have endlessly raised the same issue, despite a lack of support or agreement from any other editor, has developed a considerable nuisance-value. Placing an RfC will achieve nothing; you are very unlikely to find anyone sympathetic to your cause. Above you cite a single article that you believe shows that aversion therapy and reparative therapy are distinct from &quot;conversion therapy&quot;. I consider it to be trivial in comparison to various sources that use &quot;conversion therapy&quot; as a broad term for attempts to change sexual orientation, so I think your references to it achieve nothing.

::Thank you for your comment.  I have cited two articles, the one above and the 2009 APA &quot;Report of the Task Force&quot; by Glassgold et al.  The first article says that reparative therapy is no synonym for conversion therapy; reparative therapy is always only psychoanalytical.  The second article makes a different point, namely that conversion therapy does not include aversion therapy.  In any case, neither article reports that any reparative therapy ever included aversion therapy or the other cruel and damaging methods listed here.  It is wrong to place these methods under the heading &quot;reparative therapy&quot;.  [[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 13:29, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

*'''Of course''' - Although this is a malformed RfC in that it asks editors to answer a question about conversion therapy, rather than a specific article edit, my assessment is that conversion therapy is treated both as an umbrella term encompassing several techniques, as well as a term that is used interchangeable with reparative therapy. The article is about the umbrella term and the myriad of pseudoscience techniques that errantly attempt to change a person's sexual or gender identity.- [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 13:55, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

: This appears to be at least the 3rd or 4th time you're attempting to make a change to the lede. You already asked the question, and there is very clear editor consensus against your version of the lede (and, more notably, for keeping the current version, which is supported by the vast majority of sources). Very importantly, you haven't responded to the concerns that other editors have, but rather have proposed several variations with the same issues. Multiple RFCs have been opened (how I got here) with the same results. I'm happy to [[WP:AGF]], but, frankly, at this point, you're wasting your own and others' time with repeated RFCs. '''Consensus is clear'''. Please stop proposing edits with the same issues. Specifically, based on the consensus I see above, you would have to show that &quot;conversion therapy&quot; does not apply broadly to any kind of treatment with the goal of changing sexual orientation. Your position is supported by a few sources that you're cherry-picking, and the current lede is supported by many, many more sources cited by other editors in the various discussions. Until you can say why those sources are wrong (and the only way to do this on Wikipedia is through other sources, not what '''you''' think the term should mean based on giving undue weight to a few sources), your edits will not be accepted by the community.

As you say, I am attempting to make a change to the lede for the 3rd or 4th time and I'm working on it here in the talk page to enable review before I try to edit.  I am confused by your statement that there is clear editor consensus against my version of the lede.  Without making him out to be my ally, I was encouraged previously by MrX's remark above beginning with &quot;Of course&quot;, dated 13 May.  MrX seems to agree with me that there are two definitions for conversion therapy floating around, one which is a common synonym for &quot;reparative therapy&quot; and the other which describes an entire class of therapies, anything done to attempt to change sexual orientation.  He goes on to say that this article is about the general term.  This would justify removing &quot;reparative&quot; as a synonym from the lede, or as I'm suggesting, to make &quot;reparative&quot; the synonym for another usage of &quot;conversion&quot;.

::This is all important because there is some confusion about terminology, allowing members of the public to mistakenly attribute aversive practices, and in fact surgical procedures like lobotomy and chemical castration, --outrageous acts by clinicians!-- to the clinics of &quot;reparative therapists&quot; (the narrow definition), which is clearly not demonstrable in the literature, as I have labored to show.

::: You haven't shown that there '''are''', in fact, two definitions in common use, only that two sources that you're cherry-picking are using the term more narrowly. The majority of the sources still use the term broadly. If you want the article to be more careful in its use of &quot;reparative therapy&quot; to exclude '''physically''' abusive forms of conversion therapy, you may be able to justify that by the sources. What's not justifiable is the narrowing or skewing of the definition of &quot;conversion therapy&quot; itself, which is very clearly a broad term applicable to both psychological and physical practices. By the way, the scientific consensus is that &quot;reparative therapy&quot; (as narrowly defined by you) is still an outrageous practice with long-lasting psychological and social damage. The ''very first'' source cited in the article addresses this directly, and even, in fact, argues that the term &quot;reparative therapy&quot; shouldn't be used, as it implies that there is something broken. It explicitly rejects the distinction between the two, which is exactly what you're trying to argue. I think you'll find that the prevailing medical and scientific literature holds similar views.

In recent years, however, refugees from such cruel therapies have become less common in this author’s practice as these treatments have fallen into disfavor.'

:1b_comment) The author uses the phrase &quot;some form of conversion therapy&quot; to indicate that there is a wide range of practices under the category.  He does not imply that the &quot;cruel&quot; aversive methods are going on now, or that &quot;reparative therapists&quot; do them.  This does not support the thought that the words are synonyms.

::::Let's walk through the articles you brought up.  The article [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmft.12040/full here], from the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy,  makes &quot;reparative&quot; a synonym to &quot;conversion&quot;, but this is only in the context of counseling.  The paper describes practitioners as &quot;therapists&quot;, &quot;family therapists&quot;, and &quot;counselors&quot; interchangeably; the article doesn't mention electroshock methods or aversion.  Clearly in this context &quot;Conversion therapy&quot; is counseling only.

::::The paper [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&amp;context=aulr here], Hicks 1999 from the American University Law Review, is all about reparative therapy.  She puts the word in quotes to indicate her disagreement with the word's ideological implication.  The abuses described are really serious, and they stem from the well-publicized story of Lyn Duff at Rivendell of Utah.  This is the best example of the not-my point, that &quot;reparative&quot; is used as a generic term.  From the article:

::::'For purposes of this Comment, the form of “reparative” therapy under examination is that type imposed by parents on their minor children in an attempt to change the child’s perceived sexual orientation. To avoid any legal ambiguity that may be presented when adults consent to undergo this therapy, this Comment focuses on children, specifically those subjected to “reparative” therapy against their will.'

::::and see this as well:

::::'The word “reparative” will remain in quotation marks throughout this Comment to make the point that it incorrectly presupposes that a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender identity is one that needs to be repaired.  similarly, the word “ex-gay” will remain in quotes because whether someone can actually be converted to heterosexuality is highly debatable given the low success rate discussed below.'

::::So this is the definition that Hicks gives for &quot;reparative&quot;, as a synonym for &quot;conversion&quot;, inclusive of aversion therapy, surgery, kidnapping of children into institutions, and all other actions taken to this end in addition to counseling.  Now we can see that the word is used this way in a paper cited by 69 papers, according to Google Scholar, whereas the APA Task Force Report by Glassgold et al is only cited by 5.

::::First of all, thanks everybody for helping me find facts about terminology.  I believe this settles the question of whether it's a synonym.  Still, the words are given different treatment in the literature.  I'm going to change my recommendation to the following: Wikipedia should adopt Hicks' convention of putting &quot;reparative&quot; in quotes to demonstrate this disagreement with the premise from Wikipedia's verifiability policy.

== Recent addition ==

Arzonak added the following: &quot;The [[American Medical Association]]'s Journal of Ethics includes the following scenario: a pediatrician learns that his 12 year old patient has revealed a crush on another boy to his parents, who plan on taking him to a conversion therapy camp. His mother says “We’re a religious family&quot; and &quot;We want to save him from this sinful lifestyle... we are ready to make him work hard at this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25397646&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zachariah P, Blaschke GS, Weddle M| title=A request for &quot;conversion therapy&quot;. | journal=Virtual Mentor | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 11 | pages= 877-83 | pmid=25397646 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2014.16.11.ecas2-1411 | pmc= | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2014/11/ecas2-1411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that the 12 year old does not yet have the capacity for [[informed consent]], and that the clinician's duty to [[Primum non nocere|avoid harm]] and put the [[Beneficence (ethics)|best interests of his patient first]] requires him to advise &quot;against the ineffective and potentially harmful intervention that the parents favor.&quot; They emphasize &quot;culturally competent care and religious sensitivity do not imply that the clinician fails to be a strong advocate for his patient whose well-being is his first responsibility.&quot; They argue the doctor should [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentially]] provide &quot;reassurance and support&quot; to the boy, advising him about youth [[mental health]] services, as well as &quot;sensitively educating the parents&quot; about &quot;the importance of parental acceptance of their children’s sexuality&quot;. The authors argue that the boy's &quot;apparent comfort in revealing his crush to his parents reflects a generational shift in views of sexual orientation&quot; due in part to increasing acceptance of [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] and same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallup.com/poll/162689/record-high-say-gay-lesbian-relations-morally.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

Per [[WP:UNDUE]], I believe that is simply too much unnecessary detail. The key point here seems to be that someone is arguing that children cannot give informed consent to conversion therapy. It ought to be possible to summarize that point in a sentence or two; detailed scenarios about an imaginary twelve-year old are not needed here.

:This is not purely that &quot;someone is arguing that children cannot give informed consent to conversion therapy&quot; - this is about how ''doctors'' approach patients requesting information on how to deal with gay children - and the appropriateness of doctors to provide factual information that contradicts claims made on anti-gay websites, and potentially offends parents.

*'''Reply''': I may not have explained - the first author is Philip Zachariah, who is on the American Academy of Pediatrics Provisional Section on Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Health and Wellness - and the second author is the current chair of the AMA Advisory Committee on LGBT Issues. 

The AAP gave Zachariah a grant to study &quot;awareness among pediatricians about resources available for LGBTQ adolescents&quot; ([https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/Committees-Councils-Sections/Medical-Students/Documents/msnewsletter_December2012.pdf AAP newsletter - last page]) his project found &quot;a low level of awareness among pediatricians about resources available for LGBTQ adolescents&quot; - despite those resources being mentioned in the 2009 APA report (eg PFLAG).

The 2009 APA task force report recommends &quot;acceptance and support&quot; for LGBTQ adolescents - this is cited by a [http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/The-Health-of-Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-and-Transgender-People.aspx 2011 Institute of Medicine book] which [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13128&amp;page=146 states on page 146] &quot;The task force concluded that evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of efforts to change sexual orientation and that conversion therapy may cause harm to LGBT individuals by increasing internalized stigma, distress, and depression (American Psychological Association, 2009). Instead, the task force expressed support for the use of affirmative, culturally competent therapy that helps those facing distress related to their sexual orientation cope with social and internalized stigma and strengthen their social support networks&quot;

The IOM book is cited by the Committee on Adolescence from the American Association of Pediatrics in their [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/132/1/198.full#ref-1 journal article] in the official AAP journal Pediatrics which states &quot;Referral for “conversion” or “reparative therapy” is never indicated; therapy is not effective and may be harmful to LGBTQ individuals by increasing internalized stigma, distress, and depression&quot;

This is then referenced by the [http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2014/11/ecas2-1411.html source in question], which cites Pediatrics (the AAP's official publication) to argue that best practice for pediatricians is LGBT inclusive/affirming care - and that the medical ethics of AMA doctors require them to practice care for LGBTQ youth as outlined in Pediatrics (which is among the 18 citations in the paper, which you should read) - while considering the risk of offending the parents because of their religious beliefs.

I propose adding these two paragraphs:

{{talkquote|A 2013 article by the Committee on Adolescence of the [[American Association of Pediatrics]] stated &quot;Referral for “conversion” or “reparative therapy” is never indicated; therapy is not effective and may be harmful to LGBTQ individuals by increasing internalized stigma, distress, and depression.&quot;}}

{{talkquote|An article in the [[American Medical Association]]'s Journal of Ethics argues that if a pediatrician learns that parents of a 12 year old patient seek conversion therapy, the pediatrician can advise against &quot;the ineffective and potentially harmful intervention&quot; while being [[Cultural competence in health care|culturally sensitive]] of their religious objections to homosexuality. The authors argue that the doctor's [[medical ethics]] means they should place the interests of the patient above the cultural sensitivities of the parents, and [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentially]] counsel the patient about resources for LGBT youth facing bullying, and advise the parents about resources for parents of LGBT children.}}

Why there is there no discussion of transsexualism as a form of conversion therapy?  Many homosexual men do it under the premise they can become heterosexual women.  And they all believe they are converting to the opposite sex regardless of sexuality.  In some places like Iran they even force 1/2 of all homosexual couples to become transsexual.

:If you can find a reliable source that describes transsexualism as a form of conversion therapy, then by all means add this information to the article. I very much doubt that any such source exists, however. [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 02:13, 27 July 2015 (UTC)

== Transgender conversion therapy ==

This has come up previously in the archives, but it may be past due for the article to include therapies to change gender identity. [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/lgbt-conversion-therapy-ineffective-and-harmful-critics-say-1.3101838 Ontario] now bans  conversion therapy used on trans youth and President Obama has [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/us/politics/obama-to-call-for-end-to-conversion-therapies-for-gay-and-transgender-youth.html?_r=0 called] for an end to conversion therapies for transgender youth as well (this last fact is already mentioned in the article, with no comment for the difference in definitions for conversion therapy.) Since a major portion of this article covers the legal aspect of conversion therapy and the links provided are from good sources, it is worth mentioning in the article that conversion therapy can be meant to include therapies to change someone's gender identity. On the the medical side of things though there are also articles by developmental psychologist [http://www.wired.com/2015/07/must-put-end-gender-conversion-therapy-kids/ Dr. Diane Ehrensaft] and bioethecist [http://www.wired.com/2015/06/big-problem-outlawing-gender-conversion-therapies/ Alice Dreger] referencing conversion therapy for transgender youth.

:It's probably true that some sources identify attempts to alter the development of transgender people as conversion therapy. It's important, however, that the article be based on the highest-quality sources possible. I believe that it would be necessary to find a statement from an official mental-health organization such as the American Psychiatric Association.

::Can you point to a wikipedia guideline supporting that this change would need to be backed up by an organization such as the APA?  Looking over guidelines for reliable sources in this situation it seems like any of the links I shared would fit the criteria.  In a case like this it is simply up to the editors of the article to point out how different sources disagree. Anyway, please let me know if such a guideline exists since it's not up to us to make these rules. There are statements though by the [http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2292051 American College of Physicians], [http://www.apsa.org/content/2012-position-statement-attempts-change-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-or-gender American Psychoanalytic Association] and the [https://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/new/documents/HRIA_PRO_18315_SOCE_June_2015.pdf National Association of Social Workers], but I'd still like to have a clarification on wikipedia's rules in this situation.

:::Well, I think it's simply common sense. Can you think of a good reason why the article's definition of conversion therapy should ''not'' be based on statements by mental health organizations such as the APA? With all respect to Alice Dreger, her commentary doesn't carry the same degree of reliability as a statement from the APA. [[WP:RS]] states that, &quot;The reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made in the Wikipedia article and is an appropriate source for that content. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication.&quot; I've looked through the three sources you provided; it's only the third, the statement from the National Association of Social Workers, that really comes close to supporting your position. What it says, however, is &quot;The term sexual orientation change efforts (or SOCE) include any practice seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behaviors, gender identity, or gender expressions, or to reduce or eliminate sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward a person of the same gender.&quot; You will note that it refers to [[Sexual orientation change efforts]] rather than conversion therapy.

::::It'd be easier to back up your contention by pointing to specific guidelines than something fuzzy like common sense. I think it can further understanding of the topic if it mentions that some people use conversion therapy to refer to attempts to change gender identity if sources are verifiable and have enough weight. A statement from president Obama would fit that criteria, especially since a large portion of this article is about legal opinions as opposed to medical. This quote is mentioned in the article and can lead to some confusion for the reader as the article then refers to conversion therapy for gender identity while the articles definition earlier precludes such a thing. It seems cleaner to mention some sources use somewhat different definitions here of conversion therapy. This goes along with the point in the guidelines for verifiability that &quot;When reliable sources disagree, present what the various sources say, give each side its due weight, and maintain a neutral point of view.&quot;Anyway, here is a quote from that NASW  statement that supports my position.  &quot;There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not SOCE or conversion therapy can modify or change sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.&quot; This [http://www.apsa.org/content/bill-prohibit-abusive-conversion-therapy-children-moves-forward-il-mental-health statement from APsyA] more explictly supports my position and is cosigned by 13 other medical and psychiatric organizations. Note the statement also points out in the beginning that SOCE is also referred to as conversion therapy, to avoid confusion. [http://www.apsa.org/content/illinois-bans-conversion-therapy-lgbt-youth This statement from APsyA] also makes clear that their position statement I posted earlier applies to conversion therapy.

:::::President Obama stating that &quot;some people use conversion therapy to refer to attempts to change gender identity&quot; would not be an appropriate source for the definition of conversion therapy. [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]] ([[User talk:Flyer22|talk]]) 07:11, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
::::::Even if not for citations posted showing conversion therapy is a term used for gender identity conversion efforts occasionally on the medical side, this article covers the legal and political side of conversion therapy as well. Since the statement from the president is already in the article, and since there exists laws like in Ontario that ban conversion therapy aimed at gender identity, I think it'd be more consistent to mention there is more than one definition used for conversion therapy and be clear about what sources go by which definition. The other definition is already being used in the article, making the article inconsistent as is. [[User:Rab V|Rab V]] ([[User talk:Rab V|talk]]) 09:52, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
