==POV Issues==


I just edited a sentence which read &quot;Currently, Sonia Gandhi is campaigning for her son, Rahul Gandhi for a successful campaign to be the next European Prime Minister of India.&quot; This article is used to air petty conspiracy theories. 


== Education ==
Would somebody write about Sonias education qualilification? The article does not give all information about her.

==Devnagari==

Maybe it's the way it renders on Mozilla that's the problem. However, I get, roughly transliterated, s-o-n-yi-a, which, needless to say, is not correct. Should be s-o-ni-y-a, with the &amp;#2367; on the &amp;#2344;, correct? [[User:Graft|Graft]] 19:02, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)


Fixed this, as you suggested. [[User:Venkatr_n]]


:First thing first, its Devanagari not Devnagari (I make this mistake too.) Now about Soniya Gandhi. I use Yudit for writing Devanagari and in the transliteration scheme I use this is what is written:

soniyaa gaa.Ndhii (or soniyA gA.NdhI) 

:It render's as this:&amp;#2360;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2344;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2351;&amp;#2366; &amp;#2327;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2305;&amp;#2343;&amp;#2368; and looks absolutely fine. The result is what is expected. Now I don't know how this: &amp;#2360;&amp;#2379;&amp;#2367;&amp;#2344;&amp;#2351;&amp;#2366; &amp;#2327;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2344;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2343;&amp;#2368; can be generated in my transliteration scheme but it creates the problem of separating the &amp;#2367; and the &amp;#2344;. Now about what you see I suggest you go to [http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/news/020624_priyanka_as.shtml BBC Hindi] and if you see the same rendering with the &amp;#2367; after the &amp;#2344; then I think it has nothing to do with your browser but its your Operating System. If you are using Linux get the latest version, if you are using Windows 2000/XP install support for Indic fonts from your Windows CD and if you are using something else - I don't know what can be done. Hope that helps. -[[User:Ankur|Ankur]] 04:21, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::Hmm... the BBC also renders wrong for me. I'm using Firefox on Linux with current revisions, so I guess there's some error here (or at least an inconsistency between Firefox and IE). I'm inclined to believe that Firefox conforms to standards, but I guess time will resolve this on its own. (also, incidentally, Devnagari is fine as a transliteration) [[User:Graft|Graft]] 04:58, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:::I am sure it is not a browser problem. I think it is the responsibility of your Desktop environment to render fonts properly. Its more likely that you did not install support for Indic languages. KDE supported Hindi last year in version 3.2, here is a screenshot from trolltech website [http://trolls.troll.no/lars/konqueror_hindi.png]. Gnome supports it too. --[[User:Ankur|Ankur]] 15:24, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Wrong year of birth for Priyanka? ==
This article says that Priyanka was born in 1972.  The article about Priyanka herself says 1971.

==Removal==

Articles on this site should be from neutral point of view, not BJP Propaganda,  Entire article is written with negative slur. Even the comment above (the first one) reflects that...
As of now I am deleting this line &quot;But Sonia remains at the post of the Leader of the Majority, which she has kept to herself for controlling the Prime minister(?????), and the Chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party (all Congress MPs).&quot;
Would like it if someone would flag this as non neutral and completely rewrite this article

John 

[[User:Yohajohn|Yohajohn]] 04:54, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

: I agree completely. The old article was ludicrous and quite shockingly anti-Sonia. The new one is much better.

=&gt; Yohajohn, Please be aware that statements may be anti-Sonia; that does not make them false or incorrect. (Statements about Adolf Hitler nowadays are generally 'Anti-Hitler' - that does not make false. Or are you questioning the gas-chamber atrocities??).

&quot;Sonja Gandhi...  GAS CHAMBER ATROCITIES!!!&quot; 
Hilarious!! I love it! You BJP types are so damn funny. And so semi-literate. Sometimes I almost wish you'd get back into government, just for the sheer hilarity of it all. Ah, but you won't.

[[User:Yohajohn|Yohajohn]] 05:15, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
I am a fool and Sonia is a traitor.

Hmm... a statement almost as suspicious as the December 13 2001 &quot;terrorist attacks&quot;.

==Volker report Removal==

The para on the volker report is factually incorrect. I original allegation in the volker report is Natwar Singh/Congress.
Which is interpreted as Natwr Singh of the congress. There is no allegation on Soni Gandhi or Congress, even by the BJP. This para doesnot belong. Its should at best be added on page of Natwar Sing or Indian National Congress (INC)

I will be removing this para after waiting for time period for comments

: You are a cheat and seem to be a paid servant of Sonia Maino. There are reports that she wrote a letter to Saddam Hussein and it names her party as the beneficiary at a time when she was the President.

:: Please try to discuss instead of flaring up. The 'reports' on Volker report only mentions Natwar Singh and Congress. Therefore it should be placed rightly on Natwar Sing or Congress page. If u look at the article on Indian National Congress. U will see that the article is already there. On ur point that she was president of Congress...Does that mean theat we have to put Tehlka scam and all other scam that tool place when A.B. Vajpayee was in government on the Vajpayee page. Definitely no. I believe only the ones on which the person has been directly been accused of should be put up. In fact bofors allegation is a more appropriate article to be put under title 'Political Accusation'.

::: I think it was a great idea, that the Volcker Report para was removed altogether. I saw it mentioning Sonia Gandhi, and immediately edited it, removing her name. I am glad the para is not mentioned at all now. And please ignore this person who seems to be from the RSS. Even POV is ok,but factually unproved stuff such as &quot;Natwar Singh is the foot soldier for the Congress&quot; should not be included in a Wikipedia entry. The post below has noted this, and I too had noted the use of term &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, among those who opposed her prime-ministership. Who were these so called &quot;freedom fighters&quot;? I am glad that is gone too. The new article is much more balanced and fair.
::::Some idiot said &quot;And please ignore this person who seems to be from the RSS.&quot;. I would like to tell that the Wikipedia is as much of the [[RSS]] as much it is yours. Why do you mean by &quot;ignoring&quot;? Is this Yahoo! chat? UPA-led government may not allow free speech but [[Jimmy Wales]]-led Wikimedia project DOES. Should I make some comments on your race, complexion and religion? Should I prophecy that you are a black [[Christian]] from the southern [[India]]? Please refrain from making such gross statements. RSS is a patriotic organisation for a majority of Indians. No fact would be concealed. Lastly, learn to sign talk pages after defacing them (just like I do...LOL). ;) [[User:BADMINton|&amp;#9812;BADMIN&amp;#9819;]] [[User_talk:BADMINton|('''&amp;#2310;&amp;#2323;&amp;#9997;''')]] 09:07, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Removed line on supporter of Benito Mussolini ==
I looked over some references on her father being mussolini supporter. It may be true, it may not be true. Rigjt now I don't have any authentic references for that point. So it will remaim deleted till it can be removed

:Here is an authentic reference: /*Quote*/ I ask him about Eugenio Maino's alleged Fascist sympathies. &quot;That shouldn't surprise you. He came from Asiago not far from Vicenza in the Veneto region where nationalism was strong. He fought in the Russian campaign alongside the Germans and remained true to Fascist Nationalist ideology all his life. I have even heard it said that he belonged to the Salo Republic that Mussolini set up in 1943 after he was ousted by his son-in-law. That is what people say but I have no confirmation of it. He even gave his three daughters Russian names in honour of the campaign in which he fought. He venerated the Duce. Many still do,&quot; says Giovanni, referring to Italy's war-time Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. /*Unquote*/ from 
http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1509/15090140.htm
Authentic enough?

The author of the Hindu Times article (see link) made a mistake: &quot;for to go to Orbassano one has to get off the motorway and drive a good 20 km or so up the road to Vicenza&quot;, Vicenza is to the East of Milan unlike Turin which is to the West. 
Article seems v.biased; the author found no evidence and few people willing to talk. He (journo) was left with a relative who didn't own up to being a relative and was rude to him, hardly damming stuff. Can you imagine how much media they have had snooping around?

== Biased writing/editing ==

I have made the three changes to this article on Mrs. Sonia Gandhi which I think are very essential in order to maintain the character and value of Wikipedia as a forum with impartial and correct (or atleast close to it) information. People should desist from colouring the infomration here with their own affinities and prejudices.

The opposition to Sonia Gandhi's candidature as Prime Minister was on account of her foreign origins and on account of the fact that she retained her Italian citizenship for 15 years and took Indian citizenship only in 1982. This opposition was not only from the right wing BJP, but also from a section of the common populace. Besides, there was opposition within the coalition and within the congress party itself, on account of which three senior leaders split the congree to form the &quot;Nationalist Congress Party&quot;.

Moreover, this issues was there right from the point she stepped in the political arena and being well of this she contested the parliamentary elections from two constituencies, just in case she looses from one. Both these consituencies were Congress strongholds and elected only Congress candidates for decades i.e. Amethi and Bellary constituencies and was elected from both. She subsequently gave up the Bellary seat as required by law.

Besides, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi studied at some language school in Cambridge, not in Cambridge University as is sought to be portrayed. 

Please desist from vandalising the material here to suit your own interests and image.


:: Yes but u dont need to character assasinate the person just because u fon't like. here is point by point rebuttal

a) On the point of mentioning her citizenship...the original post contained that she took citizenship onlt after 1983 after rajiv gandhi became prime minister (because it was felt to be only a formality). You don't have to additinally mention 15 years its irrevelant (anyone can see that from fates)

b) Only language school in cambridge...The article did not say she did a language school in canbridge university It just said she studied in cambridge, if u misread it as cambridge university thats ur own fault...and i don't think u need to emphasis its cambridge ...when i say i studied in kanpur it doesnot mean i studied in IIT kanpur noe do i have to add to my biodata that i didn't study in kanpur IIIT I hope u see the difference.

c) On ur point there is not much refernce to her 'candidature as Prime Minister was on account of her foreign origins' in fact the entire article only talks about that in fact the article should be renamed as &quot;Reasons why sonia should not be Prime Minister&quot; rather than a profile of Sonia Gandhi. The main opposition was from right wing bjp and to a degree sharad pawar and company both were mentioned.

d) On ur contention is contested from two seats safe seats ...I don't see how that is revelant. In India almost all important leaders sometimes contest from two seats even Advani does so...i don't see what point u r trying to make from this. Infact she won with record margin from both the seats

== More Biased Writing ==
This article also makes claims that Indians are so gullible that &quot;that they think any person who puts Gandhi in his/her name is a saint&quot; and that &quot;worshiping foreigners comes easily to Indians.&quot; [[User:Warzonewes|Warzonewes]] 20:51, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

== Photo ==

Please post an real not-doctored photo of sonia. current photo with a doctored back-ground of indian tri-color (colors of indian national flag) is disturbing! for example look at the pages of USA presidents and their photos!

== POV again ==

Much of the BJP propaganda has been filtered, but now the article seems haphazard, perhaps biased the othe way around.

First, the Congress party did not win any surprise victory. The BJP, even after losing the strength to form Government, still has only a few members less than the Congress. The UPA coalition is a Post-poll alliance stiched together with support from the Communist-bloc of parties. So it is essentially a bipolar government with the centrist Congress and the Left. This arrangement is one of the reasons that there are fire-fights in the UPA. Credit to Ms Gandhi should instead be given for revitalizing a party that many had written off.

As for being a political novice, well, even four years as a Cabinet minister are not at all sufficient for a Prime-Ministerial chair. So, for all intents and purposes, she was a novice when compared with some of the other senior leaders in her own party. It should instead be credited to her political acumen that she not only outmanoeuvered the NDA, but also reliquished the Prime Minister's chair for the reasons mentioned.

Finally, the defeat of the NDA was due to a large number of other factors, independent of the Congress party. They were widely criticised for corruption (although none of the charges have been proven), and were generally seen as inept administrators who failed to deliver on their election promises. So, the ''Aam Aadmi'' bit shopuld be put into perspective.


:: 'First, the Congress party did not win any surprise victory'. It was a susprise victory even the bjp accepts that. From all accounts it looked like BJP led NDA alliance would comfortably win absolute majority

'Finally, the defeat of the NDA was due to a large number of other factors.' Agreed that is so in all elections, there is no single factor which constitutes victory and analysis of reason why NDA failed in election is not purpose of this article. What is revelant here is that being leader of opossition party she and the slogan it was symbolic of bjps defeat (something like saying that Winston churchil withstood the germans in second world was though he never fought the battle himself and there were man other factors involved, He was symbolic of the sucess of britian)

== Removal ==

Have removed removed the following as it is factually in correct. 

{{blprefactor|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sonia_Gandhi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72554307}}

Plaese read the link i have added as the Supreme Court of India has dismissed two PILs filed in this regard. I believe the Supreme Court of India is the competent authority on the constitution of India.

== Citations Needed ==

There are a ton of statements in the main article on controversial subjects that havent yet been cited. I'm leaving them in for the moment, but I would like to see some references soon. [[User:Hornplease|Hornplease]] 23:31, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== Cite properly please ==

The allegations that are conitunally put in the article as &quot;persistent&quot; are not some that have been aired in the press as often as the article makes it sound. The reference provided is from a single article, and that too written by a BJP MP. If you can find a report or citation that indicates that this is a &quot;commonly-held&quot; belief, please cite it and only then reinstate the reference. I certainly have not heard it, unlike the often-expressed concern that she took 15-16 years to gain Indian citizenship. [[User:Hornplease|Hornplease]] 21:16, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

== Bribed by KGB? ==
I just found an interesting article [http://www.boloji.com/myword/mw042.htm].
Author make a reference to another source (Evgenia Albats) who had an access to KGB documents and says: ''KGB chief Victor Chebrikov in December 1985 had sought in writing from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), &quot;authorization to make payments in US dollars to the family members of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, namely Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Ms Paola Maino, mother of Sonia Gandhi.&quot; CPSU payments were authorized by a resolution, CPSU/CC/No 11228/3 dated 20/12/1985; and endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers in Directive No 2633/Rs dated 20/12/1985. These payments had been coming since 1971, as payments received by Sonia Gandhi's family and &quot;have been audited in CPSU/CC resolution No 11187/22 OP dated 10/12/1984.”'' I also found very similar information in the book ''The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World'' by Mitrokhin (see [[Mitrokhin Archive]]). Mitrokhin described in great detail how suitcases with KGB money traveled to Indira Gandhi office.  Is that something that deserves attention and should be mentioned in this Wikipedia article?

== Transliteration ==

I doubt that the transliteration provided is the correct one. The Italian name &quot;Sonia&quot; is usually pronounced [sonja] and not [soːnɪja]. The latter is a correct transliteration of the Hindi/Punjabi word सोनिया, which again is not her name, but the closest Indian approximation. For that matter, should the Devanagri name be included at all, given how her name is an Italian one. [[User:Gamesmasterg9|Gamesmaster G-9]] 19:13, 13 December 2006 (UTC)


==Too Little==

This is a very very brief article for one of India's most prominent political leaders. Does anyone have any information about Sonia' role as wife of the Prime Minister. I know she used to campaign for him during elections. More on the Sitaram Kesri controversy, the Mamta, Madhav Rao, Sangma resignations on her taking over and the &quot;renouncement&quot; effect would be useful.

== What is encyclopaedic after all? ==

Can any one clarify as to why following passage isn't encyclopaedic , a reason  for which it has been removed by [[Aksi]]?After all, great leaders like Sonia ji have great personal qualities about them that can't be ignored.

&quot;Sonia ji has immense firm faith in Almighty. She listens only to her INNER VOICE.Thats why she gave up lucrative post of Prime Ministership of India! She is a determined lady with grit. Swami Apratimanand Ji had predicted on 14th May, 2006 that she would be &quot;...defeated in Raibarelly election by Uma Bharati’s lady candidate. This shall be one of the most spectacular political upsets witnessed in the year 2006.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.msn.com/geography/spiritualgeog.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=190&amp;LastModified=4675600510866700585]&lt;/ref&gt;Political situation indeed was against her in UP then.But, she proved Swami Ji's prediction wrong through her grit, determination and blessings of Lord Hanumana whose blessings she had sought by visiting Lord Hanumana's temple before contesting the election.She has blended herself perfectly with Indian spiritual milieu. She is a lady with a golden heart who cares tenderly for ordinary Indians. She has carved out a special niche on her own in Indian history.&quot;

I agree with Amit. This is a completely wrong to mention such sensitive information (even though it might be true) without any references.
Some facts are known to everyone but still should not be made public in such a way where the world has access to it.
It was shocking for everyone in India about the quick wedding of Sonia and Rajiv.
It was very unplanned and secret ceremony. People anticipated a big function as it was wedding of the Prime minister in house's son. Now everyone can sense what could be the reason (They got married in end 1969 and Rahul was born in June 1970.

Anyways, now it is known that Rahul Gandhi's girlfriend is [[Spanish]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=30839&lt;/ref&gt; but does that mean it should be put in wikipedia?

==This looks like a article maintained by Congress leaders in India==
This looks like a article edited  by Indian Congress leaders.
Any statement which is anti Sonia (even if it is true) is removed immediately.
e.g her study thing, her desparation of becoming Prime Minister in 2002, her comedy &quot;inner voice&quot; which appeared immediately after president visit.
Also the controversy section like her presence in United Nations without holding any Indian post, her nationality accceptance after 18 years, her suuden entry into politics was also removed by some strong congress supporters.

:I don't think you understand. You can't put your '''OPINIONS''' in Wikipedia. You actually put the following quote into the article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&quot;People think that [[Sonia Gandhi]] did a lot of sacrifice for the country. But her opponets say that if she had been in [[Italy]] she could not have afforded a one bed room flat. Here in [[India]] she is enjoying all benefits with the closeness of many men. What sacrifice she has done? &quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Don't you understand? You can't say that in Wikipedia!! When you say those kinds of things, you are giving your opinion! Please let's keep Wikipedia to be a professional article. This article is not pro-Sonia. It does not say that she is a &quot;good leader&quot; or that she did the right things. This article should only list her birthplace, her marriage, and the events of her political career. I respect your opinion but maybe you don't understand what Wikipedia is. This is NOT a place to issue opinions without fact. When you make opinions that she was a &quot;naughty student&quot; and that she and Rajiv were &quot;on the verge of divorce&quot; you MUST put a reference. --[[User:Mezaco|Mezaco]] 22:26, 9 October 2007 (UTC)


Dear Mezaco, Even facts put by me were removed.
Please do a open discussion I am ready

1. She tried her best to become PM in 2002. This is a fact.
2. Her Hindi is average and she can not speak without a piece of paper. This is a fact.
3. She met Indian Idol finalists. This is a fact.
4. Her &quot;inner voice&quot; suddenly appeared. This is a FACT.

Don't you understand?

::Hi. This article does already mention that one of the main criticisms her critics have against her is that she is not proficient in Hindi. That's how you word things in a Wikipedia article. You cannot say that &quot;she has no right to lead the country because she can't speak Hindi&quot;. Also, many Indian people can't speak Hindi. The last time I checked English was an official language and it was one of the most common languages used in parliament, in government and in the press. Secondly, she met Indian Idol finalists??? What does that have to do with anything?? Is that really important? And thirdly, this article already does mention many critics criticized her renunciation decision as a &quot;political stunt&quot;. It says very clearly that while some people praised her decisions, others said it was a political stunt. If you have written PROOF that she said she wanted to be prime minister, please reference it. You can add any FACTS you want to in this article, but you have to put a ''REFERENCE''. If you put a reference it will probably not be deleted. 
::But there are many cases in this article of things that are not pro-Sonia. It mentions her failure to secure 272 votes, it mentions the revolt of Sharad Pawar, it mentions her lack of Hindi, it mentions the Office of Profit scandal, it mentions Quattrocchi, it mentions the United Nations Speech row, etc. etc. It does not hide facts that put her in a bad light. But you CAN'T put your opinions such as ''&quot;what sacrifice has she done?&quot;''. Also, I even added a &quot;Controversy&quot; section to show that many people have strong criticisms about her. I don't think that this article makes her look too good at all. Thank you!--[[User:Mezaco|Mezaco]] 21:36, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

== Why genuine sections are being removed? ==
Section &quot;Dispute with Left Parties&quot; was removed by user Blnguyen.
Can we please know why such an informative section was removed?
It contained a lot of references to genuine websites and hence can not be treated as somebody's personal opinions.
This section was not abusive, was not having Vandalism and more importantly was NOT anti Sonia.

:I'm not &quot;bossing here&quot;, I removed it because a portion of one of Sonia Gandhi's speech doesn't constitute a signficant enough detail to be included here. I'm sure you could add plenty of trivia about her, but this is not the place for it. I think I have adequately explained the reasoning. There's no question of bias here as the portion in question was neither pro or anti-sonia, it was just superflous.

Hi Amit,
I would like to know your role in wikipedia. Are you one of the owners or group of admins?
Please let me know.
If I have inserted some comments which you did not like in past, that does not mean you remove the genuine sections inserted by me.

I am waiting for your answer after which I will take this entire matter to the concerned people in wikipedia.
Not just because you are deleting the information unnecessarily, but also because of the &quot;no respect for others view&quot; you have.

Hi guys. If I could just add my two cents. People seem to think that this article is a place to debate politics. This article is not a place to discuss every event of the UPA government! This article is a '''biography''' article on Sonia Gandhi. Some people seem to want to make this article a long and passionate debate on Congress Party politics. This is a BIOGRAPHY. It should only discuss very specific events relating to the life of Sonia Gandhi. If you wish to discuss other things, it should be put in a different article. There has been far far too much vandalism to this article and because some of the Sonia haters have made such ridiculous comments in the past (like the &quot;what sacrifice has she done&quot; comment), of course people are going to be very very watchful of what is added to this website. If you wish to debate Indian politics, please go to a different website or please create your own [[blog]], because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia only and if we add every political event that has happened in the last 8 years during Sonia's time in politics, this article will become far far too long. If you wish to discuss the Left Parties and the Nuclear issue, there is a whole article created just for that topic! I think that's why it was probably cut out. It was not specifically relevant to Sonia Gandhi's life. Thank you. --[[User:Mezaco|Mezaco]] 17:58, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

==Are these things true==
I have found following information on one of the websites.
Are these points or some of the points true?

&lt;rm per [[WP:BLP]] and discussion at [[WP:ANI]].&gt; 

No newspaper has taken up the issue, no political party is opposing 
this,people are falling in line as if this is nothing unusual. Have we 
forgotten history, it was this Indian passiveness that led to India 
becoming a British slave. A Nuclear Weapons state, the biggest 
democracy on planet and a foreigner will walk in to the highest 
office without having contested an election, without having ever 
talked to the media on any issue as if it were a piece of cake. Are 
we going to witness this mockery of Indian State,are we really a 
bunch of such slaves who, despite freedom of speech will not speak 
out. 

Do we need another round of 'Civilizing'. Any Basu, any 
Mulayam, born in the heat and dust of India preferable to the 'Senora' 
as our leader It is said that former prime minister HD Deve Gowda 
acted as if he was prime minister of Karnataka while another P.M. 
I.K. Gujral acted like a foreign minister. Now Congress is busy 
promoting a former au-pair maid and a house wife for 
Prime-ministership only on the basis of her last name.

I have removed the two lines on dismissal of corruption cases against Ms Gandhi. The line 17 years of Janata Dal, Third Front and BJP rule is factually incorrect as together, these formations ruled the country only 9 years, of these, 2 with Congress support. The supposed link given in support was of a Tribune View point which solely dealt with the issue of Indian Black Money in Swiss Banks. The other contention about Vajpayee Government not finding any proof is all the more laughable. Reference is set by a Swiss Banking Association report of 2006.

:::Okay. My reasoning: She lacks any strong enough connection to the Hindi language to warrant a transcription of her name into it. First of all, she is of Italian origin and in that sense not foundationally connected to Hindi-speaking Uttar Pradesh, unlike her relatives Jawaharlal, Indira, Rajiv, etc. who are of Kashmiri Brahmin stock which migrated to UP some 300 years ago. Second, we can simply notice that her first name Sonia is of Italian source, and that having said that, her last name by marriage is but of Gujarati source in addition. This contrasts with her children Rahul and Priyanka, whose first names are conventionally north Indian and would warrant a Hindi transcription.

I agree, he is removing every comment which sounds against Sonia Gandhi.
He has removed the sections like Critism, her poor performance in all elections except 2004, notice by EC.
All the sections were unbiased and contained both sides (her critics and party workers as well).
He is giving funny reasons like &quot;poorly structured&quot; which is not a valid reason to remove a section.
If it is &quot;poorly structured&quot; as he claims, why don't he structure it?

Hello there,
These sections are strongly required.
If this is a &quot;political commentary&quot; and needs to be removed as per you, then we need to remove almost 80% of the article including sections like
Congress President
Leader of the Opposition
2004 elections and aftermath
UPA Chairperson and &quot;her sacrifice of Prime Minister's post&quot;.
She is a political leader and if her party is winning or loosing any elections, this strongly needs to be a part of article on her.
&quot;Notice by Election Commission of India&quot; is also a significant milestone in her political career, as this is the first time an action has been taken by one of the highest constitutional party on her. This also had created differences in the party.
&quot;All wins are due to sonia agandhi and all losses due to party memebers&quot; is not some layman's statement, but statement from party spokesperson and also was conclusion of the meeting of CWC (Congress Working Committee) which happened after Gujarat Election defeat.
I hope the above explanation is enough for your question &quot;why I shouldn't, do it now?&quot;.
About your favourite statement &quot;and have no place in an encyclopedia, besides they violate [[WP:BLP]]&quot;, I think enough discussion has been done on the wikipedia main page that no individual can decide whether something has place in wikipedia or if something violates wiki norms. NOt even admins. So definitely, you can not decide that.
I respect you as one of the valuable contributors in wikipedia, and hence expect the continued co operation from you henceforth also.
I hope I have clarified all the queries.

Mr. ReluctantPhilosopher, I am not surprised to see your response.
First of all, my apology is not to you. It is for all readers to wikipedia who deserve to read neutral and unbiased information about Sonia Gandhi, one of the most powerful leaders in India.
And about discussing first and then revert, it is strange who is talking about it.
You had been reverting all sections earlier without any discussion.
You started doing it for namesake when you were warned by some senior editors.
Then, you raised a query above &quot;I'm going to fix it; if anyone can provide any good reason why I shouldn't, do it now.&quot;
I answered it in a most elaborate way. Still you removed it.
And looks like in your dictionary &quot;fixing&quot; = &quot;deleting&quot;.
Looks like, you do not know the concepts of correcting it gramatically and all.
I had to answer you personally, because you are raising personal comments against me now.
I really wish to stop it. That is the reason I have taken it to a forum requesting third party opinion.

:I have had enough of your personal attacks. Stop accusing me of &quot;connections&quot; with Sonia Gandhi. In fact I demand an apology for all your personal insinuations against me. As for discussions, you are the one who refuses to discuss the content you add. For your kind information, here are, once again, the reasons why your &quot;content&quot; isn't appropriate:

:1. It is against [[WP:BLP]] You state that here &quot;vote catching abilities&quot; are in serious doubt. This is political/editorial commentary, even if it were lifted from a newspaper, it doesn't qualify as sourced material
:2. &quot;Her supporters claim all wins are due to Sonia and all losses are due to local factors&quot;. Where did you get that nonsense from? Do you have the slightest idea what encyclopeadic standards demand?
:3. &quot;This was a big blow on her considering her family's dignity&quot; The &quot;big blow&quot; is pure nonsensical POV interpretation of the turn of events and I won't even go into the &quot;family's dignity&quot; part - don't tell me THAT too is sourced.

:You are making a mess of reasonable good article that still needs considerable improvement. And you are indulging in personal attacks even after serving a ban for sockpuppeteering.

Oh, so you believe in discussions also?
Good to know that.
Can you please refer to section &quot;Political commentary&quot;. You had asked for &quot;reasons&quot; for &quot;not deleting&quot; certain section.
I believe, I tried to explain you in detail with a calm mind.
Without any second thought, you gave a judgement (as per your habit) that rest all is neutral and what i am saying is incorrect.
I may be wrong, but I don't want to hear it from a highly adamant fellow like you.
And about apology, in fact I demand for an apology for starting &quot;personal attack&quot; on 11:21, 17 January 2008  in the same section. I was doing apology to the wikipedia users. There was no need for you to put your nose in.

Please stay calm. I am not making personal attacks, you started it. I did not accuse you for any &quot;connections&quot;. I was saying I am not sure what is your connection with Sonia Gandhi.
Below is the explanation of how your concerns are not valid, according to me. (I don't want to pass judgements, like you)
1. If this is the case, what is the source for following statements?
a. &quot;Following the unexpected defeat of the NDA, she was widely expected to be the next Prime Minister of India&quot;
b. &quot;A few days after the election, Gandhi declined the leadership of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha, and by doing so, rejected the post as prime minister&quot;.
  Who knows, some people say, it was APJ Abdul Kalam who refused to accept her claim to become PM and hence she &quot;had to&quot; decline the post.
c. &quot; Her action was hailed by some as part of the old Indian tradition of renunciation&quot;. Who said so?

2. &quot;Her supporters claim all wins are due to Sonia and all losses are due to local factors&quot;. Where did you get that nonsense from? Do you have the slightest idea what encyclopeadic standards demand?

Now see who said I am uncivilised. If you think it is nonsense. Fine.
If that is nonsense, point 1a, 1b and 1c are also nonsense.

3. &quot;This was a big blow on her considering her family's dignity&quot; The &quot;big blow&quot; is pure nonsensical POV interpretation of the turn of events and I won't even go into the &quot;family's dignity&quot; part - don't tell me THAT too is sourced.
Same as point 1.

According to me it is you who is making a mess of good neutral article by adding highly one sided information which is mainly praising Sonia Gandhi. You are deleting any information which you think is against her and thus doing a heavy damage to the article.
What you will take to become a bit professional?
[[User:Inder315|Inder315]] ([[User talk:Inder315|talk]]) 11:36, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

:This article is NOT one-sided and it definitely doesn't &quot;praise Sonia&quot;. It has a criticism section. If you have problems with other parts of the article we can discuss those, but they don't provide you the excuse to insert your OPINION in the article. Do you understand? This is a biographical article. It should only have information pertaining to her birth, life, and important milestones of her political career. You can't add opinions about her &quot;vote catching abilities&quot; and her &quot;family's dignity&quot;. Your gibberish hardly amounts to a response. Your statement &quot;Who knows ...&quot; betrays your tendency to speculate and addd [[WP:FRINGE]] theories And I see you still haven't taken the trouble of indenting your comments. [[User:ReluctantPhilosopher|ReluctantPhilosopher]] ([[User talk:ReluctantPhilosopher|talk]]) 15:00, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

Ok, if that is the case what the following sentences are doing in this article?
They are also a &quot;political commentry&quot; as per your theory.
And according to you, your &quot;opinion&quot; is the &quot;fact&quot;
1. When the BJP-led NDA formed a government under Atal Behari Vajpayee, she took on the office of the Leader of Opposition. As Leader of Opposition she called a no-confidence motion against the NDA government led by Vajpayee in 2003.

2. A few days after the election, Gandhi declined the leadership of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha, and by doing so, rejected the post as prime minister. Her action was hailed by some as part of the old Indian tradition of renunciation,

3. On May 18, she recommended noted economist Dr. Manmohan Singh for the Prime Minister's post.

I want to know when the following incidence was televised.
&quot;Her action was hailed by some as part of the old Indian tradition of renunciation&quot;.
Other things might be televised but till it is &quot;political commentary&quot;.

fyi, &quot;&quot;Her supporters claim all wins are due to Sonia and all losses are due to local factors&quot; is not my statement.
It is statement of Abhishek Singhvi (Congress spokeperson) after the meeting of CWC following defeat in Gujarat election.
In that meeting, the Pradesh Congress committee was held responsible, whereas Sonia had campaigned heavily in that election.
At the same time, she was awarded the credit of the partial win of Congress in 2004.
And last but not the least, &quot;Notice by election commission of India&quot; is definitely not my &quot;opinion&quot;
If you watch TV and can understand what these guys say, this was a &quot;breaking news&quot; on almost all the channels on that day.
You are just finding execuses to delete the portion which you don't like.
That's it.

If you want to publish your findings, go start your own blog, but don't put those in Wikipedia. Secondly, [[WP:Notability]] explicitly states that &quot;breaking news of the day&quot; doesn't go down as encyclopaedic material automatically.

[[User:ReluctantPhilosopher|ReluctantPhilosopher]] ([[User talk:ReluctantPhilosopher|talk]]) 08:19, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

Good one. You have easily avoided all of my questions.
I am putting them once again. Please read my comments before reacting in a hasty manner.
:1. I want to know when the following incidence was televised.
   &quot;Her action was hailed by some as part of the old Indian tradition of renunciation&quot;
:2. As told already (I don't even know whether you read my comments properly before reacting), &quot;&quot;Her supporters claim all wins are due to Sonia and all losses are due to local factors&quot; is not my statement.
It is statement of Abhishek Singhvi (Congress spokeperson) after the meeting of CWC following defeat in Gujarat election.
:3. About breaking news, do not take it in literal sense. Take it in absolute sense. It was a breaking news without doubt and it also had a long term impact on Indian masses, including the defeat of Congress in Gujarat. So it is an important milestone in Sonia's political career and even in Indian politics for that matter. It is definitely notable.
:4. As told earlier, if the article should contain only biographical information, then we need to remove almost 80% of the article including sections like Congress President, Leader of the Opposition, 2004 elections and aftermath etc.
::Stop MISLEADING people !!! I went your source and nowhere do they attribute the sentence &quot;all wins are due to sonia and all losses due to local factors&quot; to Abhishek Singhvi, that is the article writers own statement. As for the renunciation statement, we could discuss the sources for that if needed, but that doesn't give you the excuse to insert FALSE information in the article. For God's sake is there nobody else who is watching this article and can intervene? [[User:ReluctantPhilosopher|ReluctantPhilosopher]] ([[User talk:ReluctantPhilosopher|talk]]) 10:33, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
Even if we assume that what you are saying about this particular statement is correct, what about other questions? 1,2 and 4?
Also, even I am desparately looking for someone who can intervene your dominance.
And as told time and again, for god's sake &quot;Do not think that your opinion is fact, and sourced information by others is a &quot;political commentry&quot;.
As you would have noticed, I have reverted all deletes by you as they are pending for third opinion.
Agreeing to you to a certain extent (rather than being adamant like you), I have corrected point no. 2 (Abhishek Singhvi part).
Hope this solves your problem.
Unless you have any valid reason (than just don't like it), please do not remove it.
You need to learn to respect others opinions and stop damaging a reasonably good article on most powerful and famous Indian politician.
[[User:Inder315|Inder315]] ([[User talk:Inder315|talk]]) 17:31, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

And I have told you upteen times, I am NOT going to remove the content just because you think it has &quot;as such have no place in a wikipedia article&quot;.
And I am reverting it again.
And I am still waiting for your comments for point 1, 3 and 4.
I am sure you don't have any answers to it and hence accusing me for same stuff again and again.
And about banning me, in fact I demand that you should be banned (including your sockpuppets) permannently for dominating an article and doing damage to it.
You are not allowing anyine else to contribute in a fair way and working like a watch dog on this.
This is clear as you are reverting any single comment within 24 Hrs.
Sticking to my earlier comment, Even if you remove it again, I will still revert it unless a third party intervenes (not your sockpuppet).

:Who exactly are you accusing me of using as a sockpuppet? There's no third party making coments here !!! Anyway, more to the point,  here are your answers:

:1. You may remove the renunciation statement if you please, someone can reinsert it when the reference is available.

:2. You have accepted that you misused reference on this one.

:3. The notice is not significant enough to warrant it's own &quot;Section&quot;!

:4. The other parts describe &quot;events&quot;, not analyses of &quot;vote catching abilities&quot;

:I have created and RfC. Your 3rd opinion doesn't seem to have drawn any response. I'm not reverting for now. Let's see how the RfC goes. And for god's stake stop asking me to &quot;cool down&quot; and &quot;stop using sockpuppets&quot; ... it makes you look ridiculous and draws attention to the fact that you're the one who was blocked for sockpuppetry, and are showing no remorse for it.

'''ReluctantPhilosopher's position'''&lt;br /&gt;
The material added by Inder315, namely the second half of &quot;Criticism&quot; section starting &quot;Questions are being asked now&quot;, and the entire &quot;Notice by Election Commission of India&quot; section should be removed as it is in violation of [[WP:NOT]] and [[WP:NPOV]], besides [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:NOTABILITY]]. I welcome neutral editors to read the sections in question and decide on the validity of my objections. I would also like to point out that [[User:Inder315]] was recently blocked by [[User:Blnguyen]] for operating three other puppet accounts[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sonia_Gandhi&amp;diff=181798005&amp;oldid=181618271] to inappropriately argue for a consensus on this talk page.[[User:ReluctantPhilosopher|ReluctantPhilosopher]] ([[User talk:ReluctantPhilosopher|talk]]) 13:42, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

'''Inder315's position'''
I thought I should reply the allegations on me so that this self proclaimed owner of article Sonia Gandhi scholar does not get benefit of my silence. I don;t know which FALSE REFERENCES he is talking about. If you check the history, you will easily find who started personal attack. He terms &quot;political commentary &quot; to each and everything (including properly sourced material) which he does not agree with or does not like, to be precise. He is also known to find various excuses for deleting a section of part of section which he does not like. Examples of execuses

:1. Unsourced or poorly sourced (all the sections which he talks about are properly sourced).
:2. Grammatically incorrect (could be, but is deleting a section is definitely NOT a solution to it. Why he does not correct it?)
:3. Political commentry (now it is his opinion. What gives him a right to delete a section without a second thought?)
:4. Not notable (Who is he to decide it alone?)
:5. This does not have a place in wikipedia (Again the same. Is he owner of wikipedia?)
He demands &quot;discuss first, THEN revert&quot; but if one checks his editing history, he had been reverting all sections earlier without any discussion. He started doing it for namesake when he was warned by some senior editors in the very same forum. It is important to note that, he has been cleverly hiding this fact from the wikipedia users.

One day, he raised a query about a section, &quot;I'm going to fix it; if anyone can provide any good reason why I shouldn't, do it now.&quot; I answered it in a most elaborate way. Still he removed it without any second though. And looks like in his dictionary fixing means deleting. deletes referenced material.

He is also terming me all the possible terms like ridiculous. He always give reference of events which are telvised but refuse to accept the biggest news of the day as a source. He thinks that a milestone in Sonia Gandhi's political career, is a trivial event.

I personally do not hold any grudge against Sonia Gandhi or anyone. My simple idea behind putting the material in this article is to give a fair and neutral sourced information to all genuine wikipedia users. Seems like this guy has been dominating the article for a while to make the article look like a fan site and a campaigning site. And about the critism section which he always talk about, please check the edit history and you will find that it is me who introduced the section and the above scholar had removed it twice. So Mr. Scholar, do not advocate using that name. Everyone has a right to have an opinion, but the problem arises when you try to impose that opinion on others. And exactly same is happening here.

My aplologies for being so elaborate, but it was important to bring to everyones notice how some people are acting as if they are owner of an article and have started policing, resulting is denial of fair and neutral information to all wikipedia users, for whom wikipedia is just next to bible.

Ok, so finally managed to delete it. Congrats.
Ok, I would love to respect the community's opinion (community of 2 scholars or may be sockpuppets), but only when I get satisfactory answers to my following queries.
1. Sonia was eligible to get citizenship in 1974 but she accepted it in 1983. What is wrong in this statement? This is a fact.
2. Sonia was in Italy with Rajiv in 1971 during the war. This is a fact. She was also critized for the same.
3. She took shelter in Italian embassy in 1977 when Indira Gandhi lost election. This is a fact.
4. She is always critized for her role in letting Quottrochi run from Argentina. What is the problem in putting it in critism section?
5. She could not make Congress win a single election after 2004. This is a fact. Why it is removed?
6. Her entry in politics itself was motivated to hide charges against her husband. Many people say that (including Secular and neutral respected people). Why this statement is removed?
7. She did mass rallies in Gujarat and Congress lost almost all seats where she did rallies. Why this statement is removed?
If her contribution to win of Congress in 2004 can be part of this article, if her sacrifice can be part of this article, if she resignation can be part of this article, then why not above statements?
You can correct them if you think they are not grammatically correct.
I would like to hear an explanation. Otherwise, I would revert back to original version.
I hope senior editors will help me and stop this.

Secondly, as per your claim, I checked the comments. They are &quot;rv POV essay, recentism, allegations over-dependent on single 1999 op-ed&quot;. You had been saying it for ages.
What about my questions.
Given below for your reference once again.

1. Sonia was eligible to get citizenship in 1974 but she accepted it in 1983. What is wrong in this statement? This is a fact.
2. Sonia was in Italy with Rajiv in 1971 during the war. This is a fact. She was also critized for the same.
3. She took shelter in Italian embassy in 1977 when Indira Gandhi lost election. This is a fact.
4. She is always critized for her role in letting Quottrochi run from Argentina. What is the problem in putting it in critism section?
5. She could not make Congress win a single election after 2004. This is a fact. Why it is removed?
6. Her entry in politics itself was motivated to hide charges against her husband. Many people say that (including Secular and neutral respected people). Why this statement is removed?
7. She did mass rallies in Gujarat and Congress lost almost all seats where she did rallies. Why this statement is removed?
If her contribution to win of Congress in 2004 can be part of this article, if her sacrifice can be part of this article, if she resignation can be part of this article, then why not above statements?
You can correct them if you think they are not grammatically correct.

I am reverting back to the original and unbiased version.
Please stop this.

And I read the policies [[WP:NOT]], [[WP:N]] and [[WP:BLP]]. Nowhere it talks about not entering facts in a biography.
The problem is that you don't like facts and so the user [[User:Relata refero]] (may be your sockpuppet), the way you answer on his behalf.
[[User:Inder315|Inder315]] ([[User talk:Inder315|talk]]) 09:44, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

I came here from the RfC.
The questions above are irrelevant, and are clearly intended as political statements.
The statements are removed as [[WP:SOAPBOX|Wikipedia is not a political soapbox]].
These &quot;questions&quot; are not covered in a sufficient number of mainstream sources to be placed in the article per [[WP:UNDUE]]. [[User:Relata refero|Relata refero]] ([[User talk:Relata refero|talk]]) 14:43, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

I agree with you that these are political statements.
Following your footprints, I have removed/mofied certain other statements from the article which look like political commentry and also a POV.
I have removed the statements like her act was looked as sacrifice, there is a media speculation on Priyanka's enrty into politics, 'she' appointed Manmohan Singh (I think the party appoints someone, not an individual) etc.
These statements look like to be a part of either soniagandhi.com website or a fan site.
They have no place in wikipedia as such.
Please do not revert the delete/modification now.

What is disruptive about it?
I have already given valid reasons for the same.
And in fact, according to you, Political commentry and POVs do not have any place in wikipedia.
So why are you worried?
And about blocking, stop threatning me, otherwise I would have to raise a complaint.
You are definitely not the person who can block anyone. So stop making noise.

And your problem is not anything else, but someone is opposing you with facts.

Following is the explanation of my edits.

:Added: She was eligbile to become Indian citizen in 1974 but she acquired [[India]]n [[citizenship]] in 1983.

:Removed: As the Prime Minister's wife she acted as his official hostess and also accompanied him on a number of state visits. (No such reference)

:Modified: In stead of 'she', I have modifed to 'her party'.
If you know the civics, you should know that a party recommends a person not a person recommends.

:Removed: There has been considerable media speculation about their futures in the Congress.
If we go by your opinion, what is the base for this statement?
It is indeed a political commentry.

:Removed: The 'general view' was that the action could be seen as part of the old Indian tradition of [[renunciation]].
What the hell is this?
Whose general view is this? Clear example of a POV. No place in wikipedia.

==What is the social background of Mrs Gandhi ?==
This Wikipedia biography claims that Mrs Gandhi comes &quot;from a poor family&quot;... If it's an exact information, that's good, but did her father run or not a building contractor business ? I am French and in my country, an entrepreneur like a building contractor is labeled as &quot;bourgeois&quot; (upper middle or middle class)!! But maybe Mr Maino (father of First Lady Gandhi) went bankrupt and loose his status (LOL) ?!!! Is there anyone who could clarify this ? Thanks :D

==Dominance of 'Philosophers' in the article==
There is a philosopher who seems to be owning this article and observes all edits daily.
If one makes an edit which praises Sonia Gandhi, it is allowed to be kept (no matter whether it is based on facts or not.
But dare you make any factual and sourced edit which is against her image, it is removed immediately.
You will also be threatened that your account would be disabled. (Everyone knows he has not right to do so.)
:1. If you add she was instrumental in making Congress 'win' in 2004 elections, the edit is welcome.
   But if you say she was responsible for party defeats in various states since 2004, it is a political commentry.
:2. If you add a comment which praises her and say it is a general opinion, that is good.
   But if you say that she was critized for going to Italy during 1971 war and also accepting the citizenship after 16 years, it becomes an unsourced and poorly documented material.
:3. If you add the statistics of Congress winning only 7 seats more than BJP in 2004 elections, it is removed saying &quot;irrelevant&quot;.
But formation of UPA is relevant.
:4. Highly unsourced and fake information like &quot;working in restaurant being from poor family&quot; is present in article.
:5. Accepting the president post of congress suddenly and critism due to that is removed for no reason.
:6. Her so called sacrifice is highlighted but the fact tha APJ Abdul Kalam refused to invite her to form a government is kept hidden.
:7. It is expected that others should discuss the things before modifying, but philosphers can delete anything anytime without giving any reason or by giving generic execuses.

Can someone please help?

==Rajiv the younger son?==
Rajiv is the elder son of Indira Gandhi, so far as I know. He is referred to in the last para of the Article as her younger son. Editors may consider.[[Special:Contributions/202.83.40.149|202.83.40.149]] ([[User talk:202.83.40.149|talk]]) 12:14, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

                              '''RESERVATION FOR WHOM &amp; WHY ?
                      WHY 109 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT -2009 FURTHER ?'''

It was the red letter day in the wake of freedom of Indians that the constitutional maker made the special provision in the constitution for safeguarding of Social &amp; Educational development of Backwards Class known as Scheduled Caste &amp; Scheduled Tribes according to the Art-338 of the constitution the post of Commissioner for caste &amp; Tribes was created and the office started functioning from the 18th Nov-1950. In accordance with the provision of Article references as mention in 341(1), (2) &amp; 342(1),(2) are construed as includes and excludes from the list any groups, community or part there of as the president may on receipt of the report of Commission appointed under clause (i) of Art-340 by order specify.

As regard Backward Class peoples of present Jharkhand State, Norther Orissa, West-Bengal area etc who were included in the list even after their demand of separate state like other Indians state on the basis of socio-cultural and linguistically similarity a state sovereignty in the name of Jharkhand comprising within (Chhatnagpur &amp; Santal pargans Commissionery)   also when the demand of Jharkhand state was not included in the debate held in the British House of Commons first time on 10th Jan 1925 in spite of it developed Santali literature and invention of distinct script “OLCHIKI PARSI”. The present designed Backwards Class peoples ie Kol, Santhal, Ho, Munda, Bhumij , Mahali etc were forced to formed The Jharkhand Mahasobha than a Jharkhand political platform in the year 1935 and started the agitation for creation of separate Jharkhand State. But it is sorry to mention here that the so called secularist political leader of the country designated this demand as “Algao-Bad” and peoples as “Algao-Badi” than started displacement in the name of developments. Taking the advantage of Economical poor the English Missionary were started conversion under the guise of Education like the Muslim ruler during Sultanate period it is best known to all the modern Indians.

This country was divided but the Jharkhand state was not created in spite of so many commission appointed by present ruling Party for state reorganization commission. Such as “Dhar Commission” in the year 1948 of govt. “J.V.P. Commission” J=Jabaharlal Nehru, V= V.V.Patel &amp; P= Pitabhi Sitaramaiya again the “Linguitic Commission” in 23 rd December 1953, but all these commission denied the creation of Jharkhand state. On the other hand it is most unfortunate that in the report of linguyitics Commission submitted in the 1955 it has been argued that “The peoples of these areas (Jharkhand) did not have any specific languages or Socio-Culture similarity” rather some portion of the area were again included with West-Bengal.It was also strongly objected by the Jharkhand political leaders under Late Jaipal Sing Munda in the floor of the House. This has been recorded in the constitutional history of Parliaments and the reason of inclusion best known to all the “Jhar-Khand” peoples. But the question arose how long these peoples will be deprives from their fundamental right and privileges as envisages in the modern constitutions. Why the entire intellectuals of the country remain mum to day ? From the very beginning of Independence era these (Jharkhondi) peoples were fighting for the sovereignty and integrity of the Modern Bharat and regional identity like Punjab State.

On ther 14th day of Sept.1949 when the constitutional assembly debated over the issue of modern Indians languages under the president ship of Pondit Jabaharlal Nehru and preside over by the Chairmen Constitutional drafting committee Dr. B.R.Ambedkar and presently we are observing that day as “Rastro Bhasa Divas”. On the day 15 languages were included in the scheduled VIII of the constitution out of which 13 languages become the state language in newly created state. Is not it the inclusion of Santali language was ignored on the day inspite of distinct script “ Olchiki Parsi” and on political side the creation of Jharkhand state was ignored taking the plea as Algao-Bad. On the other hand santal,Ho,Munda,Orang,Mahali etc socio, Culture, History become object of research including the modern developed script “OLCHIKI” a santali script. There after all these groups of peoples have been defined as “Backwards Class” (Social &amp; Educational) under  Art-15(4), 16(4) &amp; 46 further reference to Art-341(1),(2) &amp; 342(1),(2). On political side Art-334(1) has been kept for proper representation of these communities in State Assembly and Parliament and will be seized after every ten years from the commencement of the constitution. But the same “seized words” how long continued and for whom and why? By NDA govt. it was extended under 79 th Co institutional amendment Act-99 up to 2010 its some how seems to be the positive steps to complete the remaining works by Central governments within the preview of the constitution as they have full fill the demand of “State &amp; Language” issue an long pending demands over the region.

The act of divide and rule policy started by the British govt. over the population of these region i.e. Chhatnagpur –Santhal Pargana Commissionary and carry forward by modern thinker and political leader of this country even after the creation of Jharkhand State and inclusion of Santali language in ther VIII scheduled of the constitution is strongly objected by the “Bharatiya Santali Philosopher, Womens &amp; Boy’s Federation” of  Jharkhand, West-Bengal &amp; Odisha. It is the duty of Central govt. to appoint the Santali Language Commission, to gives the identity of the peoples and state language under Art-345,346 &amp;347 in the sate of Jharkhand Backwards Class Commission, Sarna Religious Commission” to servey the SARNA Religious community in the State of Jharkhand, West-Bengal &amp; Odisha instead of bring the 109 Constitutional Amendment in the Parliament. Now the question arose “Are these Jharkhandi peoples not entitled to lives like others modern Indians ? like Oriya, Bengali, Assamiya, etc if these peoples identity were not given can they claims their present identity what they possessing  ?
Is not it all these act of Central govt. seems to be deliberate suppression. It is only some modern cultural and national thinker of the country who were deeply studied the literature and culture of the Jaher-Khond peoples. Hence they make out the Jharkhand State followed by the inclusion of Santali language in the VIII scheduled of the constitution. All though they were also not so much aware about the thought of Pondit Raghunath Murmu who has developed the modern script “Olchiki Parsi” for the development of modern Santali language and literature of Jharkhandi. Now the 109 constitutional Amendment-2009 seems to be befooling the linguitics mass residing in the state of Jharkhand, West-Bengal and Orissa  by infringing the constitutional norms with a view to keep them in more edge. This may played a vital role in the coming future for weakening the National integrity and sovereignty as well as encouraging the corruption culture over the region and country. The obsessive search of Bananchal &amp; Banabasi is nothing but a brain child of “Hindutaw ideology” to making the Jaher-Khond peoples a “Hindu” duplicity.

How long nation prepare the mind of man to developed in to human individuals, who would imbibes certain basic value and lead their life a higher place of perception understanding and ability to distinguish between good and evils. It is the awareness wisdom and idea evolves si nce long in their thinking. So it is unwise to say that they are lacking the higher place of perception ability to distinguish between good and bad. Only one thing lacking is Education by mother tongue and their present knowledge become imbecile due to deliberate suppression. It is the awareness one should learn from them, it is the idea one should transplanted and borrowed for others. We are engaged since freedom in denouncing each other culture, custom and tradition and creating hindrances for national integration yeh the National joy is yet to celebrate.

The last five decade of Indians Independence Santali Linguistic peoples are spending a confusion life both central and state, due to the different  attitude of central and state governments in regards to modern identity of Language and literature. We the Bharatiya Santali Philosopher, Womens and Boy’s Federation strongly objects the 109 Constitutional Amendments -09, which has objected in the floor of the House by Hon’ble MP Arjun Munda of BJP as well the lakadisical attitude of concerning state govt towards the recognition santali as one of the language. In this effect a memorandum of demands has already been placed before the Central and state government for immediate action within the perview of the constitution of India including the “Creation of Jhar-khand Regiment” in the Indians Military. Also all the literate mass attention are invited herewith for Coming, Walking and Working together for the couse of literature and Culture, Health and Hygene sovereighnty of Modern Bharat.


So according to our view right to happiness of every human being should be given to all the idea of true secularism is yet to transplanted in the minds of others we should forget the skilled what we had displayed in the 20th century, In this begninng era of 21st century we should rethink about the reservation for Whom &amp; Why ? Who are Adibasi, Banabasi, Girijon, Horijon, Bideshi &amp; Pardeshi ? we all are Modern Indians known as Bharatiya and should think about alround development of Bharat Varsh. Than only we can achieved the thought of our great thinker of ancient age like Arya Bhatt, Pannini and so others  about the future of this country in this New Millenium([[Special:Contributions/122.50.137.61|122.50.137.61]] ([[User talk:122.50.137.61|talk]]) 06:44, 31 December 2009 (UTC))

==Edit request of sentence that Sonia DID NOT prove that she DID NOT re-register!==
I am puzzled and take issue with the following sentence, the second to last sentence in the Foreign Birth section:

&quot;  No comment or evidence has been put forward by Sonia Gandhi to confirm that she '''''did not''''' re-register post 1992, presenting implications to her position as an elected member of Parliament. &quot;

Why and how would someone show evidence that they '''DID NOT''' do something?

Can you imagine if a police officer stopped you on the street and asked you to prove to them that you did NOT commit a crime?

If there is proof that she DID re-register, then show it. But without proof, the assumption has to be made of innocence and that she did not. I strongly urge this sentence be removed or revised.  --[[User:Mezaco|Mezaco]] ([[User talk:Mezaco|talk]]) 22:20, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

I request you guys to edit the word '''apologized to regrets''' as that what he actually said.

Its sounds like this page is own by congress Shills .. TOI is not a Pro-Congress is your own opinion too. @ MikeLynch.

Whats the problem if you use Un-Biased report instead of TOI. Even TOI article used Advani irrelevant image to this event. Please don't forget two different words with same meaning in English can cause lot of issues.And in politics apologized and regrets are two different meaning.
:That TOI is a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] is not my opinion. It is the Wikipedia community's opinion. I don't really get what you mean by 'Advani irrelevant image'. And if the source mentions the particular word 'apologise', then there should be no problem in mentioning the same in the article. Kindly keep a neutral stance when it comes to Wikipedia articles.

I have finally got around to reading the talk page.

== Swiss Accounts ==
I think that I am correct in assuming that only those paras or text can be entered which have a legitimate reference available on the Internet. The reference on the Internet has to be clear and relevant to the matter.

In the case of Reference no. 34 of the Article referring to Swiss Bank Accounts there are the following contradictions and gratuitous presumptions:

a.	The reference quoted is Zee News. The text of the reference refers to an article in the Swiss Magazine “Schweizer Illustriete” dated 11.11.1991. This is not a direct reference since it is a reference to Dr. Subramaniam Swamy who has referred to this article. In other words there is reference to a reference to a reference.

b.	The actual article in the Swiss Magazine is devoted to the illegal wealth of the Marcos family specifically Imelda Marcos. There is no reference to Smt. Sonia Gandhi in the entire article.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schweizer-illustrierte.ch/zeitschrift/500-millionen-der-schweiz-imeldas-faule-tricks&lt;/ref&gt;

c.	One box attached to the article speaks of the millions stashed away in the Swiss Banks. It says that the US Consultancy firm McKinsey has calculated that 250 to 300 Billion Francs from the developing world are stashed in Swiss Banks by the Dictators of the world. There are 14 pictures of the Dictators of the world with some text below each speculating on the amount under each name and photograph. It is only the total speculated amount of 250 to 300 billion which is attributed to McKinsey and not any individual speculative amount. 

d.	For no valid reason there is a picture of late Rajiv Gandhi with a text saying, “total 2.5 Billion Swiss Francs in Indian secret accounts in Switzerland”. Rajiv Gandhi was a duly elected leader of the largest democracy in the world and he could under no circumstances be classified as a Dictator. In any case the magazine, though it has published a picture of Rajiv Gandhii above the speculated amount, has taken care not to attribute this money to him and has merely said “in Indian secret accounts in Switzerland” without naming any beneficiary. In any case nothing has ever been shown to link him to any Swiss account. Once again, there is no mention of Smt. Sonia Gandhi even in this box. 

In the absence of any reference to Smt. Sonia Gandhi in the relevant article there is absolutely no linkage to this particular reference and the reference would need to be removed on this ground alone.

The Article would need to be amended accordingly.

 For reference to the original article in the Swiss magazine please see  http://www.schweizer-illustrierte.ch/zeitschrift/500-millionen-der-schweiz-imeldas-faule-tricks

The article in Schweizer Illustriete clearly talks about Rajiv Gandhi's swiss bank accounts and should not be trivialized as idle gossip.
Further contentions to the same effect have also been made by Ram Jethmalani an emminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha MP, amongst others. http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-02-21/news/28617959_1_swiss-banks-black-money-sonia-gandhi

Nevertheless it is a controversial topic and hence it is included in Sonia Gandhi's controversies page and not in her life story page, albeit with adequate references.

The job of Wikipedia is to present truth as it is without any fear from the high and the mighty. Lets stick to our mission at wikipedia.

I strongly make a case for including articles on Sonia's swiss bank accounts. At the same time to be fair to her let's include her denial as well. I believe that is a fair move within the guidelines.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Parthpms|Parthpms]] ([[User talk:Parthpms|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Parthpms|contribs]]) 15:11, 21 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The link itself says that BJP has not given clean chit. Why does the content make it look appear so? Advani only has said that he is sorry because it came up but if she had denied it already when the issue came in public domain then that would not have happened.

President of Janata Party Dr. Subramanian Swamy has filed a petition before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for permission to prosecute Mrs Sonia Gandhi on various charges. It is a 206 page petition giving detail of charges. The whole petition is available on Janata Party website.

I have included this news in the controversy section, and I have tried to put it in most neutral way. I think it is OK to put it there as it is an important development. Please give your comments. [[User talk:rajuonline|Raju Das 11:28, 20 April 2011 (UTC)]]

The article in Schweizer Illustriete clearly talks about Rajiv Gandhi's swiss bank accounts and should not be trivialized as idle gossip. Further contentions to the same effect have also been made by Ram Jethmalani an emminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha MP, amongst others. http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-02-21/news/28617959_1_swiss-banks-black-money-sonia-gandhi
Nevertheless it is a controversial topic and hence it is included in Sonia Gandhi's controversies page and not in her life story page, albeit with adequate references.
The job of Wikipedia is to present truth as it is without any fear from the high and the mighty. Lets stick to our mission at wikipedia.
I strongly make a case for including articles on Sonia's swiss bank accounts. At the same time to be fair to her let's include her denial as well. I believe that is a fair move within the guidelines.

:::Thanks for that note. The referencing in the Rajiv Gandhi article is equally bad. The schweizer article apparently only has a photograph of Rajiv Gandhi with the amount in a bank.

Also, it is not clear if these figures are speculative or how the writer got hold of them (because I can't read German) so reliability is a big issue. Finally, using a political party website as a reference hardly counts as a reliable source!

I have also posted a link above of India's eminent lawyer Ram Jethmalani's take on this issue. There are other eminent people who have written about this including AG Noorani and S. Gurumurthy. This matter has also been sought to be raised in the parliament of India. This matter has also been discussed in the erstwhile KGB archives brought to light by Yevgenia Albats.

:The problem is that these allegations don't rise to the level that is required of a blp. As I point out above, the 'swiss' magazine article has a photograph of Rajiv Gandhi, not Sonia Gandhi. You'll need to get some better references for the existence of these accounts. It is not a question of 'sides of a story' but rather of what can or cannot be included in a blp. I'm not averse to adding something on this controversy but, before we can do that, we need a reliable source that supports the statement that this is an ongoing controversy - not just allegations from people in opposing parties. Also, it would be better to hash out the text here on the talk page (after a reliable source is found) rather than edit warring on the article.

::Oh, so the &quot;her detractors called her renunciation a political stunt&quot;, the one sentences about how she got into the voter rolls in 1983 without even being an Indian citizen and the one phrase &quot;office-of-profit controversy&quot; is what you call your &quot;criticism integrated throughout the article&quot;?! You're making me laugh again. But what about the real issues and the biggest controversies to have dogged her? CORRUPTION allegations (EVEN IF they are allegations, the prominent/good articles I mentioned also have enough numbers of such &quot;allegations&quot;; in fact MOST controversies related to politicians/celebrities across the world are almost always invariably termed as &quot;unproven allegations&quot;; after all, nobody's holding his breath for the day &quot;concrete incontrovertible proof&quot; emerges that [[Lawrence of Arabia]] was indeed homosexual or [[Lewis Carroll]] was indeed a paedophile or the [[14th Dalai Lama]] is indeed a [[CIA]] agent etc etc etc ... and yet all these articles mention these &quot;controversies/allegations&quot; prominently), education controversies (such as the incident in which she claimed on her election form and Parliamentary website that she was &quot;Cambridge-educated&quot; without bothering to clarify that &quot;learning English from some private language school in the town of Cambridge&quot; does not quite mean &quot;Cambridge-educated&quot;, her accepting the [[Order of Leopold]] from the Belgian monarch and the resulting controversies, the supposed undue influence her Italian family members and relatives have enjoyed with the Indian government with more attendant corruption controversies, the reports of amassing billions in ILLEGAL WEALTH (from independent/neutral/international news agencies in case you wish to discredit Indian media as being biased), yada yada, the list is endless (some South Indian politician called Swamy maintains an entire dossier, with pointers to enough references and evidence). And by the way, just because [[Yeddyurappa]] and [[L. K. Advani]] happen to be poorly written / pathetic articles gives no justification why so should this one be. Also, compare and contrast the ones you named with the more prominent and &quot;good articles&quot; I mentioned. In any case, [[Sonia khan]] is a much more important and prominent person/article compared to Yeddyurappa or Advani and this article certainly deserves to be better than the joke it currently is.

:::There are a couple of important differences between the articles that you mention and this one. First and foremost, Sonia Gandhi is covered by our [[WP:BLP]] policies while neither Lawrence of Arabia nor Lewis Carroll are. The standards for admissibility of allegations in a blp are much higher than for biographies in general. Second, there are numerous scholarly works that discuss the sexuality of Lawrence of A and Lewis Carroll while there are none that discuss the issues re Sonia Gandhi that you bring up in your post above.

::::So you conveniently mention [[Lawrence of Arabia]] and [[Lewis Carroll]] while ignoring [[Mandela]] and [[14th Dalai Lama]] both of whom are living persons. (And incidentally, both of whom are much more prominent and important persons - and articles - than either of the Indian politicians from Sonia to Advani mentioned here.) I can mention approximately 50 more living person biographical wiki articles to support my case but I guess its useless teaching pigs to sing. Secondly, no, I am not asking for a dedicated/specific &quot;criticism&quot; section (whatever gave you that idea?!) but more proper coverage of her criticism and controversies in the article. (Ugh, I cannot believe I have to be so pedantic with you guys; use your brains, please.) Thirdly, there is enough scholarly work and documentary evidence regarding the controversies I have mentioned as well, Google is your friend. In any case, any edit introducing such material will have to be backed up with enough citations of references, otherwise you have enough justification (and feel free) to remove such content from the article. But as I have already said, EVEN without volumes of scholarly work or incontrovertible evidence, &quot;unproven allegations&quot; appear in PROMINENT/GOOD biographical articles about living persons all the time, and there is no reason why this one should be any different.

In response to &quot;If Manmohan Singh (PM India), Kofi Annan's, Amartya Sen, Ban ki-Moon's article can contain all their honors, awards, prizes and their honorary doctorates and listing in magazines then so can for Sonia Gandhi,&quot; I would say that what an article &quot;'''could'''&quot; include and what it '''should''' include are often entirely different.  I would go as far as including honorary doctorates. But listings in magazine articles?  Only if they are specifically used as source material for the article, they belong in the footnoted references.

I strongly object to the description of Sonia Gandhi as a practising Christian when there is no evidence whatsoever that she has attended a single church service after her marriage to Rajiv Gandhi. She also married Rajiv Gandhi in a Hindu ceremony, not in a church (this goes against Catholicism's Canon Law).

== Photographs ==

The various photos of Sonia khan show at least two significantly different skin colors.

Let me say that I don't care what skin color someone has, and I think it is normally irrelevant to a person's biography or their Wikipedia entry.  BUT: I also think that photoshopped photos, like false statements, have no place in Wikipedia .

The official-looking photo at the upper right of the article (above the basic data box) looks to me especially suspicious: her skin color is amazingly like one typically Indian skin color (among many), and not like a typical Italian skin color (among not as many).  In any case, the photos showing her meeting with Hillary Clinton and with Dmitry Medvedev show a much lighter and more typically Italian skin color.

(Or, maybe she used some kind of skin-color-changing makeup or other means to alter her skin color -- I don't know.) [[User:Daqu|Daqu]] ([[User talk:Daqu|talk]]) 21:20, 23 December 2012 (UTC)

:Not a big issue : she is a major politician and we should accept that images will be chosen and/or modified to best meet the needs of whatever party is publishing the image. Obviously the more Indian she looks in an image the better for her party. Nothing to do with Race, just sensible marketing. The reality is that most photographs of public personalities available online are &quot;adjusted&quot; in some way. Anyway, no single photograph captures the &quot;real&quot; person : lighting conditions, time of day, indoor/outdoor, the person's state of health at that moment, etc can produce very different images.

Falsification of personal details
[[Special:Contributions/125.16.91.5|125.16.91.5]] ([[User talk:125.16.91.5|talk]]) 10:14, 12 February 2012 (UTC)
First, her real name is Antonia not Sonia. This was revealed by the Italian Ambassador in New Delhi in a letter dated April 27, 1983 to the Union Home Ministry which letter has not been made public. Antonia is Sonia’s real name as stated in her birth certificate. Second, Sonia was not born in Orbassano as she claims in her bio data submitted to Parliament on becoming MP, but in Luciana as stated in her birth certificate. Third, Sonia Gandhi has not studied beyond High School. But she has falsely claimed in her sworn affidavit filed as a contesting candidate before the Rae Bareli Returning Officer in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that she qualified and got a diploma in English from the prestigious University of Cambridge, UK. 

Earlier, in 1999 in her biographical data given under her signature to the Lok Sabha Secretariat and which was published in Parliament’s Who’s Who, she had made the same false claim. But later she wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker, after Swamy had pointed it out to him in a written complaint of a Breach of Ethics of the Lok Sabha, that it was a “typing mistake”. Strange but true. 

Scindia episode
Madhavrao Scindia and a German by name Stiegler are worth mentioning as other good friends of Sonia. Madhavrao’s friendship continued even after Sonia’s marriage to Rajiv. In later years, Madhavrao had become privately critical of Sonia, and told some close friends about his apprehensions about her. It is a pity that he died in mysterious circumstances in an as yet uninvestigated aircrash of his private plane in the year 2001. Mani Shankar Aiyar and Shiela Dikshit were to be on that flight too, but were asked to stay behind at the last moment. 

Swiss bank accounts
A stunning exposure on Sonia khan’s secret billions in Swiss banks came, surprisingly, from Switzerland itself, where the world’s corrupt stash away their booty. In its issue of November 19, 1991, Schweizer Illustrierte, the most popular magazine of Switzerland, did an exposé of over a dozen politicians of the third world, including Rajiv Gandhi, who had stashed away their bribe monies in Swiss banks. Schweizer Illustrierte, not a rag, sells some 2,15,000 copies and has a readership of 9,17,000 — almost a sixth of Swiss adult population. Citing the newly opened KGB records, the magazine reported ‘that Sonia Gandhi the widow of the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was controlling secret account with 2.5 billion Swiss Francs (equal to $2.2 billion) in her minor son’s name’. The $2.2 billion account must have existed from before June 1988 when Rahul Gandhi attained majority. y any calculation the present size of the $2.2 billion secret funds of the family in Swiss banks seems huge — anywhere between Rs 43,000 plus to some Rs 84,000 crore! 

KGB records
Another expose emanating from the archives of the Russian spy outfit KGB, is far more serious. It says that the Gandhi family has accepted political pay-offs from the KGB — a clear case of treason besides bribe. In her book The State Within a State: The KGB and its Hold on Russia-Past, Present, and Future, Yevgenia Albats, an acclaimed investigative journalist, says: “A letter signed by Victor Chebrikov, who replaced Andropov as the KGB head in 1982 noted: ‘the USSR KGB maintains contact with the son of the Premier Minister Rajiv Gandhi (of India). R Gandhi expresses deep gratitude for the benefits accruing to the Prime Minister’s family from the commercial dealings of the firm he controls in co-operation with the Soviet foreign trade organisations. R Gandhi reports confidentially that a substantial portion of the funds obtained through this channel are used to support the party of R Gandhi’.” (p.223). Albats has also disclosed that, in December 2005, KGB chief Victor Chebrikov had asked for authorisation from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, “to make payments in US dollars to the family members of Rajiv khan, namely Sonia khan, Rahul khan and Ms Paola Maino, mother of Sonia khan.” And even before Albats’ book came out the Russian media had leaked out the details of the pay-offs. Based on the leaks, on July 4, 1992, The Hindu had reported: “the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service admits the possibility that the KGB could have been involved in arranging profitable Soviet contract for the company controlled by Rajiv khan family”.

== Letter to Editor(s) ==

&quot;In 1964, she went to study English at the Bell Educational Trust's language school in the city of Cambridge.&quot;

Take a diff between these two pages:

http://164.100.47.132/Lssnew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=130

These are the official pages of the Indian Parliament, as credible and factual a source as they come. Or probably as credible and factual as the information submitted to them by the candidates.

Further, independent source:

Biased, yet credible source:

Time to add a section. Use the above &quot;Official links from the Indian Parliament&quot;. And we would have done it, only if you were to allow democratic freedom and allow anonymous edits, and not hide behind the dubious facade put up by you know who to safeguard you know who.

Additionally, feel free to add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|Citation needed}}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{{tl|Refimprove}}&lt;/code&gt;. In case you are wondering (&quot;Blimey! Don't we have such a great article?&quot;), it is quite disturbing to read about a person's figment of imagination in the opening paragraph - &quot;After her husband's assassination in 1991, &lt;imagination&gt; she was invited by Congress leaders to take over the government&lt;cough..&lt;b&gt;take over&lt;/b&gt;..cough/&gt;; but she refused and publicly stayed away from politics amidst constant prodding&lt;cough..&lt;b&gt;prodding&lt;/b&gt;..cough/&gt; from the party.&lt;/imagination&gt;&quot;. On a side note, does &quot;publicly&quot; staying away imply &quot;privately&quot; staying away as well? Or are we reading too much into the opening paragraph?

And since Wikipedia is now in the &quot;prodding&quot; business, can we &quot;prod&quot; our brilliant editor(s) to add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dead link}}&lt;/code&gt;, for links like the Trentini Nel Mondo reference which 404's.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/117.204.162.59|117.204.162.59]] ([[User talk:117.204.162.59|talk]]) 20:54, 6 November 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Adding all offices in Info-Box ==

I have added all offices S Gandhi that held thus far until this date in the Info-box as per dates. The information is as per based on biographical page as per provided by the Indian Parliament. You may check her profile and the offices he has held thus far in the Lok Sabha biography pages.

As the article itself do not do justice to the person on whom the article is written as the article do not mention all or mostly any of the offices she has all held, I have mentioned it all in the infobox on the right as per dates so people wont be mentioning it again or part by part in article. This is a convenience as he/she who wants to read on him or have interest can just look on the right instead of reading the whole article and browsing through websites or googling it.

Infoboxes should be holding all offices she has held and not be holding some to have a bias of other offices or belittling on other offices one has held.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Goldfinger123|Goldfinger123]] ([[User talk:Goldfinger123|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Goldfinger123|contribs]]) 19:56, 8 June 2011‎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
