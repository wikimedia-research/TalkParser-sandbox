== Karl Marx was nothing more than a depressed man. That's why he wrote the Manifest ==

I added the POV-Section Template to the &quot;Effect on Modern Countries&quot; section.  My reasoning for this was that it seemed like an attack on the US Government. Plus, that outside-link is horribly unprofessional, with the multiple exclamation points in a row, and the capitalized words. The sentence &quot;Communism, by any other name is still communism, and is VERY VERY destructive to the individual and to the society!!&quot; illustrates my point nicely. I can't think of any way to fix this, but if you can, go ahead and do so. [[User:Cheapy|Cheapy]] 02:39, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

: Do you have any medical evidence to suggest he was depressed at the time he wrote the manifest? [[User:Glich|Glich]] ([[User talk:Glich|talk]]) 22:48, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:: So how was it 'very very destructive'? Simply just saying it without proof of merit doesn't really strenghten your case beyond a reasonable doubt. People tends to be less credible everytime they 'cite' things without proof of research. I'll give you an example; &quot;Communism is very very destructive against the evil forces of Capitalism&quot;, if I simply say that - no one would listen to me, because I didn't say 'How' it is destructive or 'how' capitalism is evil. The idea is to cite 'how' 'what' and 'why' when it comes explaining your position, and also citing your source (also a link to a source would work)

== NPOV ==

This page isn't particularly NPOV, is it? The claim that Lenin and Stalin &quot;misused&quot; the term &quot;Communism&quot; is a Trotskyist or Menshevik assertion against Leninism or Bolshevism. (That most remaining Communists in the West today are anti-Soviet doesn't change the fact that it is a politically rife assertion historically.) --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]]
:Communism is a ''hypothetical'' '''classless society'''. As such, Bolsheviks and all so-called &quot;vanguard parties&quot; do not represent communism ''as described by Marx''. The same can be said for any &quot;communist&quot; group (including Trotskyists) that advocates anything less than the complete dismantlement of the state.--[[User:205.206.139.41|205.206.139.41]] 14:54, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

:While I agree that &quot;the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&quot;, Marxism in practice has never succeeded.  Marxism, or Communism, is an effort to eliminate this war between the classes and create equality among men while eliminating the need for or reliance on a supreme being.  As we find in history and illustrated so well in Orwell's writing, is that the state cannot function without the Party functionaries, which inevitably puts itself above the proletarians.  This then becomes the same situation as all other societies that have class warfare - the fight against, of which, is the whole purpose of Communism.  To me, this circular logic becomes illogical.

::Whittaker Chambers summed it up best in ''Witness'' when he said that in the 'crisis of history', men must choose whether God or Man can solve the problem.  In the macro view, Communism is a very young philosophy, meaning, only very recently put into practical terms and use (although I believe the underlying principle is used, and has been used by Satan since the beginning of this world as we know it) and it is already fading away.  Religion, particularly the Judeo-Christian religion has been on the earth since the dawn of time and is still very persuasive.[[User:Layne1975|Layne1975]] 05:21, 31 August 2007 (UTC)Layne1975

Better to rewrite than to whine, I have discovered. I'm not a Communist or socialist of any ilk myself, but I have tried to give a sympathetic reading of Marx and the early Communists as historical figures -- while also mentioning the tension between Marxism and the Soviet system as well as the critics of Communism. The interstitial quotes from the Manifesto are intended to convey its style as a piece of writing, as well as its political content. (It is to exemplify its style that I chose these three, rather than (for instance) its enumeration of the Communist program.) Of course, they include the famous opening and closing, in a little more context than the previous revision of this page. I would like to ask that those who edit this page keep NPOV strongly in mind. There are few topics in recent world history more disparate in people's feelings than Communism: there are many who see it as virtuous and noble, and many who see it as evil; many who romanticize pre-Soviet Marxism, and many who condemn the whole affair as a road to hell paved (at least at first) with good intentions. I for one am compelled by my education to admire the spirit of Revolution, though compelled by my learning to agree with the critics I mention in the article. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]]

:You state, and I agree, that Communism is a very divisive set of ideas.  You then say that people should keep an open mind about it.  That seems impossible when the nature of Communism, or its polar opposite, pure religion, are man's search for completeness.  If you're lukewarm about this topic, you'd better get your blood pressure checked.[[User:Layne1975|Layne1975]] 05:21, 31 August 2007 (UTC)Layne1975

:: I think your middle quotation particularly important for understanding how ''deterministic'' the authors believed history to be (i.e., &quot;communism&quot; would be unavoidable at a certain point in the development of &quot;capitalism&quot; and would happen automatically by the conditions of life of the workers brought about by the great &quot;capitalist&quot; monopolies.) These conditions were never reached in any &quot;capitalist&quot; country and other means were found of handling monopolies (e.g., unions, anti-trust laws). [[User:RTC|RTC]] 02:48 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)

The way this article is worded indicates that the author accepts that Marx intended a distinction between &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;communism.&quot; A textual analysis of Marx's and Engels' works shows that, at least as far as they were concerned, the terms were interchangeable. It was Lenin, in his 1917 book ''The State and Revolution'', that specifically distinguished between socialism as the transitionary phase and communism the terminal phase of the revolution. So with that in mind, if no one objects, I'd like to edit the article to read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The program described in the Manifesto -- that is to say, the policies the Communists of its day sought to implement -- is termed ''socialism'' or ''communism''. These policies included, among others, the abolition of land ownership and inheritance, the progressive income tax, and the nationalization of means of production and transportation. These policies, which would be implemented by a revolutionary government (the ''dictatorship of the proletariat''), would (the authors believed) be a precursor to the stateless and classless society envisioned by the socialists. The term &quot;Communism&quot; is also used to refer to the beliefs and practices of the Communist Party, including that of the Soviet era which differed substantially from Marx and Engels' conception.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is this concept of the transition from capitalism to communism which many critics of the Manifesto, particularly during and after the Soviet era, have alighted upon....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt;In other words, the dictatorship of the proletariat fades into communism when the representative democracy of the revolution fades into the direct democracy of communism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This will more accurately reflect the wording of the ''Manifesto'' as well as Marx's and Engels' other works. I'm also adding a link to the text of the Manifesto at the Marxists Internet Archive (available under the FDL).--[[User:Ewk|Eric]] 03:12, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== socialist ==

well actually communism is all about socialism it realy is just the idea that if you become socialist enough classes will disaper

::it is the human thing to do.

:::Socialism is a economic system. Communism is a government system.

::::Are you using these terms as they were defined by Marx, or just how you heard them used on talk radio?

:::::Socialism is the gov. system and communism the economic philosophy.. im not sure what part you are confusing.. what section are you referencing? marx was an economist.. if we are writing a ref. article its best not to address minor points as though they are sig. details... for the most part communism is economic philosophy, at least the way marx and engels wrote it.

:::::Im not sure what the relevance is. the first point is an interesting one, worth discussion..

As the words were used by Marx, &quot;communism&quot; refers to a stage of history which develops after the socialist stage has been lived through and served its purpose.  The proletariat's revolutionary overthrow of capitalism brings to an end the class dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and begins the class dictatorship of the proletariat.  The proletariat now sets about seeking to build socialism.  The task occupies an entire historical epoch of some undefined duration.  In the process of building socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat also nullifies the old system of class relations and thereby makes the class dictatorship itself redundant.  At this point the state can begin to wither away as the need for the state to suppress class contradictions has now ended.  As the state withers away, the new communist society begins to come into being.  Marx in his usage did not counterpose socialism and communism as one economic and the other political.  Rather, these were two separate stages of history.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/207.69.137.29|207.69.137.29]] ([[User talk:207.69.137.29|talk]]) 00:34, 16 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== how relevant is the communmist manifesto today? ==

can we still say that the motor of history is the class struggle?
if the classes polarisation of bourgeois and proletariat is not similar to our present society,
the exploitation of the many by the few is nonetheless still present.
another point is that capitalism was see nby marx as a necessary stade for the communist revolution.
if this revolution is hard to imagine nowadays, what is the next step?

I just would like to point out that Marx would reject modern ideas of socialism, labor unions, and so on.  He feels that these conventions are not what he wants, and they delay the &quot;revulution&quot; of capitalism to communism.  This can be found in his critique of these societies in the third section of his communist manifesto.  This makes Marx both an optimist and a pessimist.  This is only a suggetion...

I think this is an interesting link you all might like.  It is to a site with lots of public domain literature and philosophy, including the Communist Manifesto and works of Locke, Rousseau, etc. along with a really innovative hypertext linking engine.  Anyone can read and anyone can also contribute to the commentary of the texts on the site.  For instance, check out the Manifesto page: http://www.thefinalclub.org/work-overview.php?work_id=198

I might've posted the link myself, but I'm beginning to learn that such edits tend to be deleted immediately.  In my estimation, the commentary on the site, thefinalclub.org, is interesting as well as accessible to the average reader.  If you agree, feel free to contribute or post a link on the Communist Manifesto page.  Let me know what you all think.

== Changes ==

I've drafted a few changes for this page here: [[The_Communist_Manifesto/draft]].

I wanted to address a few problems in the current page. Mainly the excessive quoting (about 1/3 of the text is lifted directly from the tract, when it could be abridged), the point/counter-point regarding the withering away of the state (if we include one argument against Communism and its refutation, wouldn't we have to include them all?), and the final section about the effect on modern countries (these nations may have adopted policies supported in The Communist Manifesto, but I doubt that they adopted these policies *because* of the Communist Manifesto.)

I've written a part about its style, and a seperate section on its publication, translations, and direct influence. The new version looks shorter, but it's mostly because I removed the quotes I felt were superflous. What does everyone think? -[[User:Small Profit|Small Profit]] 10:35, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;Public education&quot; ==

I removed the reference to Public Education in Effect on Modern Countries because it is untrue. Marx did not advocate the abolition of child labour, only child labour ''&quot;in its present form&quot;'', he wanted children to have their educations combined with &quot;industrial production&quot;, a thinly disguised advocacy of child labour.

The clause also advocates the education of ''all'' children in public schools, leaving no room for a private education system.

:Quote:&quot;Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production&quot;
As of NOW the child labor in the form practised in early 1900 is ABOLISHED(We still have child labor in other forms such as Farm labor for childre of farmers is ussually allowed, also a lot of teenagers have part-time jobs and/or volunteer for community service etc.) therefore this plank is followed in modern western societies, i am putting it back(also see [[Trade school#United States|trade school]]).--[[User:Hq3473|Hq3473]] 03:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

== this is &quot;the communist manifesto,&quot; not &quot;communism&quot; ==

I've just finished a fairly major rewrite.  My removal of a few passages may be controversial.  However, I think they were clearly inappropriate in an article on the ''Communist Manifesto'', the document itself, rather than the ideology [[Communism]], which has its own article. [[User:DKalkin|Kalkin]] 06:34, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

== Jean Laffite? ==

This article claims that the original publication of the Manifesto was paid for by the pirate Jean Laffite. That is actually impossible as he disappeared &quot;never to be heard from again&quot; in the 1820's, decades before Marx' manifesto was first published. I am removing that statement from the article. here is text from Laffite's article. 

&quot;After being run out of New Orleans around 1817, Lafitte relocated to the island of Galveston, Texas establishing another &quot;kingdom&quot; he named &quot;Campeche&quot;. In Galveston, Lafitte either purchased or set his claim to a lavishly furnished mansion used by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury, which he named &quot;Maison Rouge&quot;. The building's upper level was converted into a fortress where cannon commanding Galveston harbor were placed. Around 1820, Lafitte reportedly married Madeline Regaud, possibly the widow or daughter of a French colonist who had died during an ill-fated expedition to Galveston. In 1821, the schooner USS Enterprise was sent to Galveston to remove Lafitte's presence from the Gulf after one of the pirate's captains attacked an American merchant ship. Lafitte agreed to leave the island without a fight and, in 1821 or 1822, departed on his flagship, the Pride, burning his fortress and settlements and reportedly taking immense amounts of treasure with him. All that remains of Maison Rouge is the foundation, located at 1417 Avenue A near the Galveston wharf.

After his departure from Galveston, Lafitte was never heard from again. Rumors have long circulated that Lafitte died in a hurricane in the Gulf or in the Yucatan around 1826. A controversial manuscript, known as the Journal of Jean Laffite, relates how, after his announced death in the 1820s, he lived in several states in the United States, and raised a family until his death in St. Louis in the 1840s. Reportedly at his request, the publication of the journal was delayed for 107 years and surfaced in the 1950s in the hands of a man claiming to be the pirate's descendant&quot;

== Sources for 'Influence on capitalist countries'? ==

I've added an 'unsourced' template to this section, as it cites none. Whilst the points made are interesting, several seem quite POV and the whole section has the appearance of [[WP:OR|original research]]. Can we get some sources for this stuff, otherwise it should be removed. [[User:SeanLegassick|SeanLegassick]] 12:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Right, [[User:Lordmetroid]]'s latest edit doesn't seem to have improved this situation, and reintroduced a spelling mistake I fixed. I don't get the feeling that this section is being edited well, so I think it should be moved here until sourced.

:Some measures recommended by the ''Manifesto'' are currently widespread in developed capitalist countries. In particular, most Western capitalist nations adhere to the following ''Manifesto'' measures:
:
:*Property taxes have, in effect, abolished property in land. Since you can be deprived of your land and home for failure to pay property taxes.
:*A [[progressive tax|progressive]] [[income tax]] system.
:*[[Inheritance tax]] makes the government rather than the family entitled to the property.
:*American law subjects people renouncing U.S. citizenship for what the government terms &quot;tax avoidance purposes&quot; to U.S. taxation for ten years after renunciation.
:*Confiscation of property without due process by various government agencies. The imprisonment of &quot;terrorists&quot; and those who speak out or write against the government in the United States(1997 Crime/Terrorist Bill).
:*The [[Central bank]]s. The Banks issue Fiat Paper Money and practice [[fractional reserve banking]].
:*Departements regulating traffic or communication, mandatory driver's licenses.
:*Corporate regulations, [[subsidies]] and [[Zoning]] laws.
:*Laws giving [[Trade union]]s special privileges in contracting and conflicts.
:*A universal free [[public education]] system and the abolition of [[child labor]] (in the form practiced in Marx's time).

:Many western capitalist countries in the past also [[nationalisation|nationalised]] [[communications]] ([[telephone]]s, [[radio]]), [[transportation]] ([[railroad]]s) and [[energy]] ([[electricity]], [[natural gas]], [[oil]]); the last group of industries obviously omitted from ''Manifesto'' due to relative insignificance at the time. In some countries these industries have been recently privatised.

:The private banks of [[Australia]] were nearly nationalised in 1948. Heavy inheritance taxes in some states of Australia were a half-measure towards the call for inheritances to go the state.

Any takers to turn this into sourced encyclopaedic material? [[User:SeanLegassick|SeanLegassick]] 13:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

::Great. This is definitely interesting material (no conservative am I), but given its contentious nature it definitely needs to be sourced. [[User:SeanLegassick|SeanLegassick]] 12:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

Unfortunately, the conservative diatribes on this carry a number of false analogies.  For example, the plank in the Communist Manifesto which speaks of a Central Bank is very explicit that this should be a state bank, no more, no less.  The construct of the Federal Reserve System is a bit more complex than that and involves quasi-public, quasi-private elements.  Conservatives will ignore this when asserting that the Federal Reserve is fulfillment of the Communist Manifesto, but then they'll turn around and maintain that the Fed is a &quot;private bank,&quot; which is itself another overly simplistic characterization.  But conservatives never logically reconcile this charge with the assertion in the Manifesto that a purely state-owned national bank is what's needed.  A logical discrepancy, to say the least.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/207.69.137.29|207.69.137.29]] ([[User talk:207.69.137.29|talk]]) 00:15, 16 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

It makes sense to reference the manifesto on the page for Erwin Schulhoff, but certainly not on the page for the Manifesto, since the Manifesto itself was not affiliated with, nor revised into the composer's piece (as in a derivitive work or a development like ammending a constitution).  Further, we are not including subsiquent literary works that examine the Manifesto and we are not including critiques of the Manifesto here.  It is only a page to inform a reader about the history of THE WORK itself and its contents.  Let's keep it on point.

&lt;em&gt;&quot;The famous final phrase of the Manifesto, “Working Men of All Countries, Unite!”, in the original German is: “Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!” Thus, a more correct translation would be “Proletarians of all countries, Unite!”

“Workers of the World, Unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains!” is a popularisation of the last three sentences, and is not found in any official translation.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

Probably the names appear in some later edition on the ''title page'', but it seems to me that starting the paragraph &quot;Authorship&quot; with ''&quot;Although the names of both Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx appear on the title page ...&quot;'' is rather misleading, as the title page of the first edition shown in the same paragraph ([[:Image:Communist-manifesto.png]]) contains ''neither'' name. It doesn't contain an author's name at all. Granted, the whole rather long sentence can be read as referring to the later 1883 edition only:
:''Although the names of both Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx appear on the title page alongside the &quot;persistent assumption of joint-authorship&quot;, Engels, in the preface introduction to the 1883 German edition of the Manifesto, said that the Manifesto was &quot;essentially Marx's work&quot; and that &quot;the basic thought... belongs solely and exclusively to Marx.&quot;''

== Authorship ==

In this section the view that the Manifesto was exclusively drafted by Marx is attributed to &quot;McLellan&quot;, presumably meaning David McLellan.  In his ''Karl Marx: selected writings'', McLellan says the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At a Conress in London in November 1847, the need was expressed for a clear formulation of the League's principles, and Marx and Engels were asked to draw up a statement.  Engels had already composed a draft after the June Congress, and Marx incorporated some of this material when he wrote the ''Manifesto'' in Brussles in December and January. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This more or less matches with my own personal understanding, which is that the Communist League asked Engels to draw up a statement, which he did, but which was rejected.  Marx then took Engels' draft, and finding its substance to be acceptable, rewrote it in order to provide a text with the necessary persuasive style.  I have modified the article to fit the passage from McLellan.
--[[User:Benwilson528|Benwilson528]] ([[User talk:Benwilson528|talk]]) 20:17, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

The statement on the current Wikipedia page is a gross misunderstanding of Engels' preface.  In it, Engels says that the basic thought behind the manifesto, that is, that the proletariat has been constantly put down throughout history and will never be at peace until classes are destroyed, was Marx'.  He does not say that Marx wrote the Manifesto any more than he did, just that Marx solidified the basic premise of communism more adequately before he could.

The Cardinal, singer with punk band [[The Blood]], identifies ''The Communist Manifesto'' as the [[Never Mind the Bollocks]] of the 19th Century, arguing that it challenged both belief and class systems with the same ferocious imagination. 

... the above is what i the cardinal want to put in this article under the influence section ...if you read marx's communist manifesto ... it has all the bollocks and energy of the work ''never mind the bollocks'' ...

my point is when you identify this type of work in a ... doldrumatic ... vapid ... sterile .... style ... it does not represent the work ... and is in fact an injustice to the people who created the work and in no way an encyclopedic reference ...

thereto ... the comparison i make between ''never mind the bollocks'' and ''the communist manifesto'' is the kind of comparison that marx would have expected ... its about the people and the developing perception of the street ... and the worker against the establishment ...

remember wikipedia is for every one in the world not just those who have been to university ... the cardinal The Blood

--I'm not sure if a quote from a band whom, no offence to 'The Blood', is not at the least--iconic--is really trivia.  It seems kind of like saying, &quot;John Smith&quot; from West Anytown, Carolina says that, 'The world is flat.'&quot;  Not a very important piece of info.  This particular trivia section doesn't fit in an encyclopedia such as this(IMO).  =Rust_In_Peace (Steve)

== Prefaces ==

Does anyone else think that this page should include info about, or at least mention the seven prefaces written by Marx and Engels?

== Page Title ==

Why is this page's address &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; not &quot;The Manifesto of the Communist Party&quot;? Any objections to moving it to the latter? [[User:Stephen MUFC|Stephen MUFC]] ([[User talk:Stephen MUFC|talk]]) 14:06, 21 February 2010 (UTC)
:See [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. Google shows three times more results for the current title. It's also been widely published under the current name.

How did this page turn into a critique of Marx and Engel's 'Communist Manifesto' and not reflect the actual text of the Manifesto as previously hosted? If I am missing the specific link please correct me, but nobody in the Party would ever condone the slapshod summaries made in the current sub-academic article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Venzen|Venzen]] ([[User talk:Venzen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Venzen|contribs]]) 01:22, 15 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Article a bit one sided ==

You know, being a lefty myself, I think the Communist Manifesto to be a pretty important and relevant document. However, I've heard others say different, and so it'd be nice to get some alternative opinions under &quot;subsequent reception&quot;. [[User:WMdcu|WMdcu]] ([[User talk:WMdcu|talk]]) 04:24, 26 July 2011 (UTC)

:I agree 100%! Looking through the Talk Page, I can see that the article's pendulum has swung from overly critical of the document to overly praising to the document itself. In its current state, it seems overly praising. Here are some suggested criticisms: 
: - Marx and Engels seem to be overly angry, and allow their anger to guide their conclusion--by violently overthrowing all existing social conditions by force. No other outcome is acceptable, they claim.
: - As they wrote, “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.” Then why do they have the naive utopian ideology that there is no struggle in a communism society?
: - The manifesto was written as a response to the industrial revolution and the perceived condition of 19th century western society. In the last 160 years (since the manifesto was written), the middle class has grown bigger, richer, and more powerful. Fukuyama, for example offers a worthy criticism in [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/print/134051 the Future of History]: &quot;Yet even as the great ideological conflicts of the twentieth century played themselves out on a political and military level, critical changes were happening on a social level that undermined the Marxist scenario. First, the real living standards of the industrial working class kept rising, to the point where many workers or their children were able to join the middle class. Second, the relative size of the working class stopped growing and actually began to decline, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century, when services began to displace manufacturing in what were labeled “postindustrial” economies. Finally, a new group of poor or disadvantaged people emerged below the industrial working class -- a heterogeneous mixture of racial and ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and socially excluded groups, such as women, gays, and the disabled.&quot;  --[[User:Lacarids|Lacarids]] ([[User talk:Lacarids|talk]]) 05:25, 18 February 2012 (UTC)
::Strongly agreed! There must be an enormous corpus of work critical to Marx that we could draw from - but I'm not a scholar in that area. 
::The Fukuyama quote seems very relevant, so I've added it - thank you.
::While I personally think your first two points are good ones, we'd need references. Have these arguments been made, in a notable way, by critics? Or are there other criticisms that are more worthy of being added? --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:17, 4 June 2012 (UTC)

== New section ==

So it is made out that Communism is argued as a non-predictive model by the point &quot;Commissioned by the Communist League, it laid out the League's purposes and program. It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and present) and the problems of capitalism, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.[2]&quot; - I and other in the party would argue that Communism is a model applicable a 1000 years hence and that Socialism is our preferred form of government in the interim. Who is saying these things? Not the Party, for sure.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Venzen|Venzen]] ([[User talk:Venzen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Venzen|contribs]]) 22:26, 4 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In addition to the original text of the Communist Manifesto, We would like to add references to Joe Slovo and the South African Communist Party to this article (which is currently in a sadly anorexic state). Communism is becoming more and more relevant and yet we have a sliver of the article that existed only 2 years ago. Who sabotaged it? Any opinions, please voice here before 30 June 2011. Nothing will be deleted, but the full text of the original added. Reasonable, surely.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Venzen|Venzen]] ([[User talk:Venzen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Venzen|contribs]]) 01:36, 15 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In the absence off any objections I will revert this page to the actual contents of the Communist Manifesto on 6 Sept 2012 in replacement of the subjective running commentary by the current commentators ~~  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Venzen|Venzen]] ([[User talk:Venzen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Venzen|contribs]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 22:08, 4 September 2011 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Of course there are objections. This is an article about the Communist Manifesto, not the Manifesto itself. You are welcome to make well-sourced and sensible changes to the article.

== Commissioned by the Communist League ==

I think using word &quot;Commissioned&quot; gives wrong impression on the origin of the manifest.
In Communist League &quot;mandated&quot; is used, for example, which is somewhat better.
From &quot;Commissioned&quot; people make some particular conclusions like quote below:

&quot;The phrase &quot;Commissioned by the Communist League...&quot; appears in the very first paragraph of Wikipedia's article on the Communist Manifesto...
...the common meaning of the word &quot;commissioned&quot; in this context is clear: it is generally accepted to mean ordering work to be done, usually for pay. Dictionary.com says &quot;to give a commission or order for: The owners commissioned a painting for the building's lobby &quot;Further yet, there is no conflict involved in the fact that Marx and Engels were members of the organization. There is no law against some organization hiring one of its members to build a new meeting hall... in fact I would think that they would usually hire from within before going outside the organization. Similarly, there is no law against some organization hiring someone to write a book. Why you seem to feel that this did not take place I do not know, but the word &quot;commissioned&quot; is pretty clear, and I read elsewhere that Marx was indeed paid for the work.I have not managed to locate a copy of the book cited by Wikipedia&quot;

I think the wording should be more precise.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/208.120.174.56|208.120.174.56]] ([[User talk:208.120.174.56|talk]]) 10:51, 21 September 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Cites vs. Common Sense ==

Fact tagging digests of something very well known (without cause) is picayune, small minded, and pointless. Digests of say the U.S. Constitution, or the Gettysburg Address, are not contentious in the way quotes from say the Book of Job or the Anglo Saxon Chronicle might be. The former are extremely well known texts about which there is no contention as to the original text so any misrepresentation of them, POV, pushing etc. can easily be determined by inspection and fact tagging should only be used when such a discrepancy has been detected. If the tagging I removed has such a justification, please restore them with a comment on what needs to be addressed.

== Awkward writing style in Reception ==

I've read through these sentences several times and find them awkward and nearly meaningless. There has to be a better way to express this.

''The revolutionary wave throughout Europe in 1848, which began in France in February and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America,[18] owed nothing to The Communist Manifesto, but within a year the revolutions collapsed.[19] Subsequently, traditional authorities found in The Communist Manifesto and its contents a good excuse for action against its authors.''

== Reception ==

There is a danger that this section is turning into a general section about Marx's relevance today, rather than a specific consideration of the work in question. Comments about what Francis Fukuyama or anyone else considers as defects in Marx's thought seem far off the point.
