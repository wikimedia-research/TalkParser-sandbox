== Pronunciation? ==

The name needs its pronunciation indicated, for English-language readers and for transcription into non-roman alphabets. ''-- [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|talk]]) 08:21, 22 April 2009 (UTC)''


== Coat of arms? ==
How it is possible that Flanders' Lion is the coat of arms of the Wallonia capital?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.12.77.240|78.12.77.240]] ([[User talk:78.12.77.240|talk]]) 08:53, 5 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The red stripe over the Lion of Flanders means &quot;Dependency of&quot;.
During the middle ages the county of Namur was sold to the Count of Flanders and he changed the coat of arms to reflect his new acquisition.
