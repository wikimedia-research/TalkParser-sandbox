==Speedy deletion of [[:گلاریشا]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:گلاریشا]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:گلاریشا|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:گلاریشا|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Andyjsmith|andy]] ([[User talk:Andyjsmith|talk]]) 10:10, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
