== Copuediting ==

I removed the potted history of the bicycle as it is not particularly relevant and is covered much more extensibvely in the linked article.

Can you cite a source for the following: &quot;the increase in the number of manufactures and riders of bicycles around the world created a collapse of the bicycle market in [[1899]]; the same time Canada Cycle &amp; Motor Co. Ltd, or [[CCM (bicycle manufacturer)|CCM]] was formed.&quot;

:I think that is a fair edit.  It doesn't add very much to the article for the subject is somewhat covered already by &quot;Around 1899 many smaller bicycle makers went out of business...&quot; This info can be found by doing a quick search on the museum of science and technology of Canada, search engine (type bicycle) or you can try cliking here.  (yup this is my source)http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/bikes5.cfm  --[[User:CyclePat|CylePat]] 14:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

== POV dispute ==

I wrote that:

:''The establishment of CCM arguably was to maintain Canada's sovereignty from the United States and other bicycle manufacturers. This is because, &quot;42 manufacturers formed the American Bicycle Company and soon afterwards announced plans to open a branch plant in Canada called the National Cycle Company.&quot; [2]''

I don't know if I can add such a comment.  It seems logical but, the first part is my opinion, therefore it is a type of POV, no?  It would far better to says, according to, so and so....  Anyone have anything on this?  (I would hate to have to remove but this may be original research...  or is it simply stating the facts?)  --[[User:CyclePat|CylePat]] 14:23, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

Note:  the [http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles15.cfm source for this information] states that CCM was formed to &quot;fend off the American incursion and control the domestic market.&quot;  (I guess that's a good enought argument.  I guess it wasn't all opinion. ha!)  (I'll leave the POV template their for a little while longer (until this is conversation is archived?))--[[User:CyclePat|CylePat]] 14:29, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:Don't read too much into that.  It's a bog-standard patriotic reaction to domination of the home market by foreign firms - there was a lot of it in response to the Japanese incursions into the car market in the 70s. - [[User:Just zis Guy, you know?|Just zis &lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px; border-style:solid&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Guy,&lt;/span&gt; you know?]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Just zis Guy, you know?|[T]]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?|[C]]]&lt;/sub&gt; ''[[User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD|AfD?]]'' 14:53, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

==Proposed move==
These articles and their external sites give &quot;The Hockey Company&quot; and &quot;CCM Cycle&quot; as their names.  Therefore I propose moving:
*[[CCM (The Hockey Company)]] to [[The Hockey Company]]
*[[CCM (cycle)]] to [[CCM Cycle]]
Any comments? -- [[User:Chuq|Chuq]] 02:55, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't have a problem with the cycle move, but the hockey one is more complicated.  I think that CCM like [[Koho]] and Jofa for example are all brands of The Hockey Company.  So I think that the brand CCM should have a seperate article--[[User:RWR8189|RWR8189]] 03:22, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== CCM (hockey) ==

I'd like to suggest this article move to [[CCM (hockey)]] which is wikistandard for titles of articles where there are two or more of the same topic name. I don't think the company's tagline should be used, but simply a single word that distinguishes this CCM. [[User:TheHYPO|TheHYPO]] 08:37, 16 September 2007 (UTC)
