==Requested move==
''This article has been renamed from [[In Your Mind (album)]] to [[In Your Mind]] as the result of a [[Wikipedia:Requested moves|move request]].''
{{Polltop}} - '''unopposed move'''. Also retained existing at [[In Your Mind (disambiguation)]] to retain history. [[User:Keith D|Keith D]] ([[User talk:Keith D|talk]]) 22:23, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

I have requested that this article be moved to [[In Your Mind]], which currently redirects here. The album is the only article using the title and so should be at the plain title. Disambiguation from the Built to Spill song can be handled with a hatnote.--[[User:ShelfSkewed|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''Shelf'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;'''Skewed'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:ShelfSkewed|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Talk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:01, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. Appears to be the only article titled so --[[User:Lox|Lox]] ([[User talk:Lox|t]],[[Special:Contributions/Lox|c]]) 09:26, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
