====Survey - in support of the move====

====Survey - in opposition to the move====
#'''Oppose'''.  What inconsistency?  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 17:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose'''.  Full names are better than only first names.  Why don't we move Seong Mina to just Mina while we're at it?[[User:Bethereds|Bethereds]] 20:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

===Discussion===
:''Add any additional comments:''

::And what do you mean by &quot;redirects were messed up&quot;.  Maybe that is something that should be addressed whether or not the article itself is moved, but what's wrong?  Double-redirects—not much trouble to fix them.  Copy and paste move problems and associated page history problems?  A better explanation of what you are talking about would help.

Please do not move this page back - there is nothing &quot;anti-korean' about making all Soul Calibur characters' articles match. There has been a discussion on this to name article titles after their most common name - and Han Myong's first name is not mentioned enough in the games. He is announced as simply Han Myong throughout the series. [[User:Mr.bonus|Mr.bonus]] 14:05, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
