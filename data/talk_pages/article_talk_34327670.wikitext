This is an automated message from [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]].  I have performed a web search with the contents of [[:Bamboo Basket]], and it appears to include material copied directly from http://www.bamboo-basket.co.uk/About.htm.  

It is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists. If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article. The article will be reviewed to determine if there are any copyright issues.

If substantial content is duplicated and it is not [[Wikipedia:Public domain|public domain]] or available under a compatible license, it will be deleted. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material. You may use such publications as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. See our [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright policy]] for further details. (If you own the copyright to the previously published content and wish to donate it, see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for the procedure.)&lt;!--This template located at Template:Csb-notice-pageincludes--&gt; [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]] ([[User talk:CorenSearchBot|talk]]) 16:46, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Bamboo Basket]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

A tag has been placed on [[:Bamboo Basket]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia for multiple reasons. '''Please see the page to see the reasons'''. If the page has since been deleted, you can ask me the reasons by leaving a message on [[User talk:WikiDan61|my user talk page]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Bamboo Basket|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you.  &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:WikiDan61|WikiDan61]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;5px&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:WikiDan61|ChatMe!]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/WikiDan61|ReadMe!!]]&lt;/sub&gt; 16:56, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

==Your article submission [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bamboo Basket|Bamboo Basket]]==
[[File:Information icon4.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

Hello Denniswilliam. It has been over six months since you last edited your article submission, entitled [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bamboo Basket|Bamboo Basket]]. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bamboo Basket|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note, however, that Articles for Creation is not for the indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia mainspace.

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bamboo Basket&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, click &quot;Save&quot;, and an administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt; [[User:HasteurBot|HasteurBot]] ([[User talk:HasteurBot|talk]]) 17:00, 29 September 2013 (UTC)
