==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Lizzy McDarren]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Lizzy McDarren]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please read more about [[Wikipedia:Notability (summary)|what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Lizzy McDarren|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Freshacconci|&lt;b&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;freshacconci&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:Freshacconci|&lt;b&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#B22222&quot;&gt; talk&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#2F4F4F&quot;&gt; to me&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] 22:50, 3 January 2014 (UTC)
