==RE: Your comments==
Hi Mrg3105. Thanks for you comments [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pumpmeup&amp;oldid=179156161 here]. Believe me, I don't feel in any way &quot;pumped&quot; or special by tagging articles. I'm sorry if you feel this way. What I do is try to ensure Wikipedia stays legal and doesn't violate copyright holder's rights off when tagging pages as such. However in this case I may be in error, though another [[WP:ADMIN|administrator]] also thought that the article was an unreasonable copyright violation. Nonetheless I invite you to re-create the aforementioned articles, utilizing the service statistics, etc provided the majority of the text is your creation. Things like what they may have accomplished in service, etc will make it less likely someone similar to myself will feel the article is unsuitable for Wikipedia. I'm sorry if I've offended you or caused you hassle. Cheers, '''[[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;Pump&lt;/font&gt;]][[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 10:13, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
:Don't worry, I always try to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]], maybe something you need to consider. I appreciate the fact there is often mounds of red tape around many things in Wikipedia, and I sympathize with many of the points you've raised. By all means, [[WP:IAR|ignore all the rules]] and make Wikipedia a better place, your contributions may not always be recognized positively but are appreciated and valuable. Happy editing :-) '''[[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;Pump&lt;/font&gt;]][[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 10:33, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
::These things happen. Most of the time people like us that try to deal with the flood of [[WP:VANDAL|ne'er do wells]] that want a cheap thrill out of Wikipedia or a pushing an agenda are worn down by the onslaught of such edits. Occasionally when someone such as yourself makes an honest attempt to add valuable information to the project imperfectly, we mindlessly trash their contributions - it's bound to happen and it's always good when editors raise the point instead of taking quiet offense to  it and never contributing again. The whole article building process is never helped by the fact we often have too many maintainers of the &quot;structure&quot; and too few actual contributors. I'm glad we've not come to loggerheads and I hope you continue making valuable contributions well into the future. Regards, '''[[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;Pump&lt;/font&gt;]][[User:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Pumpmeup|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;up&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 11:05, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

==[[Red Army's tactics in World War II]]==
Noticed your really good improvements to the Red Army tactics in WW2. Would you mind adding some references to them - which books you got the material out of, with footnotes? ([[Wikipedia:Footnotes#How to use]]). Otherwise it's very difficult to be sure of how good the information is, and it will be difficult to rate the article higher. If you need help, I'd gladly help you with how to put in footnotes. Thanks very much, and happy holidays! [[User:Buckshot06|Buckshot06]] ([[User talk:Buckshot06|talk]]) 22:41, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

Thank you Buckshot06. I'm determined to resist trying to learn about Wikipedia navigation and markup nad stay focused on writing/editing. As a result I screwed up my user page when trying to insert a sandbox. Its not that I'm technologically incompetent. I just have too much to read as it is. I take your point on the British Army, and the Soviet one. My other project is assisting with translation of the complete OOB for the Red Army for WW2. Yes, all 36 volumes of it. I am well aware of the magnitude of the task, and so I'm also trying to find a way to solve this using technology. Currently it stands at about AU$300 in software. After that is under way, I hope to substantially enlarge the entries in Wikipedia :) I'm also a member of the Australian part of [[RUSI]] (NSW branch), so can contribute to Australian and Commonwealth Military History.--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105#top|talk]]) 05:07, 22 December 2007 (UTC)
:If you're determined not to learn about markup, please at least put your sources in the text (Book X, page Y) otherwise I keep have to insert &lt;nowiki&gt; {{sources}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; all over the place and people will have to hunt for sources years later. The complete OOB? Do you mean BSSA - if so, please say so, and we can cite it - I assume you mean the www.tashv.nm.ru site, which I'm using myself at places like [[Russian 102nd Military Base]]. If you wanting to insert redlinks for formations, please check out [[Army (Soviet Army)]] and [[Divisions of the Soviet Union 1917-1945]] where everything is master-linked, as best [[user:W. B. Wilson]] and I can. The convention we're using is [[29th Army (Soviet Union)]] per WP:MILHIST guidelines, and for divisions [[5th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)]].
Great thought also on listing all the campaign Soviet style - if there's a central listing somewhere, that would mean we can take stock and see which ones don't have articles, as well as being able to link every written-about campaign/operation with the units that took part that already have articles. Tell me what you want me to do and I'll pitch in - but please PLEASE note your sources as you go, otherwise FA-quality articles take so much longer.

::G'day Buckshot06 (6 gage?!). Please read my comments in the Barbarossa discussion. I appreciate the importance of sources and references, but I think it is far more important to define and create a stable article structure first. My thinking is that a house is built by first digging a hole (a bit f destruction), and then erecting a frame (seemingly nothing there), and only after that does all the important stuff go in. Sources and references are really the detail work that much of the editing is concerned with in the same way interior decorating works (except in Wikipedia its incessant!). I would like to first define the article structure which IMHO currently sucks. I would like help, because a) this is really my first attempt at a significant article, and b) two heads are better then one, and the more the merrier :) Seriously though, I would like to talk to others and see what they think before doing 'major surgery'. There is much 'fat' there that can be taken to other articles (so I see others gradually getting involved as they discover bits of Barbarossa offered for 'adoption' over time :) I'm not sure why, but some of the German commanders and one Soviet are not linking properly although I added the 'von' and checked they are there (confused!). I also though that the Soviet Armies had separate article links from your lists, but apparently not.
I'm working from the scans I got from the www.pobeda.com.ru (I think). Craig Crofoot is already several documents into the thing, and did the Fronts and Front HQs.&lt;br /&gt;
here is what he says:&lt;br /&gt;
Gentlemen,

I am going to describe what is available on the Internet as far as the order of battle of the Soviet Armed Forces goes.  This is a general summary and not specific details.  If there are specific details that you know about, please let me know.

1) In the 1985 Robert Poirer and Albert Conner wrote ‘The Red Army Order of Battle in the Great Patriotic War”(Presidio Press) which for the first time dealt with the unit histories of major Red Army combat formations (its still available through amazon.com [http://www.amazon.com/Army-Order-Battle-Great-Patriotic/dp/0891412379]).  Although general in make-up and based primarily on the German Army’s Fremde Heeres Ost records, it did provide something.  In the 1990’s the authors attempted to have published a second edition, but due to its size and the publishers unwillingness to have two volumes, this was dropped (per telephone call with Mr. Conner). Given the fact of the huge amount of information now available from Russia, I would consider this severly dated material and would recommend acquiring a copy of the book only as a collector’s item.

2) From 1995 to 1998, Charles Sharp wrote and had published through The Nafziger Collection (http://home.fuse.net/nafziger/WW2_ARMY.HTM) a 12 volume series detailing the unit histories of the ground formations of the Soviet Army and NKVD during the war.  Portions of them were based on Poirer and Conner’s book, some on the original German FHO records, but then a new source was mentioned. It was the official order of battle of the Soviet Army as published by the Soviet Ministry of Defense from 1956 to 1990.  It was relatively unknown until the early 1990s because the Ministry of Defense had classified all of them SECRET.  The problem with them is they only detail the combat forces and not the support forces. Eastview Publishing originally was the sole source of them, but in my opinion because of the high price they were charging, several Russians were upset and began obtaining copies of them through their own sources and put them out on the Internet.  Igor Ivlev at soldat.ru used the version put out by the Russian Ministry of Defense to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the war, but this was poorly done since the Ministry only put out 1 for each quarter.  Two other sites put their versions out, one in PDF and the other in html (see below for links). In my opinion, download both and compare. &lt;br /&gt;
3) Approximately 5-6 years ago, word began seeping out of the Russian Federation that there was a much larger series of books detailing not only the combat units, but also the combat support and combat service support units of the Army, Navy, Air Force (including Long-Range Aviation) and PVO forces.  They were initially called for those that did not know them ‘Perechins” (Russian for ‘Lists”).  About 3 years ago, I was able to obtain a list of the books (initially being 36 of them).  They were described to me as being a list of all the formations and units of that type that were in the Operational Army during the Great Patriotic War.  For the Eastern Front, this covered the period from 22 June 1941 to 11 May 1945 and against the Japanese from 9 August 1945 to 3 September 1945, with one additional volume that covered the battles with the Japanese in the late 1930s, invasion of Poland in 1939, and the Soviet-Finnish war in 1939-40.
Over the last years, only bits and pieces came out, such as the Tank and Motorized Divisions, the low numbered Rifle Divisions.  My initially plan was to hire someone in Russia to see if the can obtain scanned copies of them so I can translate them and put them on the Internet. Well, that all changed on 24 August 2007.

4) On 24 August, through his source, Igor Ivlev posted on his soldat.ru website scans of most (one is missing) of these Lists. I have posted links to them below.  Although you do not need anything special to download them, you will need WinRaR to extract the files and Djvu (from lizardtech.com) to view them. It seems that they are appendices to General Staff Directives (which still remain restricted) showing every formation, unit, sub-unit, establishments and institutions in the Soviet Armed Forces and NKVD in the Operational Army during the war. The first one was published in 1956 and the last in 1973.  But it didn’t stop there.  It seems the General Staff continuously modified this list, changing dates of inclusion, adding units or subtracting units. This was done from 1970 up to 1989 in the USSR and at least two after its fall, one in 1996 and one in 1998. Except for the last two, most of these have been penned into the books.  The word I have heard, and no official explanation has been given, is that these were done for the veterans when they collect their pensions.  It seems they receive a double count for each day thy served in the OA.  For example, if a veteran served 45 days in the OA, he would be credited for serving 90 days. I am currently in the process of translating them into English and 
Below you will see the translations of the titles, the numerical order they were published and the links to the soldat.ru website for downloading. In addition, I am providing the status of the translations (myself doing the original translation, Michael Avanzini proof-reading and Alex Vasetsky doing final proof-reading and posting it on his web site).

::Thank you for accepting the invitation Captain Panda. Do you think we can do it by tomorrow? ;) Just kidding, this is a project that will take some time, and I think that aiming for [[high quality]] doesn't hurt. I have never taken an article to that level either, and in fact I'm a relative beginner in Wikipedia, but I know that this is a job for a team effort even if I was an expert. &lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate if you read my comments on [[structure]] in the discussion there and of course would appreciate feedback. I have a copy of the article on my home PC which I'm using because I destroyed my user page when I tried to install a sandbox. &lt;br /&gt;My proposed approach is to define the [[purpose]] of the article first, and then create a whole-article approach structure rather then write [[sequentially]]. I strongly argue that the article should be about the OKH operation and exclude everything else, including Soviet preparedness, decisions and reactions. They will be in articles that will cover Soviet WW2 operations, the structure for which I'm working on now.&lt;br /&gt;  The Soviet part which is usually lumped into Barbarossa is known is Soviet [[historiography]] as the [[Summer-autumn campaign of 1941]] (22 June - 4 of December), and is in turn composed of 13 [[strategic]] and 52 [[operational]] level distinct [[operation]]s. The reason I would like to 'untangle' this form a single Barbarossa 'lump' approach is because I'm also committed to a long term off-Wiki project of translating the entire [[Red Army OOB]] which is a first since the [[end of WW2]] that will give an unprecedented view of detail in this theatre. &lt;br /&gt;Eventually I hope the [[Eastern Front]] would be divided into eight [[theatre period]]s (and one [[Far East theatre]] period each with its own set of strategic and operational articles on distinct operations.--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105#top|talk]]) 20:44, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

:Hi Eurocopter. Thank you. I may be out of action from second mid-January for a couple of months actually so that would be good timing. My broad objectives are to add pages on the operations that took place during the Operation Barbarossa (wile redoing that Article) from Soviet perspective. To start with I will only use two Soviet sources for referencing. with time people will come and add where appropriate and chat (hopefully and without EW). I'd also like to help Buckshot06 in his research because it dovetails with my own, and of course Bagration is interesting. seems to me I'll be busy for the next few years :o)

== [[Discontinuous editing]] ==

I have added some more information and citation details on the film editing technique and removed the part on Wikipedia, which was unsourced, and apparently original research.I don't think the contention that it has been encountered by many Wikipedians makes it any less original research.

I'm not too sure of the best place to discuss such things, but you could try [[Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)]].

== Re: Consistency - state names ==

There are a couple of distinct issues in your comments, and I'm not sure which one you're actually looking for a solution to; so I'll try to comment on all of them:

One matter is the choice of correct state names.  Certainly, &quot;Russia&quot; is not an appropriate substitute for the Soviet Union.  The matter of Germany is a bit more subtle; in my experience, &quot;Germany&quot; is generally viewed as an acceptable short form of &quot;German Reich&quot; (cf. &quot;France&quot; versus &quot;French Republic&quot;), particularly as both go to &quot;German&quot; in the adjective form.  If I recall correctly, there was some discussion about &quot;Germany&quot; versus &quot;Nazi Germany&quot;, with the idea of using links of the form &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Nazi Germany|Germany]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; being preferred; but that seems more of a stylistic point.

Another is the use of shorthand state names to refer to the combined militaries of those states.  For example, we might write that &quot;Soviet troops captured the city&quot; or &quot;German troops captured the city&quot; rather than &quot;Red Army and VVS troops captured the city&quot; or &quot;Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe, and Waffen-SS troops captured the city&quot;.  I view this as a matter of style; giving the full collection of services in a combined-arms force on every mention would make the text unreadable, so I see nothing wrong with using the shorthand versions after the actual composition of the forces involved has been given.

Yet another is the use of ideological or political terms.  I would think that wording like &quot;the Nazis invaded&quot; or &quot;the Soviets invaded&quot; ought to be avoided in formal writing regardless (although the latter form is a somewhat popular shorthand for &quot;the Soviet forces invaded&quot;).  As far as I know, though, this isn't too much of an issue in practice.

More generally, if you're looking to establish common conventions on terminology, the best place to have such a discussion would be at [[WT:WWII]]. [[User:Kirill Lokshin|Kirill]] 22:11, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
::Yes there are several issues as you point out, and in university I was taught to call things their proper names. I know you are also a historian, and know that there are many Germanies, and the Austrians resented all of them :o) Given the number of German speaking Austrians that served in the Wehrmacht, never mind other nationalities, it seems to me that historical pedantry is called for if only to educate the reader. The problem I have with services is that the Soviet OOBs state which units and Services participated in a given operation. I can not say that the 16 Air Army was part of the Red Army since it was not. As it stands now the VVS doesn't even have a page of its own! After all you don't see the RAF lumped with the British Army? Again an issue of consistency.--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105#top|talk]]) 22:33, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, that's fine.

== Reply ==
First of all, the meeting's purpose (the meeting itself being one sided decission of Hitler - he had not been asked by Finnish to come and &quot;say hello&quot; to Marshal Mannerheim) was not to make plans with Germany on how to &quot;take out Leningrad&quot;. That the Finnish unit which was eventually created was involved in clashes agains't Leningrad's supply route is irrelevant. The unit's purpose was to patrol waters of Lake Ladoga, which was strategically important area of water for Finnish because of it flanked both Karelian Istmush and East Karelia, not to attack agains't Leningrad. Neither was Finland in an &quot;alliance with ''Nazis''&quot;. The fact that the unit was involved in clashes agains't Soviet forces supplying Leningrad by Lake Ladoga is and was already noted in the article with references - there is no right to talk about Finnish alliance with &quot;Nazis&quot; and include Finland in the box. --[[User:Kurt Leyman|Kurt Leyman]] ([[User talk:Kurt Leyman|talk]]) 23:52, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
: Kurt, I didn't ask for your POV on what Finland's intentions were. I asked if the meeting to which the article referred took place or not since you deleted the reference to it. Also, are you saying that Finland did not have a formal alliance with German Reich during WWII?--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105#top|talk]]) 00:16, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
This has nothing to do with my &quot;PoV&quot;. &quot;I asked if the meeting to which the article referred took place or not since you deleted the reference to it.&quot; It did, as I already said - and the meeting itself is irrelevant, especially since the user who added information regarding it did not use the references he listed for it - he copied them from elsewhere in the article to mix something the references are relevant with something they are not. Information regarding the unit was already noted in the article and still is. If you would read the article carefully you would see this yourself. &quot;Also, are you saying that Finland did not have a formal alliance with German Reich during WWII?&quot; Yes, there was no alliance with Germany and Finland. --[[User:Kurt Leyman|Kurt Leyman]] ([[User talk:Kurt Leyman|talk]]) 00:22, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

I do not have to do that - the article does not claim such and did not claim such until someone decided to do some &quot;intriguing&quot; edits.

:I just think its a point worth making. Someone less informed can easily assume that Finland due to its proximity and taking the offensive with the Wehrmacht troops DID participate in the siege.

I see little reasoning behind writing &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; under Germany (would be the same if we would be talking about any other country - and its military). That is not something rare in Wikipedia battle articles. As for Finland's involvement in the siege; Finnish Army did not siege the city; there was no shelling or attacks agains't the city. Finnish troops were only tens of kilometers from Leningrad (with Germans closing in from the East) when Marshal Mannerheim ordered the advance to be stopped at Finland's old borders. 
Leningrad was within range of artillery from Finland's border - yet there was no shelling nor attacks; Finnish did not seek to attack Leningrad.

The small Finnish naval forces on Lake Ladoga were involved in clashes agains't Leningrad supply route on the lake - which should come as no suprise since it was to patrol its waters. The Italian naval unit on the other hand had been specifically tasked for attacking agains't Leningrad (although the Italian unit did not exist for long - its few vessels were turned over to Finnish by the end of 1942 - the vessels being used to strenghten Finland's small navy). --[[User:Kurt Leyman|Kurt Leyman]] ([[User talk:Kurt Leyman|talk]]) 01:35, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
:You know, I don't really want to argue with you. The trouble is that this is an open edit encyclopaedia, and this means that the next time someone decided to write Finland into the siege, you will have to undo again, and and again, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
As for Wehrmacht, you are right. It should say Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine, as well as Waffen-SS. Its a point of factual accuracy and not common sloppiness of using the easies common term. As producers/editors of historical information we should be more quality-mined then the reader who may be a just a school kid doing homework. The school kid will have no idea which part of Germany was at the siege. In fact he will go to [[Germany]] and it will take a long time to reach Wehrmacht through [[History of Germany]], [[History of Germany in WWII]], etc. So why not save the time and just say what it is supposed to say, that [[Wehrmacht]] troops were conducting the siege with support of the [[Luftwaffe]] and [[Kriegsmarine]]?--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] ([[User talk:Mrg3105#top|talk]]) 01:46, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

==Re: [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Siege of Leningrad]]==
Dear [[User:Mrg3105]],

Thank you for your efforts. However your actions in transplanting sentences and paragraphs from [[Siege of Leningrad]] to [[St. Petersburg]] makes unnecessary duplications and does not help neither of the articles. [[Siege of Leningrad]] is actively undergoing a major edit, and the template is clearly visible, please be thoughtful. 

1st: you are disrupting the ongoing flow of edits and updates by creating edit conflicts (see the template).

2nd: you changed the language so that your text stated &quot;Leningrad Metro operated in the 1930s&quot; which is wrong. 

I was born and lived in the city for decades. Please let me do some work without edit conflicts with you and without wasting time for corrections of your  unnecessary mistakes and duplications. Study both articles in their entirety for several days, also study the city and make a few visits there to learn more newest information in museums, libraries, universities, and historic sites there, then think what can be done to make Wikipedia better.


Thank you anyway, your kind support and cooperation may be highly appreciated at the right time.

The duplication was that you had inserted the same sentence in the Leningrad/StPetersberg article also about the Metro, so I deleted a one sentence paragraph. Have a look in the history. The [[Siege of Leningrad]] is a large article with is going to get larger because more detail on military operations will be added, including to the timeline which currently lacks this. There is a larger project in ProjectsMilitaryHistory that will be reviewing all of the  Red Army operations in the war and Siege of Leningrad will be one. Your post-siege content will just get lost in it, and is also completely irrelevant.--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 12:41, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

Secondly you need to talk about all sorts of approaches to the writing and editing this. You keep insisting on devoting a huge amount of content to Finnland, bu they had almost nothing to do with the siege. They will be covered in other operations of their participation in the war. I can guarantee that because I'm the one who is working on about 200 articles dealing with these operations of which the siege of Leningrad is one.

Hmmm, Buckshot06, I had my new year in September since I'm not even on the solar calendar. I'm sure you wouldn't wait 9 months.

==Please stop manually editing categories==
Categories are added to by adding the category, for example, [[:Category:Divisions of the Soviet Union]] to the bottom of an existing page, not by editing the actual category page. What you've been doing just means that Kirill, for example, had to clean up the Russian military history articles needing attention to structure - [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Russian_and_Soviet_military_history_articles_needing_attention_to_structure&amp;action=history here] and I actually added [[Siege of Leningrad]] to the article list in there by editing the project banner template - the &lt;nowiki&gt; {{WPMILHIST}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; banner that one copies the B-class listing into.

:Ok, so I can add all these historical wars as redlinks in the Military history of Russia articles (5), but how will the members of the project know? The bot will pick them out?

::Hmm? Are you trying to keep track of redlinks somewhere?  If they're articles that need to be created, [[Template:WPMILHIST Announcements/Russian and Soviet military history]] would be the most obvious place, I think. [[User:Kirill Lokshin|Kirill]] 05:53, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

There are a few problems with the way categories and articles were set up, which is why I didn't find them. Of course I should have looked in the categories in hind sight.&lt;br /&gt;
For example the use of the dash (-). There is a difference between Pskov-Novgorod Campaigns and Novgorod - Livonian border conflicts. One signifies a single entity much in the way a double name is written, while the other signifies separation/opposition. The names used are also different to the Russian historiography. In any case, I'm glad there is so much there, so I will look it over at some other time, and fill in the blanks where I find them.--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 06:27, 29 December 2007 (UTC)--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 06:27, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

==149th Guards MRR==
Thanks for this Mrg. However notes to me should go at my talk page, not just randomly scattered around. Article talk pages are for general discussion on improving that article. Also, I've never heard of the [[Belorussian Strategic Direction]] - ever. Glantz doesn't list any more than the three directions at the start of the war, the Northwestern under Voroshilov, the Western under Timoshenko, and the Southwestern under Budyonny &amp; Timoshenko, plus the Far Eastern in '45 under Vasilevsky. Do you have other sources backing the existence of the BSD up?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Buckshot06|Buckshot06]] ([[User talk:Buckshot06|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Buckshot06|contribs]]) 23:09, 29 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Ok, should I remove the note re 149 from the 201st division and put it in your talk?&lt;br /&gt;
I took the Belorussian direction from here http://www.genstab.ru/gpw_fronts.htm. I just wanted to do one that was small and less involved with MDs to get some practice. It was a very short lived one, but there is another source I added that suggests it existed in 1941 along with the Kiev Strategic Direction. However the Kiev one was not reformed, and instead there is the Ukrainian one.--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 23:25, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

==Theatres and directions==
::Don't remove anything. That's not the convention - any talk page comments remain for all time. But put all future questions to me on my talk page. Please go ahead and add the Strategic Directions, but initially why don't you stick to the well-known four above - I've, again, never heard of the Kiev SD - was that another name for the Southwestern SD? Um, taking a look at your source now (and please list that webpage, rather than books listed in the page that you do not appear to have directly used), they do not seem to be [[command (military formation)|formation]]s, instead being [[Theatre of Military Operations|theatres of military operations]] - most notably, they don't have commanders or staff - they're just big areas of land over which combat took place. [[User:Buckshot06|Buckshot06]] ([[User talk:Buckshot06|talk]]) 23:38, 29 December 2007 (UTC)
:::I though that since I did provide additional information about the unit, that this was ok. Again, a part of learning process. &lt;br /&gt;Well, I have never heard of the Kiev Strategic direction either until this morning because I never read that book to Chapter 6 where it gets a mention in one sentence. Given what happened at Kiev in 1941, I'm not surprised. Keep in mind that the term 'direction' can be used in operational and tactical sense also, so you are right and caution is required. However Genshtab site is generally pretty good for data. I don't have permission to reproduce their data yet, so I have not added the site to sources (or provided the commanding officers). The wording is Theatre, but the actual meaning is a direction rather then a Theatre. --&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 23:49, 29 December 2007 (UTC)
::::As luck would have it, just heard that Genshtab got the info from this site http://istoria.svyt.net/rus/sssr/velikayavoina/21/ which is a general site on Russian and Soviet history--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 00:18, 30 December 2007 (UTC)
::::Ok, I have done more research. The source for the many thetres is a first for the author who apparently previously specialised in books on food and 'politico-military' subjects. Only 2000 copies were printed, so I am unlikely to get a hold of one since they look to be collectors items. However the book is not a real book, but rather statistical extracts. It seems the author was confused about the difference between TVDs and SDs. I have fixed the page, and will go on from there.--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 05:06, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

==[[VDV]]==

There is already a separate article for the VDV. I'm moving your new information there, if you don't mind. Permissions? I've never heard of that site before. Cheers [[User:Buckshot06|Buckshot06]] ([[User talk:Buckshot06|talk]]) 01:51, 30 December 2007 (UTC)
:I wasn't sure if that was alright since this is RF page, and not Soviet Army. Ok, I will ask his permission. I have had to ask him questions before, but never permission. Aside from Chobitok, he is probably one of the most authoritative Russian sites, and his is a vehement opponent of 'Suvorov'. I will ask about the Belorussian TVD which is really a strategic direction. My problem is that I don;t have the book the other site provides as a source, but it is a recent one, so there are two options: it is a good source based on recent declassified research, or b)it has no credibility and is a complete invention. Given how GPW is viewed in Russia the and the amount of new material appearing every year about the GPW I would tend to go for a), but one never knows. If I can't confirm from Veremeyev, and he can't confirm, it will have to change from TVD to SD.&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of bad sources, I have just located an '''unverified''' anonymous source for OOB of the RF Army in Chechnya. It is similar to yours, but adds some units, and particularly the SpetzNaz and Internal Troops. Do you want it?--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 02:30, 30 December 2007 (UTC)
:The VDV? Same force, just changed the sign at Stab VDV somewhere in Moscow, and I'm not sure even if they've done that! Chechniya? If it's a Second War listing, yes, especially if recent. I, as far as I know, haven't done a full Chechniya OB - the [[North Caucasus Military District]] listing is very incomplete.

::Its just that for some categories you made separate pages, so I thought I would ask.&lt;br /&gt; The list is for current, and I unduly assumed that you maintained that. Many units are from other MDs.--&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Edwardian Script ITC&quot; size=&quot;5&quot;&gt; [[User:mrg3105|mrg3105]][[User talk:mrg3105|mrg3105]] &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; 02:54, 30 December 2007 (UTC)
