===Your edits to [[October 22]]===
Dear [[User:155.247.222.114|155.247.222.114]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px]]
Some of your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=October_22&amp;diff=212401417&amp;oldid=211983394 edits] on the page 
[[October 22]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: The person you added doesn't seem to have a Wikipedia page.
If the page exists, check that you've spelled and capitalized the name the same way as the article, and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you [[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-PseudoBot1 --&gt; [[User:PseudoBot|PseudoBot]] ([[User talk:PseudoBot|talk]]) 18:06, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop your disruptive editing{{#if:October 22|, such as the edit you made to [[:October 22]]}}. If your [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] continues, you will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. {{#if:|{{{2}}}|}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism3 --&gt; [[User:J.delanoy|&lt;font color=&quot;#ffe800&quot;&gt;J.d&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00ff00&quot;&gt;ela&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;noy&lt;/font&gt;]][[User Talk:J.delanoy|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gabs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/J.delanoy|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 18:09, 14 May 2008 (UTC)
