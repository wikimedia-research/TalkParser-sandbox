==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Jlh-Inc]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Jlh-Inc]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Jlh-Inc|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Fauzan|&lt;font color=&quot;2F4F4F&quot;&gt;Fauzan&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup style=&quot;margin-left:+0.5ex&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fauzan#top|&lt;font color=&quot;BDB76B&quot;&gt;✆ talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-4.6ex&quot;&gt;[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|&lt;font color=&quot;BDB76B&quot;&gt;✉ mail&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 12:13, 14 December 2014 (UTC)

== Ways to improve Jlh-Inc ==

Hi, I'm Lstanley1979. NokoTidene, thanks for creating [[Jlh-Inc]]!

I've just tagged the page, using our [[Wikipedia:Page Curation/Help|page curation]] tools, as having some issues to fix. Hi - this is the English Wikipedia, and articles must be in English. Please use your own version of Wikipedia for articles written in other languages.

The tags can be removed by you or another editor once the issues they mention are addressed. If you have questions, you can leave a comment on [[User talk:Lstanley1979|my talk page]]. Or, for more editing help, talk to the volunteers at [[WP:TEAHOUSE|the Teahouse]]. [[User:Lstanley1979|LS1979]] ([[User talk:Lstanley1979|talk]]) 12:14, 14 December 2014 (UTC)
== Speedy deletion nomination of Jonas Lindgren Hostvedt ==

Hello NokoTidene,

I wanted to let you know that I just tagged [[Jonas Lindgren Hostvedt]] for deletion, because it seems to be [[Wikipedia:Promotion|promotional]], rather than an encyclopedia article.

If you feel that the article shouldn't be deleted and want more time to work on it, you can &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title={{urlencode:Talk:Jonas Lindgren Hostvedt}}&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+page+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+ contest this deletion]'''&lt;/span&gt;, but please don't remove the speedy deletion tag from the top.

You can leave a note on [[User_talk:Kges1901|my talk page]] if you have questions. [[User:Kges1901|Kges1901]] ([[User talk:Kges1901|talk]]) 12:16, 14 December 2014 (UTC)
