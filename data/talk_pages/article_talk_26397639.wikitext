I am an employee of EditMe, and have created this page because I believe it belongs here. I have tried my best to be unbiased and factual. 

I understand that my employment status may reflect a conflict of interest and have taken the following steps to ensure impartiality:
1. I have purposefully avoided linking directly to the company page itself. 
2. I have reached out to other members of the wikipedia community that I know, who are not employees of EditMe, to provide further revisions and references to support this article.

If there is a problem with this article, let's please revise it together as a community. Please refrain from deleting it, as it has significant impact on how this article is represented on other pages such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software
