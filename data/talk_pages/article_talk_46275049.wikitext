==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Shirshendu das]]==
[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Shirshendu das]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please read more about [[Wikipedia:The answer to life, the universe, and everything|what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Shirshendu das|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Lakun.patra|Lakun.patra]] ([[User talk:Lakun.patra|talk]]) 04:17, 31 March 2015 (UTC)

== March 2015 ==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not write or add to an article about yourself, as you apparently did at [[:Shirshendu das]]. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]] is ''strongly'' discouraged â€“ see our guideline on [[WP:AUTOBIO|writing autobiographies]]. If you create such an article, it may be deleted. If what you have done in life is genuinely notable and can be verified according to our policy for [[WP:PEOPLE|articles about living people]], someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]]). If you wish to add to an existing article about yourself, please propose the changes on its talk page. Please understand that this is an encyclopedia and not a personal web space or social networking site. If your article has already been deleted, please see: [[Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?|Why was my page deleted?]], and if you feel the deletion was an error, please discuss it with the deleting administrator. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Lakun.patra|Lakun.patra]] ([[User talk:Lakun.patra|talk]]) 04:19, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
