== what about Gandhi? ==

Doesn't GANDHI count?

== Category? ==

Doesn't it make sense to make this into a Category page instead of an article? [[User:Siddheshp|Siddheshp]] ([[User talk:Siddheshp|talk]]) 06:01, 1 October 2011 (UTC)
:I agree with [[User:Siddheshp]]. I recommend for the deletion of this page and there already exists a category page on Indian Social Reformers. Akhil Bharathan 20:00, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

== sort ==

I am sorting them in ascending order. If someone does not like that, (for example if you want gandhi ji at the top and so on) please give your input here instead of a blanket revert. Thank you sho mush[[User:FreeatlastChitchat|FreeatlastChitchat]] ([[User talk:FreeatlastChitchat|talk]]) 05:37, 30 December 2014 (UTC)
