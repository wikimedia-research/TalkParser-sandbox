== Image:Normal pleasprem006.jpg ==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Normal pleasprem006.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Fair use criteria|first fair use criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:Image:Normal pleasprem006.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, '''without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:Normal pleasprem006.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].  If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you. [[User:Yamla|Yamla]] 17:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
==Orphaned non-free media (Image:Sid-vicious.jpg)==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Sid-vicious.jpg]]'''. The media description page currently specifies that it is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, it is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the media was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that media for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that all non-free media not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Orphaned --&gt; [[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 06:19, 24 August 2007 (UTC)


==Disputed fair use rationale for Image:Svarest.jpg==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Svarest.jpg]]'''. However, there is a concern that the rationale you have provided for using this image under &quot;fair use&quot; may be invalid. Please read the instructions at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] carefully, then go to the image description page and clarify why you think the image qualifies for fair use. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If it is determined that the image does not qualify under fair use, it will be deleted within a couple of days according to our [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images/media|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:No fair --&gt;[[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] ([[User talk:BetacommandBot|talk]]) 06:27, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
