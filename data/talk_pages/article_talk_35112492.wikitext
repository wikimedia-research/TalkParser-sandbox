'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Giriprasad73, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Giriprasad73|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[S Danapal]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:S Danapal]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:S Danapal]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:S Danapal|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]].  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 19:54, 17 March 2012 (UTC)
