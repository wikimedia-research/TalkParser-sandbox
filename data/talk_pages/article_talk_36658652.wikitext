[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Gareth Griffith-Jones|Gareth Griffith-Jones]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/74.59.201.13|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Kabylie]], because it didn't appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Gareth Griffith-Jones|my talk page]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;   [[User:Gareth Griffith-Jones|Gareth Griffith-Jones]] ([[User talk:Gareth Griffith-Jones|talk]]) 19:29, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

:The most importante political parti in the region of Kabylia, Algeria is the FFS and the RCD not the MAK. The MAK represent less than 1% of the population.
