==Miscarriage funny?==
It might be a good idea to remove the capitalized &quot;CONVENIENT MISCARRIAGE&quot; from the wiki article.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/130.253.155.135|130.253.155.135]] ([[User talk:130.253.155.135|talk]]) 00:32, 19 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==POV problem with genre listing==

This comic is claimed to be part of the &quot;humor&quot; genre.  Doesn't this break NPOV by implying that it is actually funny? [[User:Wanglordofwangs|Wanglordofwangs]] ([[User talk:Wanglordofwangs|talk]]) 05:44, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

:All humor is subjective. While it may be arguable whether or not you personally find the comic funny, there's no 'controversy' or debate as to whether or not the intention of the website is primarily humor. It's a genre listing, not a personal opinion, so no, it does not clash with NPOV.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 20:06, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

::I didn't realize author intentions determined what genre a work falls into.  If he had written a Star Wars rip-off but the intention was to write a hard-hitting detective comic, would we list &quot;mystery&quot; as the genre, rather than fantasy/science fiction? [[User:Cyclone231231|Cyclone231231]] ([[User talk:Cyclone231231|talk]]) 21:16, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

:::If it ended up being a mystery that takes place in a sci-fi setting, I imagine it would be listed under both genres. To use your example though, just because someone figures out the mystery by page two, and they didn't feel there was much of a mystery in the story, doesn't mean it wouldn't be listed under the mystery genre. They may not consider it a ''good'' mystery, but then that sort of distinction is where you start getting into POV issues.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 22:16, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

::::I don't think that's what they mean, Thrindel. This hypothetical comic wouldn't be a mystery at all, there'd be nothing to show it's a mystery, because it isn't, so why should it be listed as a mystery comic then? I could make a comic and say it's an homage to the Godfather movies, when it's actually about a dancing banana, so what would it be listed as?

:::::If there was nothing to show that it was a mystery, then no, I doubt that it would be classified as such. However that example doesn't really draw a parallel to this situation. Barring it's current story, there is an awful lot of material there that seems obviously intended as humor. It's pretty clear that he's not ''trying'' to draw a humor strip and coming up with an action title, or whatever. There are a ''lot'' of articles on Wikipedia with the 'humor' genre. I don't think &quot;is funny to everyone&quot; is a prerequisite for the listing.

::::: It's hardly an important detail of the article, but it seems odd to me to suggest its removal when so many other webcomics articles share the same genre tag. If I may ask, what do you feel makes this article the exception, and what would you suggest the listed genres be?--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 06:01, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:::To be completely honest, webcomics have no place at all in an encyclopedia.

[[User:GoatDoomOcculta|GoatDoomOcculta]] ([[User talk:GoatDoomOcculta|talk]]) 07:35, 18 June 2008 (UTC)
::::Not so, as this webcomic is notable because it has third party sources. &lt;span style=&quot;padding-top:3px;padding-left:2px;padding-right:2px;background-color:#f5faff;border:#cedff2 1px solid&quot;&gt;'''''[[User:Artichoker|Artichoker]]'''''&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Artichoker|[talk]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 12:26, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

:::::Just because something has a third party source, or even sources, does not mean that it belongs in an encyclopedia.  Referring back to the theoretical article about how I spent January 29th, 2001, what if I had held up a gas station that day, dressed in a chicken suit, and a half dozen local TV stations and/or newspapers had articles on my robbery - would that belong in an encyclopedia?  By your logic it would, but obviously, it does not, and neither does this nor probably ''any'' other webcomic article.  As for the alleged third-party sources for this article, out of 23 references, a whopping '''7''' of those are third-party.  2 are from insignificant local newspapers, another 2 are referring to the same exact thing - a couple of unimportant comics Buckley did for Civilization (&quot;''In 2007, Ctrl+Alt+Del partnered with 2K Games/Firaxis Games to produce a series of comics for Sid Meier's Civilization Daydreams [21][22][23]''&quot;).  Even the quote is inaccurate - CAD did not partner with these companies, Buckley did, and just because something is relevant to the author does not mean that it belongs in his comic's article.  Hell, it wasn't even a &quot;partnership&quot;, it was more like &quot;Hey, draw us some comics&quot;, and that was that.  There's nothing even close to a &quot;partnering&quot; there.  And, again, it's not even relevant to CAD, and yet 40% of the third-party sources for this article are for that line alone - '''and it's not even about the damn comic!'''
:::::Speaking of irrelevant lines that have nothing to do with the comic, but rather, the author (who - no, does not warrant his own Wikipedia entry), how about these two here? &quot;''There was an interview with Tim Buckley on CBSNews.com.[14]''&quot; and &quot;''In October of 2006, Tim Buckley gave a lecture at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute[15][16] in Troy, New York.''&quot;  I fail to see how an interview with Buckley on CBSNews.com is at all pertinent to an encyclopedia entry on CAD.  As for the second quote - further irrelevance about Buckley, rather than CAD.  Both of these lines should be removed due to their worthlessness and utter irrelevance to the intended subject of this Wikipedia entry.
:::::Upon removal of these completely irrelevant lines, you'll see that CAD is in fact about as notable as my theoretical January 29th, 2001 - and as unimportant to an encyclopedia.  The only third-party sources available for this relate to Buckley himself, rather than CAD, and one of them is as insignificant as a campus newspaper - is that even allowed to be called a notable third-party source?!
:::::Summary: This is not notable at all. The only &quot;third-party sources&quot; were added in a desperate attempt to make it seem so, and they are all relating to Buckley, rather than CAD.  These irrelevant lines need to be removed, and consequently, the references associated with them, and then, seeing as this subject is not even slightly notable, let's nominate it for deletion, shall we?

:::::::Nitpicking a bit, two of my best friends and my ex were arrested in September last year (Vanessa Waisbrot, Candace Basaker, James Riley) for robbing a Sunoco dressed as ninjas and then trying to flee to California days later.  This was on major news websites (moreso than CAD and Buckley have ever been) as well as countless local news stations in Pittsburgh and Kentucky (where they were apprehended).  Vanessa and James were even on [[America's Most Wanted]], and are still on the show's online database as '''CAPTURED'''.  However, if someone were to write a Wikipedia entry for them, individually or collectively, I guarantee it would be deleted about as fast as it was put up, despite them being far more notable than CAD and Buckley, by Wikipedia's definition of notability.

::::::::::I'm going to restate some points I made during a very similar discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel/Archive2#Proposed] that is now archived, since you're bringing op the exact same points.

::::::::::I want to preface this by saying that if you really feel this article will pass deletion (and really feel it needs to be deleted), then by all means, list it for such. It's not something I'll support personally, as I feel it's a little drastic, however if some neutral administrators look at the article and decide it should be deleted, I have no problem with that.

::::::::::While this article does contain quite a few sources from the website itself (although still not nearly as many as the VGCats article, which is nearly 90% so), the [[WP:SELFPUB]] states that self-published sources may be used in articles about themselves (which would be the case here, using the website as a source for the article about the website) so long as they meet a list of requirements.

::::::::::Most of the requirements are a non-issue with the sources in this article. They don't refer to third parties, there is no reasonable doubt as to the author, etc. The biggest question mark about them as I see it would be whether or they are relevant to the notability of the article. Now obviously some of these are strictly information-based sources, such as &quot;Ethan is of Irish Descent&quot;. That's proving information in the article more than it is trying to say that that particular tidbit of info is notable.

::::::::::Some of the other references, though, are (I believe) speaking to notability, or combined with other third party sources (such as the lecture mention on the school website, plus Buckley's newspost on the topic) to build a better overall picture of a particular note.

::::::::::My argument would be that, were the comic not notable or cared about in any sense at all, as you are suggesting, I can't see its author being asked to speak at a college, or being interviewed by CBSNews.com, or hired by a video game company to do promotional comic work for a game. It wouldn't be so much that those Civilization comics themselves are notable, but more that CtrlAltDel and its creator are notable enough that, when the game developer goes looking for webcomics to hire, of the possibly millions of webcomics that are online, CtrlAltDel is one of those they approached. And I don't think that would be the case, (the hiring, the lecture, the CBS interview, etc) were the comic not notable and known outside of its direct fanbase.

::::::::::&quot;Even the quote is inaccurate - CAD did not partner with these companies, Buckley did, and just because something is relevant to the author does not mean that it belongs in his comic's article.&quot; Buckley ''is'' CtrlAltDel. As far as I know, he's the only one that works on it, and it's the only thing he's notable for, which is why he doesn't have his own article. And if you look at the Civilization comics, they are clearly done in the same style and format, and posted on the CtrlAltDel website, and if you look at the third party reference, they clearly state that they've contracted/hired/whatever the artists of well-known webcomics. What Buckley did on January 29th, 2001 would not be of importance to a CtrlAltDel article just because he's the artist of the comic, but comic work, interviews, lectures that he is asked to do ''because'' the comic is well-known ''is'' relevant to the article, and the notability of the article.

::::::::::When this article was bloated and full of references from all over the place (the 1up.com article mention, interviews, etc) it was too big and fansite-ish. Now that it's been pruned back, it &quot;doesn't have enough sources&quot;. I fully agree that this article should be trim, and doesn't require all of the bloat it had months ago (the episode recaps, lengthy character bios, etc). But I think there's plenty there for the article to pass a notability test, especially compared to some other webcomic articles that remain untouched.

::::::::::If you really want to go try and get every webcomic article on Wikipedia deleted for the reasons you stated, then by all means, knock yourself out. But don't gut an article of decent sources just to achieve that goal. Take it to AfD as it is, and let the administrators decide if the sources are notable. I'll also point out that the editor who originally suggested the article for deletion, upon seeing the listing of new sources, has changed his mind.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 20:51, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

::::::::::I've also added another third party source to the article.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 21:16, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

:::::::::::Thrindel, Thrindel, Thrindel... I'm certainly not going to respond point-by-point to that massive wall of text, but I will touch on a few things and then carry on with the trimming and deletion process.  First, the issue here is '''not''' the VGCats article.  Once this passes for deletion, feel free to target the VGCats one to prove your [[WP:POINT]], I honestly don't care.

:::::::::::My issue is not with the large number of sources that are simply CAD or another Buckley-thing, but rather, the small number that ''aren't''.  If there were a substantial number of relevant, worthwhile, and notable third-party sources, then the first-party ones would be perfectly fine.  The fact of the matter is, though, that there just ''aren't''.

:::::::::::Buckley (who is clearly not you) was asked to speak at a single, insignificant college - that doesn't make his comic notable.  He probably asked to speak there, or a high-ranking faculty member there was a fan of CAD.  Same goes for the Civilization comics.  Did Buckley even get paid for those? - you said he was ''hired''.  And again, that's not the point - that makes the author notable, not the comic itself.  If you want to make a Buckley article then go for it, but I'm pretty sure you'd take considerable issue with the whole ROM incident inevitably being in there.

:::::::::::As for the author's deeds being irrelevant to his or her work(s) in an encyclopedia article on that work, take a look at The Wheel Of Time, or American Psycho, or the Mona Lisa - do you see irrelevant information about Robert Jordan, Brett Easton ellis, or da Vinci in those articles?  Of course not, because they're articles on those ''works'', and not the men behind them.

:::::::::::&quot;When this article was bloated and full of references from all over the place (the 1up.com article mention, interviews, etc) it was too big and fansite-ish. Now that it's been pruned back, it 'doesn't have enough sources'.&quot; -- If the article needs to have notable but irrelevant sources in order to be considered notable, then the subject of the article is clearly not notable, and thus should not exist.  This should pass for deletion with relative ease.

:::::::::::Anyway, are campus newspapers considered notable?  If so, then I'll go and nominate this right away, but if not, I'd appreciate a non-Thrindel Wikipedian's answer and then I'll go and take that out and ''then'' nominate it.  Thanks!

As long as he follows the proper procedure, GoatDoomOcculta can nominate this article for deletion. It does no good to sling veiled insults about the &quot;egg on [his] face&quot;. Also, Thrindel, you have made the above points numerous times over the course of this discussion page. They have been archived and duly noted. There is no need to reiterate your feelings every time someone tries to edit the article. If you feel it is necessary, just give a short summary or link to one of your prior defenses of CAD. Now, about the article: The references which relate only to Tim Buckley do not belong in this article. Their proponents state that they are needed to establish notability, as they show that Tim Buckley is notable.  However, Buckley's notability is of no consequence to that of this article. Winston Churchill was a poet, however, Wikipedia does not have pages for his individual poems because the notability of a person does not make their artistic creations notable. The fact that Buckley spoke at a college should not be used to establish notability for the CAD webcomic.

The only notability Buckley has is directly related to CAD, and that he was invited to speak at a college ''about'' the comic strip and ''because of'' the comic strip is what pertains to the notability of the comic strip. There are no references attempting to establish Buckley's notability as a separate entity. All mentions and references to Tim Buckley in the article are directly related to his role as the creator of the comic strip that the article pertains to. Your example with Winston Churchill is backwards and inapplicable to this situation. Buckley's notability doesn't make CAD notable. If anything, quite the opposite.

A reason for the possible lack of &quot;sources&quot; (at least on the CAD forums) of criticism may be down to the fact that Tim Buckley bans anyone on his forums, and deletes all traces of negativity, whenever someone dares post a hint of it. It's also notible that the www.cad-forums.com are still down following numerous incidents that accumulated in this manner, only some relating to things about Tim personally.

It could be argued that while Yahtzee is an established critic, he's established as an expert on video game critique, not comics. However let's say for the sake of arguments that he's established as a critic, and though it's video games, CAD falls under it because it's a gaming related strip. Ok good. Next up is the actual criticism video itself, which is fairly vague in any of its criticism on specific subjects. CAD was clearly referenced, but there were a lot of very generic statements in there. It's not like he sat down and made a video directed at CAD. To use an analogy, it's sort of like a food critic saying &quot;Steak is awful when it is cooked well-done&quot;, and then adding the critic's statements to a restaurant just because it serves steak. But aaaaanyway...
:::Barring those two things, we still run into [[WP:UNDUE]]. I'm happy to leave the heading there for a while, to see if people come with some more proper sources, but if not, all we're left with is one person's opinion. It may be an opinion shared by many, but if it was a notable opinion shared by many, you probably wouldn't have any trouble coming up with sources. And so, as far as looking at the opinion from a [[WP:V]] standpoint goes, we have one person's opinion, which is then a minority viewpoint, which doesn't belong in the article.

:::These are the reasons why the article hasn't had a criticism section. Not because there are no criticisms of the comic, undeniably there are. It's because the comic isn't notable enough to generate praise or criticisms in the circles of media that would produce nice solid sources. Right now pretty much all we have is a bunch of people saying &quot;I like the comic!&quot; and another bunch saying &quot;I hate the comic&quot;, and from a encyclopedic standpoint the response is a big &quot;who cares?&quot;.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 04:10, 6 July 2008 (UTC)
**The problem is, there is enough anecdotal evidence to support the notion that Buckley or his minions watch this page, and remove any whiff of bad press. There is also anecdotal evidence that Buckley or those associated with him have come onto Wikipedia to vandalize pages of other artists who Buckley has disagreements with, like PvP. The bad blood between Buckley and Kurtz &amp; Straub is well known. I may have personal reasons to dislike Buckley (I've never met him myself, but guildmates were involved in the Rapscallions incident), but that does not mean I cannot be objective when it comes to this article. it's important to have this section, and to have it conform to established Wikipedia guidelines. Swinging too far in ''either'' direction is bad. Too much hate, and it's vandalism. Removing the section on spurious grounds is also vandalism, as it raises suspicions that the article is bring sanitized again.

Artichoker: FullyRamblomatic is Yahtzee's personal blog. Whereas Zero Punctuation could be argued a third party source, as it seems he's employed by The Escapist for it, his blog is just a personal website. If you really want to reference his blog, shall we take into account this quote from his latest entry, in which he clearly states his video on webcomics was directed at no comic in particular?

''&quot;Just to prove that I am never one to discount pettiness and passive-aggressiveness from my many, many flaws, I devoted this week's video to ragging on irritating popular trends in gaming-themed webcomics. The problems are so endemic that I felt no need to name any actual names, so as I say at the end, if you happen to think I might be referring to any specific comic, that says more about your own feelings about it than mine.&quot;''

The VGCats parody may be criticism, it may not be. Scott [http://www.vgcats.com/index.php#april-1-08 said it was just friendly ribbing]. Still, I don't think one parody comic counts as evidence of a &quot;common criticism&quot;. The most we could say in the article is &quot;VGCats did an April Fools parody of CAD&quot;. You can't assign meaning or explanations to it beyond face value.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 22:53, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Without that, perhaps we could surmise that he was intending to criticize CAD on these counts. But for all we know, we just just playing off of the complaints that ''readers'' have about CAD. You can't assume Ramsoomair's intentions. As I said earlier, the most that should be there is &quot;VGCats did an april fools parody of CAD&quot;, in a very factual, straightforward language.

I find it amusing that in a series of 7 small edits you removed every single edit that I made to the article.

: I have re-added the Yahtzee website/blog reference, and reworded it, removing the quotes.  An artist having a stagnant art style is a very, very common criticism, and I see no reason as to why people openly referencing it should not be mentioned here.  Ditto with the B^U April Fools joke, even if it was &quot;playful ribbing&quot;, it references an extremely common criticism of the comic -- namely, that the artist uses the Keanu Reeves style facial expression denoted  by &quot;B^U&quot; very, very often -- to the point that it has become a meme or slang term related to the comic.

::: No, I think we're fine right now Big T, as long as you don't nickle-and-dime the entire criticism section away again.  As for the blog, referencing that his video was an updated (and slightly toned down) version of his criticism of Buckley on his blog is noteworthy information, and should go into the article.  Journals and self-published works are a valid source IF the person working on them also has other published content -- in this case, Yahtzee's blog is a valid source because it offers another look at his popular video series' content.  In addition, the criticisms that Yahtzee brings up in the blog post but does not focus on in the video -- namely, that Buckley's art style does not evolve (while his art blog shows he is very, very capable of drawing more complex works) and that Buckley does not have a grasp on webcomic punchline timing -- are very common criticisms, but again, due to the culture around Webcomics, most of these critiques are posted on blogs and forums, which are not valid.  [[User:KiTA|KiTA]] ([[User talk:KiTA|talk]]) 02:24, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:::: From [[WP:SPS]]: &quot;Self-published material may, in some circumstances, be acceptable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the '''relevant field''' has previously been published by reliable '''third-party publications.'''&quot; Yahtzee is not an established critic in the field of art or webcomics.
:::: It also mentions that Self published sources can at no time be used as third party sources about living people.
:::: Additionally, I refer you to the quote I posted early taken from Yahtzee's latest blog, in which he specifically states he was targeting no webcomic specifically with the video. So if you want to include his blog as a reference, that sort of negates the &quot;this video is a criticism of CAD&quot; aspect. And without that video (being the third party source) his blog once again becomes just a blog.

::::: I think saying that the webcomics video -- especially given his essay on his website about the subject -- is somehow NOT criticism of CAD is intentionally stretching your point well past the breaking point.

[[User:KiTA|KiTA]] ([[User talk:KiTA|talk]]) 02:42, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
::::: I'm not saying that he doesn't include CAD in his opinion of gaming webcomics on a whole, but that's an awful lot of assumption going on, for him to say &quot;I dislike gaming webcomics, I'm not targeting anyone specifically&quot; and then for you to say &quot;that's just his way of making another attack&quot;. My point is, CAD reference or not, it still makes it look like a pretty general attack on gaming comics. To re-use my earlier analogy, it's like taking an article on a restaurant, and saying that some food critic's general opinion on steak is relevant just because the restaurant happens to serve steak.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 02:51, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::: No, no it is most certainly NOT.  Yahtzee specifically mentions a miscarriage in the video.  He specifically mentions walls of dialogue covering up the artwork.

[[User:KiTA|KiTA]] ([[User talk:KiTA|talk]]) 03:05, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
::::::: The miscarriage thing, yes, clearly a specific reference. The text thing could probably be applied to any number of comics, along with most of the criticisms in the video. While it may seem apparent to you that the criticisms ''apply'' to CAD, it is important to also recognize that the video is not necessarily directed ''at'' CAD. It is unfair to say that &quot;this video is based on Yahtzee's previous CAD rant&quot; because you don't know that for sure. You also can't use language like &quot;this is a 'common' criticism&quot; when you only have one single source.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 03:25, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

Reverted the criticism section's sanitation by Thrindel.  Again.  The VG Cats Reference is NOT original research.  Would anyone like to help me find a reference to the &quot;wall of text&quot; criticism that will pass the policy-wonking of the [[WP:SPA|SPA]] accounts trying to keep any criticism of the comic/artist off the page?  As we cannot use forum quotes nor blog quotes, despite forums and blogs being so central to the topic, how about references in other comics?  I seem to remember PVP having a comic about Ladybugs after CAD was accused of stealing the &quot;scorpions in a box&quot; gag, for example.  [[User:KiTA|KiTA]] ([[User talk:KiTA|talk]]) 11:30, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
: I have expanded and reworded slightly the Fully Ramblomatic part of the criticism page.  Thrindel has a point, however tortured and strained, that we cannot link the essay talking about Video Game Webcomics (wherein Yahtzee specifically mentions CAD by the parody name &quot;Bontrol+Bolt+Belete&quot;) to a previous essay by Yahtzee on the same topic.  However, that does not make for a good excuse to remove the entire reference -- the essay on his website is still criticism of CAD and belongs in the article, particularly as it covers the 3 major criticisms I hear referenced to CAD -- that is, the overuse of dialogue (aka the &quot;Wall of Text&quot;), the failure of comedic pacing (Punch line in the first frame, 3 frames explaining the joke), and the unchanging art style (B^U).  These criticisms are very common on websites we cannot use as sources due to them being blogs or forum posts, making Yahtzee's essay all the more valuable as a source.

:Heh, how can you ''not'' call it [[WP:NOR]]? We have an april fools comic which is clearly a parody of CAD. That's not OR, and nobody ever said it was. What ''is'' OR, however, is taking that comic as the sole source of the criticism and adding &quot;The title, Bee Up Arrow You, is in reference to a popular meme describing a popular facial structure that CAD characters have, which is titled B^U.&quot; Because that description explaining the 'meme&quot; is found ''nowhere'' in the comic strip or in any newsposts by the artist. So since it's not being pulled from an actual verifiable source, it is &quot;speculation&quot; or an &quot;'''unpublished analysis''' or synthesis '''of published material that serves to advance a position&quot;''', as defined by [[WP:NOR]]. It very well be what the 'meme' means, but &quot;it's common knowledge&quot; is not good enough source to prove it. If the source you're providing (in this case the comic) doesn't explain the content on its own, you can't add your own interpretation or description to make it notable to the article.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 22:13, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
:: Given that we had to revert a few thousand &quot;B^U&quot;s on this very talk page today, I think saying that defining &quot;Bee Up Arrow You&quot; is &quot;original research&quot; is a HUGE stretch.  It is a very, very common criticism of CAD and Buckley -- heck, people on forums have even taken to calling him &quot;B^Uckley&quot;.
:: Not that we can actually mention that in the article, as the policies forbid it.  But seriously, just because you've found a nice combination of Wikipedia policies that somehow invalidate 99.999% of all criticism of CAD and ''should not apply to this particular situation'' does not mean that the criticism does not exist.  I mean seriously, what do I have to do, request the author of PVP or Zero Punctuation or VGCats or heck, even SomethingAwful or something put up an essay, rant or video someplace outside of their forums explaining what &quot;B^U&quot; means, and that yes, Buckley is really wordy, can't tell a joke, etc etc?
:: On a lighter note, I finally found [http://badwebcomics.blogspot.com/2007/06/ctrlaltdel.html this BadWebComics essay on CAD].  Does it warrant a reference in the article?  It contains much of the same criticism as the Yahtzee essay -- minus the dead baby storyline -- but is much more crude and &quot;in your face&quot;.

:::It's a blog, SPS, written by nobody with any published third party credentials or expertise, so no.
:::I've never said that criticism doesn't exist. But you need to keep in mind that this an encyclopedia, a source for ''fact.'' The policies I've &quot;found&quot; are in place to prevent people from saying whatever they want in these articles, including expressing personal opinion. It is not our job to create information, only to find sources from people with established fact-finding credentials to construct an article of fact. I'm not asking you to source something that is ''clearly'' common knowledge, like &quot;humans breath oxygen&quot;, which would be overboard with the policy. If this is something you can't source properly because it is only found on personal blogs and internet forums, then that's probably a clear cut sign that it doesn't belong in the article until you ''can'' properly source it.
:::Criticism is not fact, it is opinion. Opinions can only be presented in the article in the context that it is fact that someone of note has this opinion. For example, you can't say &quot;Cucumbers are disgusting&quot; in an article and then source to some food critic saying that. The article needs to read &quot;Critic X thinks cucumbers are disgusting&quot; with the source following. You don't have a source from the artist of VGCats where he expresses his opinion. You can't know what the purpose of that comic was, directed criticism or friendly ribbing. And it doesn't tell us what &quot;beeyou&quot; is. That's why what is in the article right now is original research. Because it's information ''you're'' telling us, not information VGCats is telling us.
:::Opinions of people that have not been published by third party sources do not count here.

Sorry to shift gears a bit, but the language regarding the Ctrl Alt Del reference in the Mass Effect review should be revisited.  Previously it said &quot;...comparing the game's abundance of dialogue to that of the webcomic.&quot;  This was changed to &quot;...that of webcomics&quot;.  I understand the reason for the change, but I think the edit is a leap to the other extreme.  The dialogue spoken at that point refers to &quot;a lot of webcomic authors&quot;.  Changing the language to &quot;...that of '''certain''' webcomics&quot; is a fair compromise (as well as a more accurate characterization).

:Would &quot;some webcomics&quot; or &quot;a lot of webcomics&quot; be as acceptable? I agree that &quot;that of webcomics&quot; is too broad a statement (my edit originally, I believe, to pluralize to reflect his spoken dialogue), but &quot;certain webcomics&quot; still feels too narrow, like Yahtzee had compiled a list of them, rather than making generalizations.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 22:16, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

The &quot;Cyanide and Happiness&quot; CAD parody should be included in this section. (http://www.explosm.net/comics/1310/) This was originally proposed, but Thrindel responded calling it &quot;a panel-by-panel recreation of a CAD comic&quot; and no one really called her/him on it.  Stating the obvious, the first 4 of 6 panels are a recreation of a CAD comic, and finally some text from Buckley's accompanying news post is used as a character's actual dialogue.  Determining exactly what the author is trying to say is a bit subjective, but the juxtaposition of comic and news post to make clear the subject matter's absurdity in the context of the webcomic is obvious. [[User:Pxlt|Pxlt]] ([[User talk:Pxlt|talk]]) 15:53, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

:It's not a notable source of criticism. It's just a parody. It's also from a self-published source that is not also an established expert on comic/art criticism that has been published by a third party. The comic doesn't make any clear criticisms of CAD, so short of making an WP:OR interpretation of intent, the only fact is &quot;Comic X made a parody of Comic Y&quot;, and how would you deem that at notable to this article? That some other comic didn't like one of the storylines? Big deal. It wouldn't stand on its own, so it doesn't stand just because there's a criticism section in the article now.
:This criticism section is being cobbled together around one single proper source (the yahtzee video), which no matter how much people expand the paragraph with language about his opinion, it is still a single person's opinion, and a minority viewpoint from a [[WP:UNDUE]] standpoint. The VGCats comic is also an interpretive SPS that remains in the article in the hopes that someone can come up with a proper secondary source for the beeyou title, but barring that interpretive language it's still &quot;Comic X made a parody of Comic Y&quot; from a non-expert with no published opinions on the topic.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 19:18, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

::::You're kind of misinterpreting what you quoted-- the important part is how widely a viewpoint is held ''among reliable or expert sources''.

If so, then Wikipedia should certainly reflect this reality, unless you can find reliable sources that offer an opposing viewpoint and/or evidence that Yahtzee's opinion is a minority one.

Also, there are quite a few examples of apparant criticism, from friendly ribbing (see the previously posted VGcats and Cyanide and Happiness comics) and pure criticism (You can find examples on the PvP forum), which, although not on pages we can source, is pretty good proof that there is criticism of CAD in the circles of webcomic artists.

::::::: Lack of other sources is not &quot;proof&quot; that this guy's opinion is significant, Milskidasith. Yahtzee himself is not even an &quot;expert&quot; critic of this medium. That he had a webcomic at one point means nothing, everyone and their grandmother on the internet has had a webcomic these days. Yahtzee made a name for himself as a critic of video games, that is what got him published by a third party. That he's a video game critic and CAD writes about video games is a weak link to tie the two together. That he did an episode on webcomics isn't much better. That's like a movie critic writing one column about a restaurant he disliked. It doesn't make him an expert food critic. In all likelihood, we'll never see another Zero Punctuation on webcomics.
::::::: I have no problem with criticism being noted as long as it's significant, properly sources and goes towards improving the overall article. [[WP:UNDUE]] isn't just about undue weight to the individual sources, it's also about undue weight in their relation to the entire article.

That is undue weight right there. Ignoring whether or not the man's opinion should be in the article at all, it is certainly not an important enough opinion to warrant that much exploration in the article.

::::::::You kind of forgot, in terms of Yahtzee's significance, that '''he wrote his own webcomic.''' Anyway, maybe it is a little bloated, but then again, maybe it's not. I mean, the rest of the article pretty much only comes from one individual source (namely, the actual site of Ctrl-alt-del) so it isn't like the criticism section being large is that undue.

: It's a self-published website, and not one that is self-published by any (as far as I can tell) kind of recognized webcomic expert.

It's been four weeks and no (notable) corroborating sources have been found for the 'internet meme' in the VGCats comic.

:I am interested in knowing how it is that you justify removing statements that someone is a critic of the comic.  It certainly seems sourced and that does not really fit well with the claim that you are doing it to fit the overall importance to the article.  This is especially true in light of the fact that there is significant evidence to suggest you are quite involved in the material this article covers and raises ethical concerns regarding non-fact oriented edits made by you.  Everyone may edit Wikipedia and a person should not be discouraged from correcting errors in an article just because it is about them or something close to them but that person should certainly be more careful in where they make their edits and stylistic ones like these are certainly troubling to many.

:: Ignoring your completely innapropriate and unfounded COI accusations, I feel like I've explained my reasoning at least six times on this page, but I will do so once again.
:: 1) The 'internet meme', it was unsourced. I added a citation tag to the line and waited four weeks. No proper sources were produced. So that was removed. It can always be put back in if a good source for its use can be found.
:: 2) So after that we're left with a big paragraph of Yahtzhee's opinion. This paragraph explaining his opinion is larger than any other section of the artice. Neither CtrlAltDel nor Yahtzee are so very important that this article needs a giant section devoted to what one guy thinks of it. Whether a ''video game critic's'' opinion of a ''webcomic'' is important at all, I'm not entirely convinced yet, however it does at least have some proper sources, so it can stay while other notable sources are sought.
:: However, a lot of us have spent time trimming the article down from what it used to be (bloated), to bring it more in line with the subject's importance. CAD is not the most important or notable webcomic out there, and it is not the least important. It warrants an article, but not as large an article as it might be with all of the stuff we ''could'' put in there. So when there's a section that isn't even directly about the comic, it's about what some guy ''thinks'' of the comic, and its larger than any other section in the article, something is out of wack.

Therefore, I agree that the meme should be removed but more on technicality than lack of validity.  Regarding the other edits, I find most of them questionable...especially in regard to my own personal knowledge regarding your COI.

Mike Fahey of Kotaku has said he can no longer stomach the comic since the miscarriage arc: http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2008/07/zero_punctuation_takes_on_ctrlaltdel-2.html -- not sure if that merits addition.

And as it would have been notable if Kotaku had posted an article about CAD I think it's quite fair to say it's notable if they post one where they say they don't like it.

On the subject of Thrindel saying, in essence, that an article on CAD is allowed to take positive sources from CAD is, in the context of an encyclopaedia, a laughable concept. Allow me to put it as thus. I create an article on myself, in this article, I make repeated references to my own website to back up points I make. This in itself is laughable. perhaps I am regarded in a niche field, say, music blogging and reviewing music on said blog. Now, if my were absolutely atrocious, but still read by a large volume of people, I would have a large section of the music blogging community critising me on their own blogs. these might be perfectly valid critisisms, however, as they come from a self published source, wiki rules say they can't be used, even though I myself have used my own website as a source. (to put it as Thrindel would;&quot;since this is an article about [my website], sources from [my website] are perfectly acceptable&quot;).

Critisism by others who are in the field should be perfectly acceptable, as it constitutes the closest we can get to a work being reviewed by its peers. (Ben Crowshaw included, even though ZP is what he is now known for) either:
*In posts by them on their forums/news sections (note: other forum members do not count)
*Either directly, or through allusion in an established webcomic
*Personal blog posts by webcomic authors critising a particular person in the field's work.

At the very least, if sources cannot be taken from a self-published website, the webcomics main pages included, to provide critical views held by the peer's of the subject of the article, then they should note be allowed to flesh out the article beyond the basics (for webcomics this would be the characters, and any arcs, but anything beyond that, e.g., Penny Arcade's &quot;Child's Play&quot;, would have to have information acquired from a different source.)

: From [[WP:SPS]], self-published sources are allowed, in articles about themselves, as long as they meet certain requirements. However the article still needs to establish notability via third-party sources, which this article does. So yes, if you are a music blogger with established notability that can be sourced to third parties, and an article was created about your music blog, certain sources ''from'' your music blog could be used. For instance, if we have an article about a notable website that states it updates two days a week, we don't need to find a third-party source that verifies this. Using a source directly from the website (since the article is about the website) is perfectly fine.
: The article cannot be based primarily on SPS sources, and SPS sources cannot be used if they make claims about third parties.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 21:38, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

:::I'm not actually, what I'm proposing would have a much wider impact, and in the views of some, could be seen as slightly radical. what I'm saying is in niche fields, where criticisms would be difficult to find in pages which are not SPS, these sources should be allowed to be used, providing the publisher of the source is notable in his field. For instance, If Randall Munroe of xkcd writes on his &quot;blag&quot; about the faults of CAD, this should be seen as a usable source, as the criticism comes from someone established in the same, or in a similar field and, as I mentioned above, constitutes something similar to the work being reviewed by the peers of the articles subject matter. forum posts by those in a notable position in the field should also be considered, however, those by other members of their forum should not, unless they are also established Webcomic artists and have been proven as being so. this way, we can make sure that an article would be able to portray criticisms from others in the field. This way, we can make sure that articles on many niche fields are much more balanced.

The purpose of the 'Criticism' section of a page is not to sugar-coat the negative opinions of the content in question.

:::::::::Y'know Thrindel, I have to say, I really don't like the way you undo my entire edit when only certain parts of it are incorrect. It's really quite retrogressive. 
::::::::&quot;Your addition and rewording of the VGCats paragraph adds excessive OR to a portion that already requires a citation for what little speculation was there.&quot;
:::::::::Uh, no, it really doesn't. It's an explanation of the B^U face, explaining that it's also a popular meme, citing the VGCats comic as an example of the meme and source for the explanation. 
::::::::&quot;Your second paragraph is completely OR.&quot;
:::::::::Absolutely not. It was an explanation of the significance of the miscarriage storyline, leading into the part about Yahtzee, which was a legitimate source of the view in the second paragraph. It's quite clear that the two are connected, if you actually bothered to read them.

:::::::::I did very little to that paragraph in terms of &quot;embellish&quot;ing the language. All that I did was reword it so that it made sense in relation to the second paragraph, since the two are connected.

:::::::::: Jerrokun, please take a moment to read [[WP:NOR]]. Let me break it down for you.
:::::::::: &quot;The use of a similar facial expression in the majority of comics, illustrated by the emoticon &quot;B^U&quot;, is a common complaint. The &quot;B^U&quot; emoticon is used to exaggerate the bored and sarcastic expression on most character's faces in the comic.&quot; You don't have any sources from notable critics making either of these points, that A)that is what the meme means that B) its in the &quot;majority of comics&quot; and especially C) that the expressions are considered &quot;bored and sarcastic&quot;. This is an elaboration on a description of an internet meme which already had no direct source, and has a &quot;citation needed&quot; tag on it. You're adding more OR language to the paragraph and removing the request for sources.
::::::::::&quot;A recent storyline involving a miscarriage has also been criticized. The abrupt change from humor to drama is seen as a way to generate controversy and gain more viewers.&quot; This is new information/speculation. You have no sources that say this.
:::::::::: &quot;Because of how sensitive the topic was to Tim, the miscarriage based on his own experience[[http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/news.php?i=1636]], many critics of the comic made edits to the original comic, ridiculing the event.&quot; This is new information/speculation. You have no sources that say this.
:::::::::: &quot;[[Ben Croshaw|Yahtzee]], who has criticized Ctrl+Alt+Delete on several occassions in his videos,&quot; We sourced and mentioned the two that we found with CAD mentions. If you have others to constitute &quot;several&quot;, please source them.
:::::::::: So since the second paragraph is all OR, and the edit to the third paragraph is unsourced, the rewording of the whole section is unecessary.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 14:05, 11 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::The first paragraph uses the VGCats comic as a source and example of the meme. For the second paragraph, you are right about the second part, but not the first. The first is absolutely not speculation. It leads into the part about Yahtzee, which also happens to contain the sources for the &quot;second paragraph&quot;, which is actually part of the third now. As for the third paragraph, you're just nitpicking so you can say you have something wrong with all 3 sections. Seriously, if using &quot;several&quot; is an issue for you, just change it to &quot;a couple&quot; or &quot;two&quot;. [[User:Jerrokun|Jerrokun]] ([[User talk:Jerrokun|talk]]) 02:17, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Yes, I know that you think you're using the sources that are already there, but the information you're adding to the article ''does not exist'' in the sources we already have. You're taking a sourced picture of an apple and adding &quot;also, apples cause cancer&quot;.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 02:35, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::::Please give me an example of what doesn't exist within the sources, so that I can remove it, or remove it yourself. [[User:Jerrokun|Jerrokun]] ([[User talk:Jerrokun|talk]]) 03:10, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::::: I'm pretty sure I already did that.
:::::::::::::: &quot;The use of a similar facial expression in the majority of comics, illustrated by the emoticon &quot;B^U&quot;, is a common complaint.&quot; You have ''one'' source, a comic strip that you don't even know is intended as a complaint, so it is not a &quot;common complaint&quot;. Saying so is your original research.
:::::::::::::: &quot;The &quot;B^U&quot; emoticon is used to exaggerate the bored and sarcastic expression on most character's faces in the comic. &quot;B^U&quot; is also a popular internet [[meme]].&quot; Again, the comic strip says '''none''' of this. The comic sports the title &quot;Bee Up Arrow You&quot;, and that's the only fact about it. Adding an explanation to what this title is supposed to mean without sources to back it up is Original Research. What ''was'' in the article explaining the &quot;meme&quot; was also tagged with a cite request, which you keep removing. It has a cite request because it needs a source to stay in the article at all, it does not need even more OR heaped on top of it in the meantime.
:::::::::::::: &quot;A recent storyline involving a miscarriage has also been criticized.&quot; This is already covered with &quot;references recent storyline events&quot;, because all it is is a passing reference. Had he stopped to make actual critique of the storyline, that would be different.
:::::::::::::: &quot;The abrupt change from humor to drama is seen as a way to generate controversy and gain more viewers.&quot; This is said ''nowhere'' in any of Yahtzee's material, this is entirely your opinion and original research.
:::::::::::::: &quot;who has criticized Ctrl+Alt+Delete on several occassions in his videos, included a parody of CAD called &quot;Bontrol+Bolt+Belete&quot; and references recent storyline events, including the miscarriage&quot; He has not criticized the comic on several occasions in his videos. He has, at most, referenced it twice, and both instances are cited and mentioned. And in addition, in the video where he mentions &quot;recent storyline events&quot;, the ''only'' storyline event mentioned is the miscarriage, so adding &quot;including the miscarriage&quot; at the end is unecessary filler.
:::::::::::::: Finally, a quote directly from [[WP:OR]], &quot;Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: to demonstrate that you are not presenting original research, you must cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and that directly support the information as it is presented.&quot;
:::::::::::::: The information you are trying to add is not in any of the sources already cited, and you are not providing any new sources for it.
:::::::::::::: So I hope that ''this time'' you understand what is wrong with these edits, and I hope that we won't see them re-added without some proper citations from notable sources along with them. If you have questions about what constitute proper [[WP:V]] sources, feel free to bring them to the talk page for discussion.--[[User:Thrindel|Thrindel]] ([[User talk:Thrindel|talk]]) 03:51, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

This is [http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/02/pax-2008-the-penny-arcade-interview/ possibly a bit too over-the-top to actually use], but there are now some public comments on Ctrl+Alt+Del by the Penny Arcade guys.

:You would know why it's not relevant if you had bothered to read the lengthy discussion that has already been had on the topic.

The VGCats april fools comic is not a source for the internet meme because it does nothing to explain the meme, short of interpretive [[WP:OR]] that doesn't belong here.

:::::::::: Actually Thrindel, most of the comments are more than fair.  For example, there was the person who suggested that the &lt;i&gt;Bee Arrow Up You&lt;/i&gt; parody should be mentioned. Yet you just said &quot;oh that isn't criticism, you're just interpreting it that way.&quot;, and deleted his addition. Or there was the people who suggested that there should be mention of Gabe and Tycho's comments on Buckley. Certainly the comments of the creators of one of the most popular comics deserves some mention. Again, every time someone tried to include that, you reverted it. The way you seem to constantly delete negative additions, despite being warned before about edit wars, makes it look like you just don't want people to hear what others think of CAD. Many pages have a reception section that describes what the popular opinion of the work is, and they don't have any problems with people saying that the section contains OR or has too much POV. I think that people's criticisms about the comic should be heard, whether they are positive or negative.

If Buckley can't accept criticism, that's his problem. But the actual article ''should'' contain the publics views on it, just like everything else.

== Parodies section/memes, perhaps? ==

The webcomic is fairly open to parodies, and since that thrindel guy seems to care so much about the criticism section, perhaps we could add a parodies section? Several more notable comics have had parodies of it in their story lines (Cyanide and Happiness and VG cats to name but a few) and by some small margin is this not a sign of the actual comics notablility? Particularly the Miscarriage strip has been parodied, and a few internet memes have arisen from them. Memes are hard to find sources for, but do they really need sources? It's just something that's posted on forums and places like 4chan for humour purproses. Notable, but not referable.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:A Chain Of Flowers|A Chain Of Flowers]] ([[User talk:A Chain Of Flowers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/A Chain Of Flowers|contribs]]) 11:52, 3 September 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::::: That's not really a sign of notability. What comic is &quot;more notable&quot; than another is generally a debatable concept. There are far, far more notable subjects, things like Star Wars that beyond a doubt have spawned tons of parodies in popular culture, and these articles do not feature a &quot;parodies&quot; section. It reads like trivia or fancruft. In addition to that, they are self-published sources. Self published sources are fine in articles about themselves, as long as certain criteria is met, but they are not okay for third party articles. These are the reasons it does not belong in the article.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:59, 3 September 2008 (UTC)
:::::: I agree with a Chain of Flowers, the fact that other authors care enough to parody it shows that the comic is notable. As the saying goes, &quot;Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery&quot;. It seems to me that you just don't like that it's notable for being parodied by other authors. Buckley himself must have known that his comic would initially be made fun of, that's why he hung a lampshade on the fact that his comic shamelessly rips off the concept of other comics in the genre in his first strip.

::::::::::::: And I understand that. But this is like if we were to add any comic from VGCats or CAD that parodied a game, to said game's article. If VGCats makes a comic parody on Super Mario, we don't go adding a mention to some &quot;Parodies&quot; section under the Super Mario article. Heck, even if the New York Times did a parody of Mario, I doubt it would make it into the article. Why? Because parodies aren't generally important or notable, unless you can provide some sort of background in addition that makes the parody notable.
::::::::::::: For instance: Penny Arcade did a parody of strawberry shortcake, I believe. That's listed in the strawberry shortcake article because there was a resulting legal issue involved. If that legal issue hadn't happened, the mention wouldn't be there.

== Character List ==

I don't perticularly think the character list needs to be that long or that detailed. Some of the characters have longer descriptions than entire sections in the article and it just reads like an individual biography of each and every character that has ever appeared in the comic. I think the article should include just the main characters and any major recurring supporting cast. I do not think that it needs to include a list of minor no longer appearing cast. I agree with most of the comments on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Ctrl+Alt+Del characters]] that the list is mostly fancruft and needs severe trimming to just major/recurring. I don't see how we can effectively more than doubled the size of the article by adding a list of every character who ever appeared on the comic. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:3px solid #CD0000;padding:3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Knowledgeum|&lt;b&gt;Knowledgeum&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Knowledgeum|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFFFF;background:#CD0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 08:49, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

::: In light of adding the comment from Holkins to the article, which is not criticism but rather his dislike of the storyline in question, I suggested changing the heading to 'Reception' as an umbrella heading to cover both the criticism from Croshaw and the reaction quote, and the editor, 3-Sphere, agreed. I felt that Holkins' comment is not substantial enough to warrant it's own section, and it also works well following the comments from Croshaw on the same subject, which is why the two were combined and placed under a heading title that encompasses both.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:55, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

== Gears of War 2 Presentation ==

Adding that the presentation is parodying &quot;excessive&quot; dialog is not the case. If you watch the actual presentation they state no such thing at all. The entire presentation can be viewed here[http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/news.php?i=1721#1722]. I have already gone to the trouble of writing out the relevant section as there is nothing to state that they are parodying it for excessive dialog. Here is the transcript with relevant time stamps.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;15:40&gt;So heres an example of, I don't know if everybody can read the text so I'll abbreviate it. The great guys at Ctrl Alt Del made this comic where Cliff is saying how will we make Gears 2 bigger, and some unnamed executive at Epic, I cant imagine who it'd be, is going &quot; what are we gonna do, we already have a chainsaw man!&quot; And over here you can see quite unrealistically cliff slapping with the front of his hand, because he backhands me when he's upset. And says &quot;I've got ideas. And then trainsaw was our plan. So clearly we will have a trainsaw in our game, look for it. So they know, the comic artists know the guys with the humor know that you can't always compete with yourself.&lt;16:22&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don't see anywhere in that entire section about the text other than it is hard to read on the projector slides, as such I have removed it from the reception section as a parody of &quot;excessive dialog&quot;. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:3px solid #CD0000;padding:3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Knowledgeum|&lt;b&gt;Knowledgeum&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Knowledgeum|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFFFF;background:#CD0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:53, 20 September 2008 (UTC)

==RfC: CAD Sillies as a seperate paragraph==



Do the CAD Sillies belong in a seperate paragraph or the article header?

:They really don't. A brief mention, perhaps. A full paragraph full of mostly useless information? I think not--[[User:A Chain Of Flowers|A Chain Of Flowers]] ([[User talk:A Chain Of Flowers|talk]]) 17:41, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

:The section ''was'' a brief mention. It was concise and to the point, and covers a topic which is a spin-off/addition to the main subject of the article. Other spin-offs have their small sections as well, on this and other similar articles (VGCats, Penny Arcade). Additionally, the sections are a good way to categorize and seperate the different bits of information, rather that just shoving it all into one giant paragraph at the beginning of the article.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:06, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

:Then let's do what the VGCats article does, and have a section for related comics in general, rather than a whole section for one thing. [[Special:Contributions/142.33.122.31|142.33.122.31]] ([[User talk:142.33.122.31|talk]]) 20:17, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

:: That would make more sense, to be honest. I agree with this. And the &quot;useless information&quot; I'm talking about is the overall lack of common sense in this article, as if everything needs to be explained concisely. A brief mention of all the spin offs and other such things (CAD premium, the dreadful &quot;Other works&quot; section&quot;, etc) into one &quot;to the point&quot;, as thrindel put it, paragraph/section would be more sufficient. There's just not enough information for all these things to merit their own section.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:A Chain Of Flowers|A Chain Of Flowers]] ([[User talk:A Chain Of Flowers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/A Chain Of Flowers|contribs]]) 21:49, 25 September 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::: And that will be fine... once CAD starts doing more than the one spinoff webcomic. VGCats does like four or something, so it makes sense for them to be grouped into one section. As far as I'm aware, the sillies are the only spinoff. These are facets of the content that that article is about. You are treating them like we're attempting to give them their own articles. Entire articles, and sections within an article, are not viewed with the same weight. Why should we lump everything into a single &quot;other&quot; section with scatterbrained information about a bunch of different things that someone has to sort through, when it's not taking any additional space or resources to give the major facets a section heading.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

:::: Agreed, there seems to be this movement going onto delete any additional paragraphs and merge everything into the header. Breaking things down into individual sections makes it easier for others to locate information insteead of wading through a bunch of non related information. Using the vgcats article I would think that would be the one to be trimmed, as the sections seem to mostly be about flash in the pan, and 1/2 made content (the animated series for instance), doesnt even have 1 episode, where as cad premium has 2 seasons and 2 editions of dvd available. The section on cad premium is 2 sentances, the section on vgcats is 6 with a cast list. Mind you there is a seperate article for cad premium, but even that only contains 3 sentances and the episode list. If anything we need expansion of the sections, not deleting everything as &quot;useless&quot;. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:3px solid #CD0000;padding:3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Knowledgeum|&lt;b&gt;Knowledgeum&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Knowledgeum|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFFFF;background:#CD0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 07:10, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

: As the section was discussed on the talk page before it was even added to the article I don't see any reason why it shouldnt have its own small paragraph. The difference between this one and the related comics in the vgcats article are that this one is current, 2 of the 4 comics are no longer maintained, 1 has its own article, and the other is like the sillies which is a spinoff, but of ctrl+alt+del itself. It is now a daily addition to the website, it appears to address some of the &quot;common critism&quot; the regular comic has. Removing every sentance that doesnt have a source on the end of it seeems exceedingly counter-productive. If you want to source every single sentance in the entire article you are welcome to it, I seem to recall the same issue for the CAD Premium section being removed as &quot;unneeded, not sourced&quot;. I would also have to ask how the paragraph was filled with &quot;mostly useless&quot; information. The 4 sentances that made that paragraph included the information on what the addition was, describing the difference between the new and the regular, aswell as the description of what a &quot;daily&quot; strip is to a regular comic. If you could identify the useless information we could work towards a consensus. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:3px solid #CD0000;padding:3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Knowledgeum|&lt;b&gt;Knowledgeum&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Knowledgeum|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFFFF;background:#CD0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 20:53, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

The &quot;Webcomic of the Week&quot; awards are utter flotsam, and have been deleted. The criticism are from the creator of Penny Arcade, a noted peer, and a professional critic. They are valid. The three nominations for Outstanding Comic/Gaming Comic are perfectly acceptable. People are going to have to come to terms with the fact that the comic that they love/hate may not be loved/hated in the wider sphere.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/195.12.230.131|195.12.230.131]] ([[User talk:195.12.230.131|talk]]) 12:27, 14 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;



If joystix isn't a notable site, why are we including an interview from it? The &quot;only a small minority votes&quot; logic is nonsense, as all polls follow that logic. 

Now I agree these aren't the most notable of praises,  (Penny Arcade is more popular and thus there can be more notable ones (this is to answer the guys who state that they would add non notable awards to articles with more popular subject matter)) however neither are our critics, the cross haw guy bashes basically bashes every critical acclaimed game, but is his opinion included on articles of popular games? No! Instead more notable gaming authorities are referenced... Lacking such a critic for this article, we reference him instead, by the same logic since there is no very popular authority on webcomics we include the joystiq awards. --[[User:Armanalp|Armanalp]] ([[User talk:Armanalp|talk]]) 16:24, 14 October 2008 (UTC)
: Again, I wanted to point out this is flawed logic.

Just to respond to the above suggestion that the current page protection was requested by Thrindel or Knowledgeum: I instituted the protection, and I did so entirely of my own volition.  I've never had any off-wiki communication with other editors about this article, and if you peruse my on-wiki communication you'll find nothing like the situation that you suggest.  As to the suggestion that vandalism proves that the article is unbalanced, I have to disagree: as I understand it (I have no strong opinions about this comic strip and never read it), there are a large number of people who, for whatever reason, intensely dislike this comic and especially its author.  That they are rather dedicated in using this page for defamation doesn't prove anything about the article; it only proves that there are a lot of people who want to use this page to defame Tim Buckley.  In fact, your line of reasoning essentially encourages vandalism, because it tells vandals &quot;Hey, if you don't like how a page reads, you just need to vandalize it a lot and we'll conclude that it's somehow unbalanced&quot;.  As always, I take no positions in any content disputes on this article (aside from egregious policy violations).

:The last &quot;vandal&quot; that you dealt with on this page was user 86.46.208.159, whose post contained nothing but his own opinions and suggestions which happened to reflect the majority of users who edit the article negatively. He laid out his reasons for feeling the need to change the page thus and you deleted it and pronounced it vandalism. This does not fill me with confidence that you act with an unbiased mind towards this article, or treat the views of the registered users evenly with unregisted ones. The recent vandalism on the actual article can be avoided by editing the article to be more reflective of it's subject matter, rather than locking a public page. Wikipedia is not an old boys club; if the majority view is that something should be changed then it should be changed. The fact that you choose to interpret this as me okaying vandalism is a little insulting. The fact of this subject matter is that is and has been the subject of satire, parody and piss-take across the web due to it's art, it's dialogue and it's infamous storyline. The last piece of vandalism on the main page drew reference to this and the artist's penchant for using image-searched backgrounds. The revert before that was for &quot;fancruft&quot; and yet accuratly provided more information on the characters that was relevant (the source of one character's name, for one) and could be readily quoted in the comic. Further reverts also centred around relevant &quot;fancruft&quot;. Any entry which is blatant vandalism, such as the occasional insult against the author or characters, should of course be removed, but much could be done to prevent this without the knee-jerk approach of locking the page. I remain unhappy in how this page has been edited both from the occasional vandal and from regular user, and I see little reason not to include further sections to mitigate future disputes.

First off, thanks to Nilzy for standing up for me.  I would have postd something earlier, but my net's been down for a while.  It's good to know that there are people on wikipedia that are freindly and ASSUME GOOD FAITH.  It's also good to know that others are getting annoyed by the censorship that goes on around here.  My comments were not vandalism, as I've explained, nor where they personal attacks, nor where they directly attacking Tim Buckley, as it's not really an attack to merely state ones opinion on the talk page, especially if backed by evidence, as long it stays there.  I say again, the reception section is filled with mostly criticism, because most reliable sources don't like CAD or Tim Buckley.  The sources agree, so don't delete my posts saying so.

It's worth mentioning CAD has ripped off a number of other webcomics in its lifetime, sometimes even directly. This should be added to a retitled &quot;Criticism&quot; section.

: How is it critism if something were to rip something else off as you state? That is completely OR and wouldnt even belong in a critism section if it was worth mentioning. Its not critism to copy something, and as we've been down the road on OR and the reception section you have to provide reliable third party sources on the &quot;ripped off&quot;, aswell as the notability of that information. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:3px solid #CD0000;padding:3px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Knowledgeum|&lt;b&gt;Knowledgeum&lt;/b&gt;]] : [[User_talk:Knowledgeum|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#FFFFFF;background:#CD0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:49, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

Let me put this another way:  many people believe that Buckley ripped-offed artists.  But until someone noteworthy says so, then he didn't.

Also, to Knowledgeum: I have yet to hear the pharse &quot;rip-off&quot; being used as anything but as negative criticism of any work, for example, see the arguement of Pantera versus Exhorder, Bill Hicks versus Denis Leary, etc. They clearly have sections on their respective pages on wikipedia. I'm not saying the CAD article should have one, I'm just saying that stating that Buckley ripped off other comics ''is'' a form of critisicm.  

Please note that when someone labels my post in a discussion that was meant to be explanatory, as vandalism, I don't really care who calls it vandalism.  Mods are not some fictional superior race.  They know all the rules and are experts at abiding by them, but they are still human. This is not a personal attack.  If you can't reply to my statement then leave it, Knoweldgeum.  Stop reverting it.  Nothing of what I said was BLP.  I merely stated something that is generally believed.  I never suggested it be added to the article.[[Special:Contributions/86.46.208.159|86.46.208.159]] ([[User talk:86.46.208.159|talk]]) 11:07, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

== Mike &quot;Gabe&quot; Krahulik comment ==

I put in a comment from this fellow, who was quoted in an inteview with Joystiq to say &quot;I think he's an art criminal.&quot; It's a comment on the artistry from a respected webcomic artist, and it's from the same interview that the comment with &quot;Tycho&quot; is from. However, it was reverted because &quot;it's a personal attack on a person, not the comic.&quot;

I'm going to go right ahead here and disagree, but I can see a possible minor (And stupid) edit war coming from this. The comment is 1. Directly referring to the artwork, 2. Although it does refer to the artist, it is still in reference to his profession and not his personal life et al, and 3. Would expand the small &quot;reception&quot; section.

Anyway, I have reverted the comment back into the page, but I've invited the original reverter to discuss it here if they feel there is an issue here. [[User:Gekedo|Gekedo]] ([[User talk:Gekedo|talk]]) 16:30, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

:The comment is directly referring to the artist, not the comic. There is nothing about that statement that suggests it pertains directly to the comic, and the author does artwork outside of the comic. If he had said &quot;The artwork in the comic is awful&quot;, it would be in the article. Krahulik's opinion about the artist is not relevant to the article about the comic (Krahulik's statement is also unexplained- we don't know exactly what he's getting at or inferring. The use of the word &quot;criminal&quot; is really strong and open to misinterpretation). This is also the reason why we only used half of the comment from Holkins. Personal insults about the author are not relevant to an article about the comic, especially when they don't contain any language that can be interpreted as reception of the comic itself. Holkins directly references a storyline from the comic and his dislike of it, which is why it was included. It's a reception section about the comic, not the author.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:48, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

::: I see the point you're making Gekedo, but I think we're looking at the statement differently. To me it looks like his opinion of the artist, and it's being added to a reception section about how the comic is received. Yes, perhaps the two are linked, but Buckley is also an artist outside of CAD. Krahulik's comment lacks any real substance or explanation. If he had said &quot;I think the art in the comic is criminal&quot; then there'd be no argument. He'd clearly be expressing that he doesn't enjoy the artwork in the comic (albeit in a crude and insulting fashion). But his comment as stands is a hair's breadth away from &quot;I don't like the guy&quot;. What next, we add Tycho's &quot;I think he's the antichrist&quot; comment? I'm having trouble seeing how these sort of additions benefit the article, which is supposed to be about the comic strip, not whether or not these two guys like the artist or not.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:26, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

:::: You are going to have to come to the realization that this comic has more critics than fans among it's peers. There is ample reason to add in the ''entire'' section of that interview that deals with the comic, but I am content that the comment about the author's art is both pertinent and warranted. The artist's sole entry in Wikipedia is the article for their comic. The artist mention is the ''sole'' artist for the comic. Your arguements appear to be verging on nitpicking and purposefully not seeing the obvious. Their art has come under attack before, there is no reason not to mention it.

To me they sound sarcastic in the interview, it goes from Joystiq referring to it as the &quot;community backlash&quot;, to Gabe referring to him as an &quot;art criminal&quot; and then to Tycho referring to him as the &quot;anti-christ&quot; and the story to the &quot;fourth horse of the apocalypse&quot;.

:They are relevant to the notability the comic has achieved, that the author is asked to lecture about the comic at a college, or asked to provide his opinion as the writer of a video game comic to an article on CBS about video game violence. Both are directly linked to the comic, and his role as the comic's author.

:: The author giving a university lecture and an interview with a website about Jack Thompson's opinions on videogame violence are flotsam. It sounds like unabashed crowing.

:::Nilzy, please don't start just whittling this article away piecemeal. It can't be done both ways- you can't, in one instance, say &quot;this comment is about the author, but it applies to the comic and the article&quot; and in another instance say &quot;oh, these are just things the author has done, and they don't have anything to do with the comic&quot;. These are not just random facts about the author's personal life, they are directly related to the comic, the recognition the comic has achieved, and his role as its creator.

:::I disagree that the author needs his own Wiki page. He hasn't done anything, that I'm aware of, outside of CtrlAltDel that is notable. Anything notable about CtrlAltDel can simply be added to this article about CtrlAltDel. That includes (as apparently has been decided) things that regard the author in the capacity of being the strip's creator. Being invited to lecture at a university, or having CBS ask your opinion are not everyday things. CBS did not ask his opinion just for the hell of it, they asked his opinion because (and it says this in the article), due to his comic, they viewed him as not only a gamer, but as &quot;a member of video game culture&quot;. That's because of his work on the comic. Same thing with the university lecture, I would imagine.

:::Furthermore, they are solidly sourced, and presented in a NPOV fashion. Nobody is &quot;crowing&quot; over anything. The article simply presents information (interesting and pertinent information at that) related to CtrlAltDel. Could the article survive without it? Of course. But does having it there benefit the overall article? Yes. It doesn't need to be removed just because it's not about how someone thinks its the &quot;antichrist&quot;.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:47, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Some points.

:::There is no &quot;whittling away of the article piecemeal.&quot; There is no reason for me to arbitrarily remove parts of this article I dislike. Nor is there a reason to be sympathetic to your views, Thrindel. There is a marked difference between noted and repeated criticism from a peer on an artist's artwork when he is the sole artist on the article, and documentation of the artist speaking on a website about a matter completely unrelated to the article. Unless you wish to purport that the article itself is in fact a deep and longrunning criticism of the nature and effect of videogame violence. The articles in question are sourced yes, but this does not make them relevant. They do not have to be worded in a particular manner to sound like flattery; their inclusion in a document where they are completely irrelevant ''but for that reason'' is evidence of that. Saying that speaking at a university is kept in  &quot;because it denotes the fame of the comic&quot; is flattery. There are no such examples of similar flotsam on the Penny Arcade or PVP pages, or indeed any other article of similar note. Furthermore, there is obviously no concensus on them being kept in and by now several users on both this page and the history page have expressed concern over both this and the content of the pieces. There is no reason not to keep the Digital Overload segment, as that is indeed pertinent. A random interview on videogame violence bears no connection to the comic; the author could be giving a lecture on Neo-Nazi discrimination and it would not be relevant. If he were talking about the article itself it may be ''relevant'' but a random interview is still not pertinent to the article. If he had been asked to speak about the article ''itself'', then yes, absolutely this would have been pertinent. It is not.

:::Secondly, as previously stated there is no reason not to make a page for the author himself and include these details there. You do not wish to. That is your opinion, but that is ''not a defense to keep these articles in''.

:::Thirdly the segment itself should, as has been said and has in fact been ''done'' at least once, be renamed. [[User:Nilzy|Nilzy]] ([[User talk:Nilzy|talk]]) 12:30, 19 November 2008 (UTC)

==(Relative) Lack of criticism of subject matter==
As I stated on the 4th August (Near the bottom of the criticism segment), I feel, and I quote:

&quot;Critisism by others who are in the field should be perfectly acceptable, as it constitutes the closest we can get to a work being reviewed by its peers. (Ben Crowshaw included, even though ZP is what he is now known for) either:

    * In posts by them on their forums/news sections (note: other forum members do not count)
    * Either directly, or through allusion in an established webcomic
    * Personal blog posts by webcomic authors critising a particular person in the field's work.

At the very least, if sources cannot be taken from a self-published website, the webcomics main pages included, to provide critical views held by the peer's of the subject of the article, then they should note be allowed to flesh out the article beyond the basics (for webcomics this would be the characters, and any arcs, but anything beyond that, e.g., Penny Arcade's &quot;Child's Play&quot;, would have to have information acquired from a different source.)

For instance, If Randall Munroe of xkcd writes on his &quot;blag&quot; about the faults of CAD, this should be seen as a usable source, as the criticism comes from someone established in the same, or in a similar field and, as I mentioned above, constitutes something similar to the work being reviewed by the peers of the articles subject matter. forum posts by those in a notable position in the field should also be considered, however, those by other members of their forum should not, unless they are also established Webcomic artists and have been proven as being so. this way, we can make sure that an article would be able to portray criticisms from others in the field. This way, we can make sure that articles on many niche fields are much more balanced.&quot;

Now, while Thrindel has managed to explain away this point previously (and others just as strong and as articulate) by making reference to screeds of Wiki legislature, I feel that he has forgotten the rule which (judging by the explanatory essay on said rule, was &quot;The first rule they considered&quot;) is &quot;If a rule prevents you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore it.&quot;

In my opinion, I feel that the limitations that the SPS rule enforces on this article, amongst others in similarly niché fields far outweigh its benefits in certain parts. most notably, the criticism section of this article. due to this, I feel that any  criticisms of the work in question, by the creator of the work's peers:
    * In posts by them on their forums/news sections (note: other forum members do not count)
    * Either directly, or through allusion in an established webcomic
    * Personal blog posts by webcomic authors critising a particular person in the field's work.
should placed in the article's criticism section should be protected by &quot;Ignore all rules&quot; on the grounds that, in parts of this particular article, SPS is at a detriment to the informativeness of this article, and by extension, wikipedia as a whole.

: I'm not sure this is the appropriate place to campaign for sweeping changes to Wikipedia's policies.

::I didn't say that I was campaigning for change any more, and as said, rules and polices get in the way of improving the article, the should be ignored according to the ignore all rules policy, which goes above and beyond all others. if the content isn't up to wiki quality standards (posts by jimbo jones of 378, no relation avenue on  a webcomic's forum, as opposed to say, a post made by a webcomic artist on their own blog), then I am perfectly sure that it will be removed, but SPS should be ignored here, where the rule actively acts in to the detriment of this article being over-weighted to the positive; and anyway, the webcomic artists' blogs for the most part are verifable to be theirs, and the blogs are notable enough in their own field and following for [[WP:V]] and [[WP:N]] to not be a significant problem. [[WP:BLP]] only comes in to it if someone were to post Buckley's home address, or other sensitive information which would have no place in an encyclopaedic article; not a legitimate criticism of his work

::: This article is not &quot;overweighted to the positive&quot;. If you see some language that you feel is biased in some way, then present it here and we can discuss some alternate wording.

::: I disagree that we need to start ignoring Wikipedia policies just so that we can add some random webcomic artists saying &quot;I don't like this comic&quot;. That doesn't improve the article in any way. If their opinions were really that notable, we'd have appropriate third party sources for them.

:::: We're not adding random webcomic artists saying &quot;I don't like this comic&quot; though. We are adding comments on the material made by others in the field, which, without ignoring [[WP:SPS]] we cannot do as, despite your claims to the contrary, would have little in the way of third party coverage as the webcomics field is a niché genre; Denial of that point is very, very naive.

::::yes the language may be somewhat balanced at the moment, but knowing this article's history, I doubt it will stay that way for very long, which is why I am trying to make [[WP:IAR]] prominent on this page before any edits take place. plus, ignoring SPS would work both ways, if CAD is praised on a prominent webcomic artist's blog, then it could go on here as well. Besides that, the reception shown barely scratches the surface of some of the criticisms made of CAD.

::::N.B. I wish to make clear that the comment about bias towards the positive was made after a glance at the article, was coloured slightly by reads of previous edits was unrepresentative of the article. that was a mistake. however, the main focus of this section (protection for Criticism or praise made by notable artists in the genre under [[WP:IAR]] ) is still a valid one.

Sorry, why can't these be added? Last time I checked, they were by far more notable web comics and the majority wanted them added - WITH GOOD REASON as well.

: The comments/criticisms from experts in the field, from notable subjects/third party sources, have been added to the article. Creating a webcomic doesn't make someone an &quot;expert&quot; in the field, nor does it make their opinions on the subject notable. Political cartoons in newspapers far more notable than webcomics parody subjects far more notable than webcomics every day, and yet we're not filling up various articles with lists of these parodies. In general, they're not that important or notable. To reiterate my earlier point, we don't add a link to the Super Mario Bros article every time a gaming webcomic parodies the game.

: If a parody is accompanied by something notable, then we'd definitely add it. As an example, I'd offer Penny Arcade's Strawberry Shortcake comic strip. Mention of it is listed on the Strawberry Shortcake article, not just because Penny Arcade parodied it, but because there was a documented legal controversy surrounding it.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:09, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

::I'm not sure about a general &quot;Parodies&quot; section, but a section about the notorious &quot;Miscarriage&quot; storyline is a serious consideration. I don't think any other comic has received such an enormous amount of attention from one single comic. That storyline alone has become one of the defining features of the comic, has generated an enormous amount of controversy and parody and the the Krahulik interview actually contains mention of it directly. I'm sure further peer comment wouldn't be hard to find.[[User:Nilzy|Nilzy]] ([[User talk:Nilzy|talk]]) 22:19, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

:::The article has mentions from two notable subjects, and third party publications, that directly refer to the topic of that story arc. Taking a number of standalone parodies and using them to say &quot;this has become one of the defining features of the comic&quot; or &quot;has generated an enormous about of controversy&quot; is synthesis, a form of original research. Taking multiple sources and combining them to make a statement which is not explicitly reached in any of the sources. There may have indeed been a lot of controversy about the story on a certain level, but that controversy doesn't seem to exist on the level of critical review from established experts or third party sources.

::::No, it is not. There is a virtual library of parody of the article online from other webcomics and photoshops and so forth relating to one strip alone, there are essays written on the storyline both praising it and ridiculing it, from peers, critics and the general public, far more than the few listed as you falsely claim. Considering you were not in favour of those few being listed considering you didn't consider ''them'' relevant this is an interesting view for you to take. It is a large source of debate.

When I look at the &quot;Bee Arrow Up&quot; section, I see 2 users disagreeing and 3 wanting it added - with Thrindel pushing the &quot;it's not criticism&quot; card AGAIN, and Knowledgeum missing the point completely. No one said it WAS criticism, it's a bit of FUN that adds to the notability of the comic in question. And since it's from a rival, I'm guessing it is in fact notable.

: I think you may be confusing notability with popularity. Creating a parody of something doesn't add to its notability unless there is something there that makes it worth mentioning. To use the example from earlier, the Penny Arcade Strawberry Shortcake comic mention would not be in the Strawberry Shortcake article if it had just been a regular old comic. That there was a bit of a legal fiasco which then made the parody notable (worth mentioning). Penny Arcade, CtrlAltDel, VGCats etc have parodied hundreds of video games, and I wouldn't say that those parodies contribute to the notability of those games. I certainly wouldn't add a link to them in the game's wiki article.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:35, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

: No, I wasn't comparing the two, I was giving an example of how parodies alone are not generally considered important or notable, by pointing out that Mario (or Super Marios Bros), one of the most recognized video game characters in popular culture, has no fan-crufty list of various parodies, of which there have no doubt been hundreds across all sorts of different media. An encyclopedia article is meant to be a summary of important, accepted knowledge on a subject, not an exhaustive list of every possible detail.--'''[[User:Thrindel|&lt;font color=#866fc2&gt;Thrindel]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Thrindel|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#beaee7&quot;&gt; Talk &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:35, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

The article has exactly one meaningful independent third-party sourced footnote, and that one refers to Buckley making $7000 from his web-comic -- which is the opposite of notability.

:I guess so. But it still perplexes me. I've never heard of wikipedia leading to somebody's reputation being torn apart. For example, let's say that on another webcomic has a wiki article where someone posts criticisms and attacks on the work and its creator(s). I don't think there's a need for said creator to set up protection for their wikipedia article. It'll be removed either way. There's nothing that'll be potentially damaging by just leaving it there.

== competition / artist conflict ==

I have spent the better part of the morning reading through all of the content of the various talk and edit summaries for this article, and I am astonished. I think it's been going on long enough people have lost sight of the original arguments. The irony is that the arguments that have happened between artists in the medium of web comic (specifically the above noted arguments between Buckley and the Penny Arcade creators) have become subject matter for even more baseless and pointless arguments. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and as a neutral source, I don't see a problem with documenting those opinions. The only problem is the following (quoted from WP:Verifiability) : &quot;Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for fact-checking. Such sources include websites and publications expressing views that are widely acknowledged as extremist, or promotional in nature, or which rely heavily on _rumors and personal opinions_.&quot; We see the same conflict between artists in every medium. Graphic Novels have Alan Moore vs. Frank Miller. Recently, another web comic creator (Ryan Sohmer of Least I Could Do) pointed out the conflict between gaming and non-gaming web comics. The issue therefore becomes: while these are real and true conflicts, they are populated on both sides by people who consciously (and subconsciously) wish for their side to &quot;win.&quot; In this case, in a matter of opinion, there are no winners. Everyone comes out covered in muck. The only solution is to simply adhere to the guidelines. You can document the opinion of an artist about another artist, but ONLY on that artist's page (if it exists, which in this case it does not) and provided it is from a verifiable source (which due to personal opinion and subjectivity precludes most blogs, and most forums, because of the lack of fact-checking). So, obeying wikipedia's guidelines, I think that the comment had to do with the artist, but because of something the artist did in his comic (the miscarriage plot). As long as it's put in that context, and cited to appropriate interview page (which is a verifiable source of the quote), it's acceptable to document. But any judgement calls on how valid that opinion is are absolutely prohibited. On a personal note, I don't believe in artist competition. When South Park took a blind shot at Family Guy, fans who had enjoyed both shows polarized, and it cost both sides crossover audience. People who already preferred one or the other just strengthened their viewpoints, and I think the same thing has happened with Penny-Arcade and Ctrl+Alt+Del. I enjoy both for different reasons, but I have a hard time enjoying Penny-Arcade now that they've behaved in a way that at the very least could be considered infantile, and at the most hateful and jealous. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but I'll quote the things said at the beginning of a talk page. &quot; Be polite - Assume good faith - Avoid personal attacks -Be welcoming.&quot; I think if you can't obey all four of those, take a break. You're too personally invested, and you'll make decisions based on your own opinions, which is NOT your job as an editor here. --[[User:NateDSaint|NateDSaint]] ([[User talk:NateDSaint|talk]]) 15:08, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

:Um, not so sound rude, but how is this relevant to any current discussion topics or current proposed alterations to the article?

:I apologize for not seeming timely. I found this article talk page via links from forums on both sides of the issue dated as early as yesterday.

::Don't take my initial comment as being rude, which I suppose it might seem more so if it is largely directed at &quot;visiting parties&quot;, so to speak.

:::I didn't take what you said as being rude, but perhaps a bit ironic, in that you claimed my message was unnecessary and then went on to say that discussion of this topic is pointless anyway, as vandalism and original research should just be reverted instead of discussed... in your discussion of what I said. : ) In any case, this isn't a forum, and I didn't mean to grandstand or point out my own opinions, but rather suggest that future changes be based on verification of these sources, and then objective decisions on whether to report them. There is still a good bit of discussion on NEW topics (not just the miscarriage episode) that are becoming contentious issues in the webcomic community. In any case, just bringing up the topic and reminding people of the suggestion to be polite, welcome, avoid personal attacks (including against your subject matter in this case) and to assume good faith, which was another issue discussed further up (though I assume since it hasn't been brought up much lately it's either resolved or quiet enough to be considered resolved).

::::Well if you haven't, you might take note of the previous discussion both still here and in the archive.  I've personally tried to include more of the material that falls towards &quot;criticism&quot; simply based on the fact that it ''is'' out there and would be an inaccurate representation of the subject to do so.  The trouble is that I also work within the Wikipedia guidelines, and in this regard the guidelines decidedly work against me.  These leanings have also been, how shall we put it, &quot;abused&quot; by other editors in the past in regards to this article in particular (though it is nothing rare in general).
::::At any rate, yes, vandalism to the main page (and the recent vandal edit on the talk page that I removed) gets reverted.  Personally, if there is merit to the edit I will either note that a source is needed or that should be brought to the talk page.

::::I'm pressed for time or I would elaborate more.  At any rate, things are not black and white, but there are more shades of gray for people that don't make a habit of vandalism or near-vandalism, and topics that people put thought into while discussing will generally get more elaborate feedback. --[[User:Human.v2.0|Human.v2.0]] ([[User talk:Human.v2.0|talk]]) 13:50, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Might I suggest that, before adding a Notability tag, we at least spend a few seconds researching the issue? Thanks. --[[User:Ks64q2|Ks64q2]] ([[User talk:Ks64q2|talk]]) 00:33, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
:Might I suggest that before removing a Notability tag, you use references that have at least the ''slightest'' relevance to where you attempt to use them?  If you want to use that one (and I believe it was removed once long ago, as having very little merit to the article itself, but don't quote me on that) then you're going to have to use it in a manner than makes sense.  You can't just toss a reference into a random spot and say &quot;hey, I have references!&quot;  What you did was essentially put in an external link (something unrelated and undiscussed in the article, and certainly not relevant to that section) with a reference tag, and that's not really the same thing as adding a reference. --[[User:Human.v2.0|Human.v2.0]] ([[User talk:Human.v2.0|talk]]) 13:03, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
::Hmm. Not to start a fight over an article on an Internet Web Comic, heh, I just happened across the page and noticed the tag on it. As an Inclusionist, it's a pet peeve of mine that people slap those preparations for PROD without bothering to improve the article. Here, you've spent more time deleting the reference and writing this to me, again, than it'd take you to properly reference that source. Sorry- looking through your history, I see you're considerably more experienced an editor than I, so I think it'd be pretty simply for you to fix that. The reference pertains to the article fine as near as I can tell from WP:SOURCE' I was attempting to throw a few on there until I had time to come back and address this properly; since you don't seem interested in doing so, I will.

:::Oh, no arguments intended.  One of the things I made note of is that I believe this was a link that was trimmed with other superfluous info about Mr. Buckley; material that might have been usable on an article based on him, but has little to no merit here. *shrug*  No one is using the tags for a future PROD, and I don't believe an unbiased PROD would work, but these are still issues.  There's a glut of issues with this article (though considerably less so in the past), and while it's quite true that I could probably scrounge up some new material it's just not terribly high priority for me.  I keep tabs on changes and try to tweak what I can, but most of the issues I've worked on in the past have simply been to trying and keep the POV neutral here.
:::Summary.  Room for improvement?  Of course.  Desire and/or time to devote to it personally?  Not a high priority.  Still trying to keep it as-good if not better?  Yup. --[[User:Human.v2.0|Human.v2.0]] ([[User talk:Human.v2.0|talk]]) 19:19, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
