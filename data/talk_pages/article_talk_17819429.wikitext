This entire article is pretty unorganized. I'd love to see it in a better place with some justified sources so we can remove some of the Citation needed tags. There are a lot of unjustified claims on this page, I feel. We need a &quot;host&quot; section because it talks of various hosts in various spots of the article. I also hid a sentence that is too poorly written to understand the meaning. Hopefully we can restore the page to a reputable spot. I'll add an IMDb link with a small addition to get the ball rolling.
