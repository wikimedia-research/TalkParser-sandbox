=={{{header-text|Notability of [[:Micah Orion Miller]]}}}==
A tag has been placed on [[:Micah Orion Miller]], requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag) and leave a note on [[Talk:Micah Orion Miller|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  [[User:Sjb90|Sjb90]] 05:56, 14 June 2007 (UTC)
