Hello, Limcba21, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Limcba21|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Samuel Lim]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Samuel Lim]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Samuel Lim]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion,&quot; which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Samuel Lim|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 14:27, 24 June 2011 (UTC)

== June 2011 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from writing autobiographical articles, as you did at [[:Samuel Lim]]. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|article about yourself]] is ''strongly'' discouraged; if you create such an article, it may be deleted. All edits to articles must conform to our policies on [[Wikipedia:No original research|no original research]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], and avoid [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. Please remember that Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_social_networking.2C_or_memorial_site|not a personal webspace provider]]. If your achievements are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. (See [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]].) Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 14:28, 24 June 2011 (UTC)

*Sorry, but a young man whose article includes a list of the music schools he hopes to attend is still at the [[WP:UPANDCOMING|up and coming]] stage of his career, and as an [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]] Wikipedia only covers people and things that are [[WP:N|already established]]. The entry requirements for a Wikipedia article are explained at [[WP:ARTIST]] and [[WP:MUSICBIO]]. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 14:36, 25 June 2011 (UTC)
