==Your userpage==
I have deleted your user page. It is intended for '''basic''' information about yourself or your Wikimedia-related activities. Although a lot of leeway is allowed in personalizing your user page, it is [[WP:NOT#HOST|not a personal website, blog, or social networking medium]], nor should it be used to promote yourself, or host a [[WP:FAKEARTICLE|fake article]], CV, or lengthy biography.

Please don't be offended, and please feel welcome here. I encourage you to help build the encyclopedia. If there is anything you ever need, just ask. Best wishes, [[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|talk]]) 08:25, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
