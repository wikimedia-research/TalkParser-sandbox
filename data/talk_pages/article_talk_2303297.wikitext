The article on [[Cardenio]] contains this line:
&quot;they may well have passed to William Warburton, who had worked with Theobald, and if 
they did, they probably perished at the hands of his infamous cook.&quot;
I was unable to find a reference in Warburton's article, though. If this cook is that infamous, perhaps someone could write a line or two?
