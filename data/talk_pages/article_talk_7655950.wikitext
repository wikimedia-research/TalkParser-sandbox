No problem, it's always good to tag articles; so we can all work on them together. [[User:Y control|Y control]] 00:17, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

{{unblock reviewed| How can you say I'm a &quot;sockpuppet.&quot; Ok, it was a joke, but putting up a long-dormant account on Editor Review does not make me the holder of that account does it? I assume that's why you think I'm a &quot;sockpuppet.&quot; Well, i'm not.|decline=Even if we accepted that far-fetched reasoning (have you ever even looked at the blocked user list and seen how many ''hours'' it would take to find that account?) your edits were still disruptive, causing extra work for dozens of volunteers. That's enough to see you blocked. -- [[User_talk:Redvers|➨ ]]&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Redvers|ЯEDVERS]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:04, 29 October 2006 (UTC)}}

:My question is how [[Special:Contributions/Hipster_Beatnik|a brand new user]] even knew about this indef-blocked user. Unless, of course, ... &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Daniel.Bryant|Daniel]][[Special:Random|.]][[User talk:Daniel.Bryant|Bryant]]'''&lt;/span&gt; 00:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

I just picked the name off the blocked users list.  It was a joke and I apologize, but I dont know the guy personally.
