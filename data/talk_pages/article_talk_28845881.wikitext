Hello, and '''''[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!'''''

Someone using this [[IP address]] has made unhelpful edits&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Potential superpowers]], which have been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]].  If you did this, in the future please try to contribute in a more constructive manner.  If you did not do this, you may wish to consider &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup&amp;returnto=Main_Page}} getting a username]&lt;/span&gt; to avoid confusion with other editors.

You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free, requires no personal information, and has many [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|benefits]].  Without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you.

Some good links for newcomers are:
*[[Help:Contents|Help contents]] - the main help page.
*[[Wikipedia:Quick guide|Quick guide]] - a &quot;cheatsheet&quot; listing the main editing commands.
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]

Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] on talk pages using four (~&amp;#126;~~); this will automatically produce your name and timestamp. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:TFOWR{{!}}my talk page]], or place &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;helpme}}&lt;/code&gt; on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. 

Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:Welcome-anon-vandal --&gt; [[User talk:TFOWR|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;TFOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#F00&quot;&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;]] 15:48, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
