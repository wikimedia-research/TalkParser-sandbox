== Yale Laundry Building GAN ==

Hi Grondemar. Sorry about the mixup. I didn't realize that my name was listed as one of the nominators. Actually, {{U|Another Believer}} is the sole nominator. I don't object to the nomination, but I think Another Believer is more able than I at the moment to respond to your suggestions and questions. I deleted my name from the nomination template just now to head off any further confusion. Thanks for doing the review. I have done a lot of reviews, mostly at PR but also a few at GAN, and I know they are time-consuming. [[User:Finetooth|Finetooth]] ([[User talk:Finetooth|talk]]) 04:14, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

I don't know if we will see any updates from the student or the professor on the article, but it would be a shame to have something reasonably close to GA status fail due to lack of interest.  If you can give me a few days I'll try to fix my comments and yours and improve the article to meet GA standards. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 20:33, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
:Sure, no problem.  I was waiting for a response from the professor or students before continuing the review, but if you want to take the article on, that works just as well. &lt;i&gt;[[User:Grondemar|&amp;ndash;]][[User talk:Grondemar|Grondemar]]&lt;/i&gt; 06:26, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

== GA review of SVU: Season 12 ==

Grondemar, 

Thank you for taking the time to review my GA nomination of [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)]]. I am currently working on addressing the concerns that you mentioned; however, I have a question on one of them that I was hoping you could answer for me. I left it [[Talk:Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)/GA1|on the talk page itself]], but I will post it here as well: 

Her death [that of Sonya Paxton] was shown in the episode itself; does this not count as a reference? Also, a quick Google search yielded no reliable sources for this, either, but I will do a more thorough search later if need be.

If you already had the page on your watchlist and were planning to answer it eventually, please feel free to remove this message. --[[User:Davejohnsan|Davejohnsan]] ([[User talk:Davejohnsan#top|talk]]) 17:56, 21 December 2011 (UTC)
:Update: I have one additional question that I've placed on the talk page. --[[User:Davejohnsan|Davejohnsan]] ([[User talk:Davejohnsan#top|talk]]) 19:21, 21 December 2011 (UTC)
::I will address your questions in a few days, probably after Christmas.  I'll need to read through all the sources again. &lt;i&gt;[[User:Grondemar|&amp;ndash;]][[User talk:Grondemar|Grondemar]]&lt;/i&gt; 21:11, 21 December 2011 (UTC)
:::Not a problem. In the meantime, I'll look through all the sources again to see if I can, perhaps, answer my own question. --[[User:Davejohnsan|Davejohnsan]] ([[User talk:Davejohnsan#top|talk]]) 21:59, 21 December 2011 (UTC)

Not sure if you've forgotten about this one, but you reserved the review a couple weeks back. I just stopped by to inquire about the status of the GA review. Thanks, [[User:Tyrol5|&lt;font color=&quot;#960018&quot;&gt;'''Tyrol5'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Tyrol5|&lt;font color=&quot;#960018&quot;&gt;[Talk]&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:25, 26 December 2011 (UTC)
:Actually, I did forget I tagged this one and didn't review it.  I'll take a look tonight. Sorry about that. &lt;i&gt;[[User:Grondemar|&amp;ndash;]][[User talk:Grondemar|Grondemar]]&lt;/i&gt; 23:53, 26 December 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks for reviewing the article; I appreciate it. I've addressed both your concerns at the GAN, so it should be good to go. Let me know if there are more issues.

== GA and ArticleHistory ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Maryland_Route_234&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=468434858] When you add a GAN to a {{tl|ArticleHistory}}, could you please use a full link (Talk:Maryland Route 234/GA1) rather than a relative link (/GA1). All the other links are full links, and this helps prevent broken links when pages are moved. People routinely forget to move subpages.
