[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Pinethicket|Pinethicket]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/163.6.193.33|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Computer worm]] because it did not appear constructive. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[WP:sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Pinethicket|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt; [[User:Pinethicket|Pinethicket]] ([[User talk:Pinethicket|talk]]) 19:34, 30 September 2014 (UTC)
