Hello 2601:0:4080:65:78C0:28FB:40B7:2CE2. It has been over six months since you last edited your [[WP:AFC]] draft article submission, entitled &quot;[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Doctor Shelby|Doctor Shelby]]&quot;. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Doctor Shelby|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note that Articles for Creation is not for indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia [[WP:mainspace|mainspace]].

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, you can request its undeletion by one of two methods (don't do both): 1) follow the instructions at [[WP:REFUND/G13]], ''or'' 2) copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Doctor Shelby&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, and click &quot;Save page&quot;. An administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt; [[User:HasteurBot|HasteurBot]] ([[User talk:HasteurBot|talk]]) 02:01, 1 February 2015 (UTC)
