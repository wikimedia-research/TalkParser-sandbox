== Your submission at [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation|Articles for creation]]: [[Draft:Dr. Harcharan Singh|Dr. Harcharan Singh]] (June 19) ==
&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #FCC; background-color: #F8EEBC; padding: 0.5em 1em; color: #000; margin: 1.5em; width: 90%;&quot;&gt; [[File:AFC-Logo_Decline.svg|50px|left]]Your recent article submission to [[WP:AFC|Articles for Creation]] has been reviewed! Unfortunately, it has not been accepted at this time.&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;The reason left by MatthewVanitas was:

{{divbox|gray|3=This is a good start, and Singh does indeed meet our [[WP:Notability]] benchmark for biographies.

The problem is you've provided zero [[WP:Sourcing]] whatsoever. Clearly, you don't have all these facts just memorized, you must be reading them somewhere. ''Tell'' the reader where you got this information from, so that they themselves can check it to be sure. I strongly suggest you read [[WP:Referencing for beginnners]] which will show you how to footnote an article.

Also, check out books.google.com since there are a number of works there you can peruse which verify facts about Singh, and you can use those as evidence to footnote claims here. Note you can instantly convert any GoogleBooks URL into a full Wikipedia footnote using http://reftag.appspot.com

Please add ''sourcing'', and also make sure to leave a blank line between paragraphs so they don't run together (I fixed that for you). 

Once you have added sourcing, please click Resubmit for your next review.|}} Please check the submission for any additional comments left by the reviewer.  You are encouraged to edit the submission to address the issues raised and resubmit &lt;u&gt;when they have been resolved&lt;/u&gt;.
