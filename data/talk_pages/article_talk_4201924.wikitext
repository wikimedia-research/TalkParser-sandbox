We gotta pare this thing down. This page is ginormous. [[User:Isopropyl|Isopropyl]] 07:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

In fairness, most of those references and callbacks are pretty essential to understanding the episode, and can (and have) easily be missed. The plotlines of this show tend to be rather complex, and frequently (as in this episode), there will be 4-5 storylines that all intertwine not only within the individual episodes, but over a span of multiple episodes as well. Would removing the regular cast, paring down the summary, and only having 3-4 quotes help? Also, sorry if I removed markup, I didn't realize that I did. --[[User:Vcalzone|Vcalzone]] 07:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

I'm not an expert on this show, but [[Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Television_episodes|this]] is a good start. I trust your judgment. Good luck! [[User:Isopropyl|Isopropyl]] 08:10, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

I agree with VCalzone, and not just because I started the page.  It's getting closer and closer to what I had imagined but couldn't do on my own.  One thing to consider, though: This episode has a list of season 2 eps with this one highlighted, while the season one episodes under construction have &quot;previous episode&quot; and &quot;next episode&quot; links.  I think we need to make that the same across the board.  --[[User:Leez34|Leez34]] 17:07, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

RE: Goofs: (During Gob's illusion, there is initially a small camera visible on the inside lid of the coffin. Later in the scene the camera is gone.)
In this scene Gob is holding the camera as he gets out of the coffin and puts it down on the shelf behind him. Can someone confirm this for belief or am I just seeing things?([[User:Ra-Ra-Rasputin|Ra-Ra-Rasputin]] 10:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC))

== Episode notes needed? ==

While I recognize that it is tricky to cite episode notes/references, etc., I think it's worth noting that every other Arrested Development episode page has this sort of uncited material, and as this is a show that hugely depends on references to other episodes and pop culture moments episode notes should certainly be added to this page.  I added some earlier today (and it appears others have in the past), but they were quickly deleted.  It might have seemed an irrelevant and lengthy edit, but this episode is rich in this sort of material and it is vital to understanding and appreciating the show in its entirety.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Benmitchelllewis|Benmitchelllewis]] ([[User talk:Benmitchelllewis|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Benmitchelllewis|contribs]]) 21:29, 22 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:It might be worth reviewing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(film)#Pop_Culture_Section this discussion], as while it is part of the Film project it seems pertinent. Aside from that my concerns would be that the material is inappropriate based on [[WP:CRUFT]], [[WP:TRIVIA]] and most significantly with regards to referencing, [[WP:VERIFY]], especially as without sourcing there's no evidence that the purported references are anything other than coincidence. Comparison to other articles for AD episodes may be more an indication that those articles also need improvement than that there are issues with this one. While I certainly can't fault people for appreciating (or wanting to appreciate) the show (I'm a fan myself), Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a fansite or IMDb.
