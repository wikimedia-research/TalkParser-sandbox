==List of M.I. High episodes synopses==

Hi! Thank you very much for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_M.I._High_episodes&amp;diff=601164093&amp;oldid=601157034 writing original episode synopses] at [[List of M.I. High episodes]]! Most of the synopses that wind up at this article are copy/pasted from the official BBC site, and from elsewhere. I have to delete those synopses for copyright considerations, and the result is a less useful article. So your write-ups are much appreciated. I don't get the show in my country, so it's difficult to help in this regard. If you get extra time to help clean up some of the existing copypasta, that would be a fantastic contribution. No pressure though. Regards, [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 16:14, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
