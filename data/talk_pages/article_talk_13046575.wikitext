There are many prominent and locally famous cliffjumping locations around the lake including The Rock, The Swallow Bay Cliff, and The Pillars.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.254.70.70|76.254.70.70]] ([[User talk:76.254.70.70|talk]]) 00:44, 23 May 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Lake Del Valle State Recreation Area?==
I am slowly working on the [[list of California state parks]] and came across [http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=537 Lake Del Valle State Recreation Area], which appears to be congruent with Del Valle Regional Park.  I can't find any source that confirms they're the same place or why there are two names with different management designations.  Does anyone have definitive information? -[[User:Mcghiever|McGhiever]] ([[User talk:Mcghiever|talk]]) 21:04, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
