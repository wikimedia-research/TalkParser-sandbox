== To the IP editor who keeps blanking sections of this article ==
I'm addressing you here since you appear to have a dynamic IP and it looks like you're not getting the messages left on the IP talk pages:

It seems that you might be the subject of one of our articles and are displeased with some of the contents.  See [[Wikipedia:Contact us/Article problem/Factual error (from subject)]] for a general overview of ways to get problems fixed (as well as an email address).  You can also mention specific problems on [[Talk: Jamie Spencer]] (this page) if you want specific mistakes corrected. 

The email address is info-en-q@wikimedia.org. The first thing you might be asked to do is to privately establish your identity.  [[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk: Toddst1|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:50, 12 November 2012 (UTC)
