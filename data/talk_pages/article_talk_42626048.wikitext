== Replaceable fair use File:Nabih berri2.jpeg ==
[[File:Ambox warning.svg|32px|left]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Nabih berri2.jpeg]]'''. I noticed that this file is being used under a claim of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|fair use]]. However, I think that the way it is being used fails the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|first non-free content criterion]]. This criterion states that files used under claims of fair use may have ''no free equivalent''; in other words, if the file could be adequately covered by a freely-licensed file or by text alone, then it may not be used on Wikipedia. If you believe this file is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:File:Nabih berri2.jpeg|the file description page]] and add the text &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{di-replaceable fair use disputed|&lt;your reason&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; '''below''' the original replaceable fair use template, replacing &lt;code&gt;&lt;your reason&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a short explanation of why the file is not replaceable.
# On [[File talk:Nabih berri2.jpeg|the file discussion page]], write a full explanation of why you believe the file is not replaceable.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media item by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license]], or by creating new media yourself (for example, by taking your own photograph of the subject).

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these media fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target=Philanthropist_1001&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, non-free media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006), per the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|non-free content policy]].  If you have any questions, please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:di-replaceable fair use-notice --&gt; [[User:Anon126|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #000&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fff&quot;&gt;Anon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0ff;&quot;&gt;126&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User:Anon126/R|notify me of responses!]] / [[User talk:Anon126|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Anon126|contribs]]) 05:38, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

==Sockpuppet investigation==
{{Ivmbox
|Hi. An editor has opened an investigation into [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sockpuppetry]] by you. Sockpuppetry is the use of more than one Wikipedia account in a manner that contravenes community policy. The investigation is being held at [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Rami.198678]], where the editor who opened the investigation has presented their evidence. Please make sure you make yourself familiar with [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/SPI/Guidance#Defending yourself against claims|the guide to responding to investigations]], and then feel free to offer your own evidence or to submit comments that you wish to be considered by the Wikipedia administrator who decides the result of the investigation. If you ''have'' been using multiple accounts (in a manner contrary to Wikipedia policy), please go to the investigation page and verify that now. Leniency is usually shown to those who promise not to do so again, or who did so unwittingly, but the abuse of multiple accounts is taken very seriously by the Wikipedia community.{{#if:|&amp;nbsp;[[User:LimitationsAndRestrictions495656778774|495656778774 ]] ([[User talk:LimitationsAndRestrictions495656778774|talk]]) 13:02, 8 August 2015 (UTC)}}
