==Merge results==
It is important to note that six pages, [[South Ridge 1]], [[South Ridge 2]], [[South Ridge 3]], [[South Ridge 4]], [[South Ridge 5]] and [[South Ridge 6]] have been merged into this article as as result of discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Dubai#Dubai skyscrapers: merger proposals]]. The associated talk pages were redirected to this talk page, as there was no content aside from project banners.
