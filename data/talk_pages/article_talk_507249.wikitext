Ethnic cleansing in the free state - Protestants in Republic of Ireland : New Statesman July 10, 1998

(Craig openly condoned discrimination against Catholics.)
I`m not sure the above is quite true - he did however state: 
July 12 1932 - [[James Craig]]

&quot;ours is a Protestant Government and I am an Orangeman&quot;
As NI Prime Minister, at Orange demonstration at Pontzpass, Co. Armagh

April 24 1934 - James Craig (Lord Craigavon)
&quot;I have always said that I am an Orangeman first and a politician and
member of this Parliament afterwards - They still boast of Souther
Ireland being a Catholic State.  All I boast of is that we are a
Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State&quot;
As NI Prime Minister, at Stormont.

and to put that in context

 Eamon de Valera Prime Minister of the Irish Free State / Irish Republic 1930

&quot;Justifying the sacking of a properly appointed librarian in Mayo, because, though highly qualified, she was a Protestant, [[de Valera]] argued in June 1930: &quot;I say the people of Mayo in a county where I think 98% of the population is [[Catholic]] are justified in insisting on a Catholic librarian.&quot; He went on to widen the issue indeed, and asserted: &quot;a [[Protestant]] doctor ought not to be appointed as a dispensary doctor in a mainly Catholic area.&quot;

(But De Valera was in Opposition before 1932. So he cannot be accused of making that decision regarding the librarian.)


[[Mayo County Council]] made the decision. But for the state's Opposition leader to back them unequivocally was definitely sectarian populism.

Not long after partition:-
During the debate on compulsory Irish, Deputy [[Wolfe]] (a Protestant)
protested:


&quot;I doubt if compelling people to learn is a good way of spreading the
language; it is a very difficult thing to compel an Irishman to do
anything.&quot; It is still a compulsory requirement to this day (2005) that you must speak fluent Irish to gain employment as a Civil Servant in the Republic of Ireland.



[[Yeats]] a prominent Southern Irish Protestant TD in the Dail / Irish Parliament gave the Government a warning:

&quot;If you show that this country, Southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North . . . You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation.&quot;

Quote: &quot;It is still a compulsory requirement to this day (2005) that you must speak fluent Irish to gain employment as a Civil Servant in the Republic of Ireland.&quot;

Not so. The compulsory element of Irish in schools was removed in April 1973 (see ''Compulsory Irish'' by Adrian Kelly), and was removed in 1974 as a requirement for the civil service.

Actually the ''Study'' of Gaelic is still compulsary in Irish Schools. All the so-called ''abolition of compulsary Irish'' did was to end the situation where if one failed Irish in theie exams one was deemed to have failed the entire exam ! And this wasnt a retroactive change either There are still many people in Ireland today who effectively have no educational qualifications whatsoever because they failed one Irish exam !.

The term 'Southern Ireland' is nonsensical, geographically and politically. That country simply does not exist. The term is Republic of Ireland.

Northern Unionism can not be predominantly Presbyterian as that would be insufficient to maintain a unionist majority.  The Presbyterians are the largest religious bloc, but the Church of Ireland is generally just as unionist and only a few percentage points below the size of the Presbyterians. [[User:MnJWalker|MnJWalker]] Also there is a geographical divide between Presbyterianism and Anglicanism with Presbyterianism being dominant in the North and East of Northern Ireland and Anglicans (Church of Ireland) being the dominant (Protestant) religion aross the rest of the Island. 

Some anonymous individual claims above that WB Yeats said &quot;this country, Southern Ireland&quot;. I'd like to see the evidence for Yeats's use of that loyalist term. His country was Ireland, a fact which he was very proud of.[[User:El Gringo|El Gringo]] 05:52, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

Admitidely ''Southern Ireland'' may not be a TECHNICALLY correct description of the Republic of Ireland (The most Northerly point of the Island being in ''the south'' and all that) however in the context of a discussion about Unionism or Nationalsm the term &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; is arguably more readily understood by people living outside (the island of) Ireland. It is certainly far less misleading than the widespread practice of referring to the Republic (as opposed to the Island as a whole) as &quot;Ireland&quot; (as enshrined in Article 4 of The Republic's 1938 constitution) or the even more confusing term ''Irish Republic'' unwittingly used by many Unionists (and others) to describe &quot;the south&quot;  when it actually refers to the notional ''All-Ireland'' republic to which nationalists aspire. And for a short period prior to the establishment of the ''free state'' there WAS an legal entity called &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; albeit largely existing on paper.

== The Taking of Ireland ==

Given the context of the sentence, I changed this back to the literal translation.  As a compromise however, I added the 'known as' comment.  There is no other &quot;Book of the Taking of Ireland&quot; to confuse this with, and the Wikilink points directly to the article in question.  The common 'translation' is also, ironically, part of historical revisionism. --[[User:Setanta747|Mal]] 08:02, 23 February 2006 (UTC)


==Small Island Property and Tax Law?==
I fail to see the logic behind:
&quot;Irish unionists opposed Home Rule for many reasons. Much of their support in southern and western Ireland (the provinces of Munster, Leinster and Connacht) came from landed gentry who feared that a nationalist assembly would introduce property and taxation laws more suitable to a small island than the laws imposed from Westminster, which were designed for a much larger area, the entire United Kingdom.&quot;
I fail to see how Ireland being a slightly smaller island than Britian is at all relevent. Other factors may have made UK law less just in Ireland than in Britian, but not island size. [[User:Matturn|matturn]] 02:00, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

&quot;I fail to see how Ireland being a slightly smaller island than Britian is at all relevent&quot;- This statement betrays a misunderstanding of the authors argument. Ireland at this point was part of the United Kingdom, or Britain. He was not comparing the size of Ireland with mainland Britain, rather Ireland with the entire United Kingdom-including the island of Ireland. 
I think that it is a fair point to argue that the United Kingdom in its entirety was a much larger area, and that a different set of property and taxation laws would plausibly be appropriate there than in a self-determined area the size Ireland.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/194.63.116.72|194.63.116.72]] ([[User talk:194.63.116.72|talk]]) 14:08, 7 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== The Troubles ==

This section begins with a reference to ''brutal killings'', to which are linked the British army and the police. I think that this is badly phrased, rather than deliberately incorrect. I've left it because I don't like trespassing on other people's pages, but I think that it could do with being looked at. --[[User:Major Bonkers|Major Bonkers]] 12:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
:The whole section seems a bit out of place to me. It is talking about the Troubles in general, and doesn't specifically relate to Unionism. [[User:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Stu'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''’Bout ye!''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Irish culture ==

Can anyone help me get my head around the following phrase?

{{cquote|Everyday life in Northern Ireland reflects the rest of the UK, sharing the same newspapers, roadsigns, postcodes etc. Irish culture, of course, influences the province as well.}}

It makes it sound like Northern Ireland is some sort of cultural blank slate, appropriating the culture of its next-door-neighbour, when in fact many &quot;Irish&quot; things are intrinsically bound up with Ulster and the north.  We wouldn't say Irish culture &quot;influences&quot; the Republic of Ireland, would we? [[User:MartinRobinson|Martin]] 00:29, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
:I see no reason for keeping the paragraph myself. [[User:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Stu'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Stumason|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''’Bout ye!''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

Most cultures are influenced by neighbouring cultures Northern Irish culture is heavily influenced by both Irish and British (mainly Scottish) cultures. Indeed Southern Irish culture is also influenced by British (mainly English) cultures and to a lesser extent that of the rest of the Anglosphere.


-The part that bothers me most is the term &quot;provence&quot;. Ulster has 9 counties, Northern Ireland has 6, therefore to call the country a provence (as so many often do) is inaccurate. [[User:EmpComm|EmpComm]] 20:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Protestants in the Irish Parliament ==
''There are four Protestants in the current Dáil: Seymour Crawford, Mildred Fox, Jan O'Sullivan and Trevor Sargent.''
What about Ivan Yates and Martin Manseragh ?
Im not sure how relevent this anyway. None of the 4 TD's (or 3 Senators) AFaIK are Unionists. In anycase a Southern neo-Unionist in this day and age is as likely to be Roman Catholic (or of &quot;other&quot; or no religion) as Protestant !
:  I've removed all that.  Ivan Yates is no longer a TD and Martin Mansergh is a Senator.  As none of them are Unionists, I don't think it's relevant. --[[User:Ryano|Ryano]] 09:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

==Inaccuracies==

This article is seriously bad in large areas. It mucks up terminology, makes sweeping generalisations, veers from a pro-republican bias (I should have known [[User:Lapsed Pacifist|Lapsed Pacifist]] had edited it!) to an over-the-top Unionist bias, then jumps between the two. It contains a lot of POV crap about &quot;neo-Unionists&quot; (except in Sinn Féin-speak there ain't no such thing). Oh gawd, it is so substandard and unencyclopaediac it is almost funny. BTW Ivan Yates is retired from the Dáil years ago!!! The fact that the article cannot even get ''that'' fact speaks volumes for how bad it is. And who the heck is so bad at spelling? ''Senete''??? For crying out loud! This article is a thorough embarrassment. [[User:Jtdirl|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green; background-color:pink&quot;&gt;'''Fear''ÉIREANN'''''&lt;/span&gt;]][[Image:Ireland-up.png|15px]]\&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Jtdirl|(caint)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 04:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

There IS such thing as a neo-Unionist. Not many but more than most people realise. I am a neo-Unionist although admitidely I no longer live in the Republic [[User:87.113.19.12|87.113.19.12]] 18:25, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

The first paragraph does state that &quot;the number of Unionists in what is now the Republic of Ireland declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant&quot; So wheres the dispute ? As for inaccuracies regarding spelling, numbers of representitives in parliament etc why dont you correct it instead of complaining about it in here ?
Oh and yes there are a few of us left. Southern Unionism may not exactly be fashionable (for now ?) but it certainly still exists [[User:194.165.161.133|194.165.161.133]] 13:13, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

This article is appalling.  It mentions the partition of Ireland without any attempt to put it into context, it's blatantly politically biased throughout.

:''This article is so terribly awful'' yada yada yada. (Sigh- I know this is going to inevitably need to more revert wars and accusations/counter-accusations of POV but what the heck....)

== Natives of Ulster ==

Could someone go to the foot of the article on [[Cruithne (people)]] and flesh out the Unionist notion described there, that Scots settlers in Ulster are descended from the original inhabitants of the province? Or is there a separate article on this matter?--[[User:Shtove|Shtove]] 17:13, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

: For aa start, I think you've misunderstood the history. The Cruthin are not &quot;Scots settlers in Ulster&quot;. Perhaps the article isn't quite up to scratch - I'll have a look at it. --[[User:Setanta747|Mal]] 23:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
::It looks a very ethnic-political proposition to me. As I understand it, there is a theory that the Scots who settled in Ulster in the 16th-17thC. are descended from the Cruithne, who formed the common, aboriginal population of Ulster and Scotland.--[[User:Shtove|Shtove]] 10:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

::: I've never heard this theory before. If you have a decent source, feel free to add it to the article with a citation though I suppose.
::: My understanding is that the Cruthin were a large tribe of people who may or may not have been pre-Celtic and lived in the British Isles some two- to two and a half thousand years ago onward. In the 1500-1600s (the 16th and 17th centuries), any people from Scotland would have been much more mixed because the tribes of previous millenia had been largely consolidated.
::: While there may be a substantial proportion of the British population that is descended from these people, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that these people are, each and every one of them, unionists, or Protestant (an 'invention' of the 16th century), or Scots. --[[User:Setanta747|Mal]] 21:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
::::I'm just inquiring, not asserting. I have no source for this, just a recollection of a political argument based on ethnicity to counter the Brits Out! line ie. loyalists would argue that since their Scots forebears (the planters) were descended from a population once common to Scotland and Ulster, then their presence in Ulster was justifiable ab initio. I'm not for it or agin it - just think it's notable and worth fleshing out, if in fact that is the gist of the argument. P.S. Leaving a message for [[User:El Gringo]] on my talk page is probably not the best way to reach him. Thanks.--[[User:Shtove|Shtove]] 16:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

::: Let me illustrate a point for you Shtove. The Irish folk hero Setanta has been hijacked by both Republicans and Loyalists and politicised. That does not mean that the myth never existed until these two polar opposite groups decided the character represented their respective 'cause'.
::: Some of the more stringent unionists, and probably many Loyalists too, use the idea of the Cruthin to demonstrate how the history of our peoples isn't as straightforward as 'native' and 'Planter'. Some go further than that.
::: The problem though, is that we're dealing with a pre-history society in the case of the Cruthin - very little is actually known about them. One theory is that they had lived as a matriarchial(sp?) society, as opposed to the Celtic culture's patriarcial society. Another is that they spoke with a pre-Celtic tongue. Another is that they arrived at the same time as Celts, or were themselves Celts.
::: We should probably note all of these theories, but I don't believe it is necessary to politicise it in terms of Catholics versus Protestants or nationalists vs unionists. Too many things are polarised in that way already, which only serves to further divide the people, rather than give us all some kind of common ground and mutual appreciation and understanding. It is wrong to dismiss something simply on the grounds that it is perceived to be, in mordern terms, of nationalist or of unionist import. Instead, we should just present the theories and/or facts, and let the reader formulate their own opinion, or do further research for themselves. --[[User:Setanta747|Mal]] 02:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
::::I'm not interested in polarisation. Not interested in common ground. Not interested in the history of the matter. I understand your point about [[Setanta]]. I understand use of the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. But I'd like to read a coherent statement of the political/ethnic theory that seeks to justify the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and the continued presence in Ireland of descendants of the Scots settlers. People are people, and being people they often tell themselves elaborate stories. So, what's the story?--[[User:Shtove|Shtove]] 23:11, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

==North of the island of Ireland==

Is there a politically neutral manner of referring to the North of the island of Ireland if one wants to include not only Northern Ireland but the northern part of the Republic, without implicitly passing comment on the legitimacy of Northern Ireland?--[[User:Lucifer(sc)|Lucifer(sc)]] 13:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

:If you're talking about the northern half of the island you could say &quot;north of [[Ireland]]&quot; but it will always be taken the wrong way, and so IMO shouldn't be use on Wikipedia. If you mean Northern Ireland plus [[Cavan]], [[Donegal]] and [[Monaghan]] then [[Ulster]] is acceptable. It would help if I knew what you were referring to the ''north of Ireland'' in relation of? Also if you're using north, south, east and west geographically then capitals are not required.

Since the Belfast agreement the term &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; is recognised by most people (including moderate nationalists) nowadays. Only hardline Irish Nationalists (&quot;republicans&quot;) Insist on referring to it as &quot;the six counties&quot; or even &quot;occupied Ireland&quot;. In casual conversation the terms &quot;the North&quot; and &quot;the South&quot; are widely accepted (despite the most Northerly point on the Island actually being in &quot;the South&quot;) but only makes sense when all the speakers are actually IN Ireland [[User:87.113.19.12|87.113.19.12]] 18:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

::: You probably need to provide some context. You could be referring to the the ''northern coast of Ireland'', or ''Ulster'', or ''Northern Ireland and border counties'' or ''the northern half of Ireland''.

Added citation needed to the following line.
Discrimination, however, took place, particularly in the areas of housing, employment and local government representation. The extent of such discrimination is disputed,[citation needed] and there was also widespread poverty among Protestants.

The fact that there was discrimination is undisputed as there is overwhelming evidence that there was. The added line (The extent of such discrimination is disputed) looks strange in this context and looks like it was added by a different editor who is not happy that this is mentioned. It is used to cast doubt on what are known to be facts but rather than delete the entry I will give the editor a chance to back up that statement with facts.

Snappy, why are you removing &quot;[[Ulster]]&quot; from the description of [[Ulster Protestant]] people? [[User:Gob Lofa|Gob Lofa]] ([[User talk:Gob Lofa|talk]]) 20:27, 22 March 2015 (UTC)
:Well going by Snappy's edit summary in his last revert, because the source doesn't state &quot;Ulster&quot;, which is correct. However the source is a Northern Ireland Life &amp; Times survey, which sampling was specifically of Northern Irish people. This is an article on Unionism in Ireland as in the whole island not a select part of it. Thus I think the source may only be referring to the actual sentence it is appended to, i.e. ''&quot;However, these are generalisations, because there are both [[Protestant nationalist]]s and [[Catholic unionist]]s,&quot;'', which the source backs up and there is no issue with.
:The sentence that you are altering which before your edit is ''&quot;Most, but not all, unionists are of one of various [[Protestant]] backgrounds. Nationalists are mostly of a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] background.&quot;'' I am assuming that this is actually unsourced, and whilst a source would be ideal, we can easily call [[WP:SKYISBLUE|blue]] on this. 
:Your suggested change &quot;Most unionists are [[Ulster Protestants]], and nationalists are mostly [[Irish Catholic]].&quot;, cuts down on the words and is also easily [[WP:SKYISBLUE|blue]]. Yet do we need to change what is there? If so then we could simply find a source for the sentence or lump a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag at the end of an obviously true statement.

::The problem with Gob Lofas change, it that it is unreferenced. A consistent problem with him, is that he readily adds unreferneced material and then gets really annoyed when someone calls him out on it and removes it. Are reliable references available for this? If so, why haven't they been provided? Adding an &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cn}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag is a silly suggestion, and beneath you Mabuska. If the statement is &quot;obviously true&quot;, it should be simple to get a few reliable references. [[User:Snappy|Snappy]] ([[User talk:Snappy|talk]]) 20:56, 26 March 2015 (UTC)
:::My view would be that the [[Ulster Protestant]] and [[Irish Catholic]] articles are more relevant than linking to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Protestant]] articles. While the reference doesn't explicitly give those adjectives, given the context it's obvious that the Catholics being referred to are Irish and the Protestants are from Ulster. Do you doubt this, Snappy? Far from calling me out on anything, you have a strange aversion to the term 'Ulster Protestant' plain to anyone who looks at the edit history and talk page of that article, unlike your more limited activity on the Irish Catholic page. What is the basis of this aversion? [[User:Gob Lofa|Gob Lofa]] ([[User talk:Gob Lofa|talk]]) 21:30, 26 March 2015 (UTC)
::::On Billy Fox's talk page, where the debate is over a year old, you gave a reference (at last!). This appears to state the so-called &quot;Ulster Protestants&quot; are a group in the Ulster counties in the Republic of Ireland, separate from Irish Protestants in the Republic, and from Northern Ireland Protestants. Yet here you are claiming that ''all'' Protestants in Ulster are members of this group. Such inconsistencies reek of OR. Also remember that essays are not Wikipedia policies or guidelines.

:::::That's a little misrepresentative. It divides Irish Protestants into Ulster and non-Ulster, and further divides Ulster Protestants by the border.

{{od}}I think we've gone a bit off what the original issue here is, and I think I have found the obvious solution that was always on Wiki. Snappy opposes Gob Lofa's wish to link Protestant and Catholic to [[Irish Catholic]] and [[Ulster Protestants]]. I can understand the opposition to it, however there are two '''better''' wikilinks we can use that shouldn't be any trouble: [[Protestantism in Ireland]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland]]. Surely that is the most common sense solution that makes more sense than just linking to Protestant and Catholic and makes more sense than just linking to Ulster Protestant and Irish Catholic? [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:08, 30 April 2015 (UTC)

::::To quote you from above: ''&quot;My view would be that the Ulster Protestant and Irish Catholic articles are more relevant than linking to the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant articles.&quot;'' Well the two I suggested are more relevant and avoid issues of needing sourced as we are linking to the relevant religion on island articles. Your suggested articles in comparison and more misleading and easter egg. Your Jew comparison is neither here or there. [User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:03, 1 May 2015 (UTC)
:::::Why do you believe they're more relevant? [[User:Gob Lofa|Gob Lofa]] ([[User talk:Gob Lofa|talk]]) 19:47, 1 May 2015 (UTC)
::::::Because your case came across as stating that the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] links are far too general as they reflect the entire branch of their respective denomination across the world. Your case came across as looking for more Ireland specific religion articles. Unfortunately the two you wish to add into the article, which whilst in the general scope of where most unionists come from is correct and [[WP:BLUE]], in reality doesn't take into account the Protestants outside of Ulster (which do exist) that are of unionist belief. Also not all Irish Catholics can be classified as nationalist. At the time of [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]]s death (an Irish Catholic by the way), was he a nationalist? No he was a unionist. Also not all Catholics of a nationalist persuasion may be of Irish identity. So I agree now wholeheartedly with Snappy that your suggestions are troublesome. The two links I suggested however deal with the issue by specifically linking to the Catholic and Protestant in relation to the island of Ireland articles, which solves your issue without the problems. Thus [[Catholicism in Ireland]] and [[Protestantism in Ireland]] are the only sensible links we can go for. [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:27, 1 May 2015 (UTC)
:::::::In return for answering your question, answer mine... how are the two links I'm suggesting misleading? They both refer to the two denominations on the island without the added baggage of identity (Irish) or regionalism (Ulster), so cover both denominations across the ''whole'' island which this article deals with (in regards to unionism). The Republic does supposedly have 500,000 British passport holders, more than the entire population of the 3 Ulster counties in the Republic. Obviously they can't be called unionists without explicit evidence stating so, and I wouldn't suggest that they are, however it does show that we can't simply regionalise the religion and politics. It is more grey than we know. [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:14, 2 May 2015 (UTC)
