[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Hello, and thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia. I noticed that you recently added commentary to the Henry Hopkins Sibley article. While Wikipedia welcomes editors' opinions on an article and how it could be changed, these comments are more appropriate for the article's accompanying [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]. If you post your comments there, other [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|editors]] working on the same article will notice and respond to them, and your comments will not disrupt the flow of the article. Thank you! [[User:DemocraticLuntz|DemocraticLuntz]] ([[User talk:DemocraticLuntz|talk]]) 01:16, 23 December 2013 (UTC)
