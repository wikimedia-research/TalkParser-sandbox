==Reason not to speedy==
I have been working with the original creator on this article so COI prevents me from declining the speedy myself. I don't believe this qualifies for G4 as it is not substantially identical to the version deleted at AFD (I should know I've deleted a few versions in the interim!). If someone really thinks it should be deleted then I would suggest that a new AFD is now in order. Cheers, [[User:Nancy|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Segoe Script;color:#FF6600;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;Nancy&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Nancy|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Segoe Script;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt; talk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 18:28, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

==Please cross-check== 
I request administrators not to blindly delete this article, as this article is requested by many users, and all fans of Miss Pooja really want to see her here. This was deleted previously as, at that time references were mostly from blogs and forums. Now the article is in prefect order. Does not make sense now to delete this article.

== Revisions restored ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJ.delanoy&amp;diff=263647681&amp;oldid=263585326 Per discussion] with the admin that deleted the last &quot;proper&quot; version of the article, those revisions have been restored as it is no longer ''substantially identical'' to the article deleted at AFD.
