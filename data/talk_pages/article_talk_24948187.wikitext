I don't know what's going on with this other guy, but he starts revert wars regularly, I looked at his talk page.  I thought my edit reasons were pretty obvious, but to clarify, this [[User:Megata_Sanshiro|Megata Sanshiro]] reverted my edit, claiming it was an old trivia reference to a character's blog and it is neither old trivia and this blog he mentions is nowhere to be seen.  I improved wording to add more detail and even added a reference and he just reverted my edit again.  Looking at the dispute resolution page, this seems to stick out: &quot;Assume that an editor is acting in good faith until it's absolutely clear that they're not.&quot;  When his editing reason doesn't make any kind of logical sense, it's pretty easy to assume, especially based on his talk page, that his revert wars are never in good faith.  I just added a bit to the bottom of his talk page, just to try, but it's most likely a shot in the dark as he hasn't responded to half of those complaints.--[[User:TigerNightmare|TigerNightmare]] ([[User talk:TigerNightmare#top|talk]]) 11:21, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
