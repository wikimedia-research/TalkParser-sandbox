== Stereochemistry not defined ==

Is this compound a racemate [50% (R)-stereoisomer + 50% (S)-stereoisomer] or the pure (R)-stereoisomer or the pure (S)-stereoisomer? Stereoisomers regulary have a different pharmacology and different pharmacokinetics [E. J. Ariëns: Stereochemistry, a basis for sophisticated nonsense in pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology, European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 26 (1984) 663-668]. --[[User:Jü|Jü]] ([[User talk:Jü|talk]]) 20:31, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
