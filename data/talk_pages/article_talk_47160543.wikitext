== Welcome! ==

Hello, Jack1016, and [[Project:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia!  I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[SimScale]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may not be retained. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:Teahouse|Teahouse]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{tl|help me}}''' on this page, followed by your question, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:SimScale]]==
[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:SimScale]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:SimScale|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;[[User:JJMC89|JJMC89]]&amp;thinsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:JJMC89|T]]&lt;b&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;/b&gt;[[Special:EmailUser/JJMC89|E]]&lt;b&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;/b&gt;[[Special:Contributions/JJMC89|C]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:38, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
== Speedy deletion nomination of SimScale ==

Hello Jack1016,

I wanted to let you know that I just tagged [[:SimScale]] for deletion, because it seems to be inappropriate for a variety of reasons.

If you feel that the article shouldn't be deleted and want more time to work on it, you can &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:SimScale&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+page+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+ contest this deletion]'''&lt;/span&gt;, but please don't remove the speedy deletion tag from the top.

You can leave a note on [[User talk:Kudpung|my talk page]] if you have questions. [[User:Kudpung|Kudpung กุดผึ้ง]] ([[User talk:Kudpung|talk]]) 13:04, 6 July 2015 (UTC)

== Managing a conflict of interest ==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, Jack1016. We [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome]] your contributions to Wikipedia, but if you have an external relationship with some of the people, places or things [[Special:Contributions/Jack1016|you have written about]] on Wikipedia, you may have a [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]] or close connection to the subject.

All editors are required to comply with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] content policy. People who are very close to a subject often have a distorted view of it, which may cause them to inadvertently edit in ways that make the article either too flattering or too disparaging. People with a close connection to a subject are not absolutely prohibited from editing about that subject, but they need to be especially careful about ensuring their edits are verified by [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] and writing with as little bias as possible.

If you are very close to a subject, here are some ways you can reduce the risk of problems:

*'''Avoid or exercise great caution when editing or creating''' articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with.
*'''Avoid linking''' to the Wikipedia article or website of your organization in other articles (see [[Wikipedia:Spam]]).
*'''Exercise great caution''' so that you do not accidentally breach Wikipedia's content policies.

Please familiarize yourself with relevant content policies and guidelines, especially those pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability of information]], and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiographies]]. Note that Wikipedia's [[wmf:Terms of Use|terms of use]] '''require disclosure''' of your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation.

For information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]]. Thank you.{{#if:|&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00CA00&quot;&gt;FreeRangeFrog&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:11, 6 July 2015 (UTC)}}&lt;!-- THE FOLLOWING CATEGORY SHOULD BE REMOVED WHEN THE USER IS BLOCKED, OR IT IS DECIDED THAT THIS USER DOES NOT HAVE A COI, OR THIS TEMPLATE HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE WITH NO ACTION. --&gt;[[Category:User talk pages with conflict of interest notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:uw-coi --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00CA00&quot;&gt;FreeRangeFrog&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:11, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
