== RfC closure review: [[Talk:Kosovo#Request for comment]] ==

I have started a [[Wikipedia:Closure review|closure review]] for [[Talk:Kosovo#Request for comment]]. The RfC was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKosovo&amp;diff=674740882&amp;oldid=674721576 closed] by {{user|Kingsindian}} on 5 August 2015 in response to [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Requests for closure/Archive 18#RfC Kosovo Identification|an WP:ANRFC request]]. The close was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKosovo&amp;diff=675040253&amp;oldid=675040021 hidden as a contested close] by {{user|Red Slash}}. There is discussion about the closure at [[Talk:Kosovo#Post RfC]].

There is a re-closure request [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators'_noticeboard%2FRequests_for_closure&amp;diff=675040706&amp;oldid=675025295 here] at [[WP:ANRFC]], where Red Slash wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Administrators, is there any chance one of you could close this? A non-admin stepped into a really complicated RfC and kind of made a mess of closing it, and we '''really''' could use a full-on administrative close. Thank you.&lt;/blockquote&gt; But per the RfC at [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Archive 12#Review]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the question of whether an RFC close by a non-admin can be summarily overturned by an admin, in most cases, no, and never if the only reason is that the closer was not an admin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Kingsindian put a lot of thought into his close. His close should not be summarily overturned by an admin. Therefore, I am taking the close here for review by the community.&lt;p&gt;[[User:Cunard|Cunard]] ([[User talk:Cunard|talk]]) 05:03, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

: Here is my version of events.
{{hat|reason=A short account of the sockpuppet matters.}}
There was some disruption by a sock in the RfC comments. {{u|Robert McClenon}} suggested on [[WP:ANRFC]] that the closure be handled by an admin because of the sock disruption. However, by the time I got around to closing, the sock had been blocked and its comments struck out. I asked Robert on his [[User_talk:Robert_McClenon#RfC_at_Kosovo|talk page]] as to his judgment about whether this needs an admin close, and he said that since the sock has been eliminated he does not see any obvious need, and told me to use my judgment. So I closed the RfC.
{{hab}}
: According to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kosovo&amp;diff=675040961&amp;oldid=675040253 comments] on the talk page, Red Slash thinks that my closure is vague and that it is a &quot;supervote&quot;. I am not sure what he means by this. I explained my reasoning in detail, and my closure is unambiguous: consensus against option &quot;#1&quot; and consensus for option &quot;#2 and #3&quot;, which I even [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kosovo&amp;diff=674997526&amp;oldid=674986728 clarified] on the talk page. It is not a &quot;supervote&quot; in any form: I just assessed the consensus of a complicated discussion by looking at the arguments for all options, and determined that &quot;#2 and #3&quot; is the best (or the least bad).
: As to the point about non-admin closure, my feeling is that Red Slash in not acquainted with policy here (especially since he asked for re-closure at [[WP:ANRFC]] instead of starting a closure review, as I advised on the talk page). As I explained to him before, there is nothing special in being an admin; any uninvolved editor can close RfCs, provided they explain themselves thoroughly. Please see [[WP:ANRFC]] (point 3).

::: {{re|AlbinoFerret}} I am not sure exactly what you mean, perhaps my last paragraph in the RfC close is not as unambiguous as I think it is. I definitely found that the consensus is against option #1. For the rest of the options, option &quot;#2 and #3&quot; came the closest, and in my judgement, was close enough to be considered consensus. I clarified this on the talk page [[Talk:Kosovo#Post_RfC|here]].

:If I may be allowed to comment here, firstly - no disrespect to admins - but just as trained judges are not &quot;superhumans&quot;, persons with admin status are not somehow better qualified to cast judgement than any third party uninvolved editors. I cannot help but think that the editor to request admin closure is using this track as a sneaky &quot;appeal&quot; because he personally disagrees with the decision of Kingsindian. Seeing the closing statement by Kingsindian, I see all the hallmarks of a good judge who read every comment and weighed through them to arrive at his rational conclusion. If he became an admin tomorrow I doubt he will have suddenly acquired new observation methods, we are all human beings. --[[User:Edin Balgarin|Edin Balgarin]] ([[User talk:Edin Balgarin|talk]]) 22:52, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

For example see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Persian_people&amp;diff=678135275&amp;oldid=678105750 this diff]. It will be very helpful if some admins remove those edit summaries.

== Alan Kurdy related articles ==

We now have three articles, somehow related to the recent (a week ago) death of Alan Kurdy. All of them have been nominated for deletion: [[Alan Kurdi]] (with a redirect [[Death of Alan Kurdi]]), [[Photographs of Alan Kurdi]], and [[NilÃ¼fer Demir]]. There are three independent AfD discussions, and also a number of merge discussions, since some of the articles were proposed to be merged. I voted in two of the AfDs, and I will certainly not be an admin summarizing the discussions. However, I think it would be beneficial if these discussions were summarized by one person, since the most possible outcome (as it looks now) would be merge and redirect, and different discussions have very different ideas on what should be merged where. Any ideas how it could be helped? To be clear, I am not soliciting the opinions on the notability of the articles (which should be left in the corresponding AfD discussions), I am asking for the suggestions how these independent discussions could be closed in the most efficient way, taking into account all opinions. Thanks.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 14:19, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
*One suggestion would be to implement any consensus with no out-of-article effect (i.e any plain &quot;keep&quot;, &quot;no consensus&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; decisions) and if consensus is to &quot;merge&quot; or &quot;redirect&quot; to have a centralized discussion on how to implement it.[[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions]]) 18:56, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
*I'd suggest closing the AfD for [[NilÃ¼fer Demir]] first, then [[Photographs of Alan Kurdi]], and finally [[Alan Kurdi]]. The general chain of thought process among those supporting a merge appears to be in that order for a merge, and a final destination of [[Death of Alan Kurdi]]. I'm making no claim that this is the consensus, but if the results are merges, that is the order that makes sense. ~ &lt;b&gt;[[User:BU Rob13|Rob]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:26, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
* My superficial reading is that the boy's article should be kept and renamed (I am considering both the AfD and the merge discussions) to &quot;Death of ...&quot;, considering that the consensus seems to be that it merits an article but more over the death than the victim. The photographies article is murkier; probably more of a consensus to merge but the direction is an issue. MilÃ¼fer needs more input for now. This is assuming that current trends don't change. [[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions]]) 21:41, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
* I've gone ahead and merged the merge discussions with the AfD discussions:
** [[Talk:Alan Kurdi#Proposed merge with Photos of Aylan Kurdi's corpse]]
** [[Talk:Alan Kurdi#Proposed merge to Photographs of Alan Kurdi]]
** [[Talk:Photographs of Alan Kurdi#Merge NilÃ¼fer Demir to here]]
* Hopefully this should reduce the fragmentation of the discussions a little bit. I am wondering whether it would be a good idea to close [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alan Kurdi]] as &lt;s&gt;speedy&lt;/s&gt; a [[WP:SNOW]] keep, and then defer the question of whether to move the page to the move discussion at [[Talk:Alan Kurdi#Requested move 4 September 2015]]. This depends on whether the discussion qualifies for &lt;s&gt;speedy keep&lt;/s&gt; [[WP:SNOW]], though, which I'm not sure it does. â '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif&quot;&gt;Mr.&amp;nbsp;Stradivarius&lt;/span&gt;]]''''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|âª&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;âª]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:07, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

::*{{U|Ymblanter}}, it's by accident that I see this. Yes, the boy's article is closed, and I closed the photograph-article as &quot;merge&quot;, which I think is properly seen as &quot;merge back&quot;. That was a very unwise split-off from the main article. The photographer, there was no way to close that (early); we'll just have to let it run its course. There's some support for deletion, some support for keeping; much will depend on what the news cycle produces in the next few days.

Per [[WP:CLOSECHALLENGE]] I'd like a closure review on [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2015 May 25#1st to 5th century BC births]]:
# Trying to sort it out with the closer, to no avail: [[User talk:MER-C#Problem with closure of Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2015 May 25#1st to 5th century BC births]] 
# Prior to that I had attempted to stop the bot implementing the closure, but the bot already had completed the task [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Armbrust&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=675309237]

Problem with the CfD as closed: overrides [[WP:COPDEF]] and [[WP:SEPARATE]] by adding categories like [[:Category:15 BC]] to biographical articles. I'm OK with merging BC &quot;birth by year&quot; categories in BC &quot;birth by decade&quot; categories, and recategorizing the affected biographical articles along these lines, not with the &quot;dual upmerge&quot; of &quot;birth by year&quot; categories in biographical articles to both a &quot;birth by decade&quot; ''and'' a &quot;by year&quot; category (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanicus&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=675255267&amp;oldid=673993759]) while this is undesirable overcategorization (&quot;birth by date&quot; categories are covered by [[WP:COPDEF]], &quot;by year&quot; categories are not), and makes the BC by year categories mixed people/non-people categories (not allowed by [[WP:SEPARATE]]).

I started removing &quot;by year&quot; categories ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanicus&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=675255267 diff]), which is uncontroversial per [[WP:COP]], but there are too many and any cooperation of bot operators seems to be impossible as long as there's no apparent consensus this is indeed what should be done. Also [[Wikipedia:Bot policy#Categorization of people]] proved to be ineffective in this case (see [[Wikipedia talk:Bots/Requests for approval#ArmbrustBot 4]])

{{ping|Marcocapelle}} pinging initiator of the CfD to know their view whether they were aware about the COPDEF/SEPARATE issues when submitting the CfD, and if not, whether it would have made any difference when being aware?

# {{u|Marcocapelle}} or whoever thinks this a good idea are of course at liberty to resubmit a similar CfD that keeps within the provisions of [[WP:COP]].

I'd agree with a simple removal of &quot;year&quot; categories on biographical articles by bot, but as this may lead to other issues, I think it best to fully retract our steps to the situation &quot;ante&quot;, and take it from there. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 09:42, 12 August 2015 (UTC)

**Nah, [[WP:CfD]] does not stand for &quot;Categories for deletion&quot;, it stands for &quot;Categories for discussion&quot;, so, per [[WP:CLOSECHALLENGE]] &quot;Challenging other closures&quot; applies for which this is the right venue. {{ping|Armbrust}} please stop wikilawyering, the consensus is clear. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 05:25, 17 August 2015 (UTC)
***Doesn't matter, whether the D stands for deletion or not. CFD is part of the [[WP:XFD|deletion process]], and is therefore reviewed at [[WP:DRV]]. Also please don't close this discussion in violation of [[WP:INVOLVED]] again.

****Which part of &quot;please stop wikilawyering&quot; was unclear? E.g., [[WP:INVOLVED]] is about admins, I'm not. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 04:59, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
****Updated the closure, inviting a closer look from '''uninvolved''' users only. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 05:01, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
*****You keep to close this as an involved editor, and then say that &quot;a closer look from '''uninvolved''' users only&quot;. That's boardering on hypocrisy. You can request uninvolved closure at [[WP:ANRFC]].

******Again: which part of &quot;please stop wikilawyering&quot; was unclear? E.g., shouldn't be listed at [[WP:ANRFC]], doesn't meet its criteria. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 05:46, 20 August 2015 (UTC)
*******Again: which part of &quot;don't close this while being &quot;involved&quot; in the discussion was unclear.&quot; [[WP:ANRFC]] doesn't have any such criteria.

********[[WP:ANRFC]]'s criteria: &quot;Formal closure by an uninvolved editor or administrator should be requested where consensus remains unclear, where the issue is a contentious one, or where there are wiki-wide implications&quot;
********#&quot;...consensus remains unclear...&quot; â consensus is clear
********#&quot;...issue is a contentious one...&quot; â nobody thinks application of [[WP:COP]] to be contentious in this case
********#&quot;...wiki-wide implications...&quot; â well-defined limited set of articles, standard application of guidance: no wiki-wide implication
*******:There is no rule that an involved party can't assess a clear consensus, close accordingly, and not burden ANRFC with such a trivial matter. So please stop wikilawyering: all procedural arguments against an uncontentious assessment of a clear consensus are clearly off-topic, no more than [[WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY|artificial red tape]] far from the ground of the matter (a series of categorizations not allowed by [[WP:COP]] on which everyone agrees it is applicable guidance here). --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 08:17, 21 August 2015 (UTC)
********No, the consensus isn't clear in this discussion at all. Nobody really agrees with your proposal in the forward section.

*********If an ''uninvolved'' editor thinks so, they can assess my closure.

*I'm going to say '''support''' MER-C's original close (as it was summing up the consensus). If another category needs deleting, this can be done separately (Personally, I say empty the &quot;by decade&quot; category, and change it to a parent cat of the &quot;by year&quot; ones, but that's just my 2 cents). This is probably dealt with best with a new CfD, not by overturning a perfectly valid close of a discussion from the views expressed. The close is valid with the arguments provided there.

I can't leave a msg on the [[User:Skamecrazy123]] talk page. Some of the recent reverts being done by the editor are wrong and are unexplained. [[Special:Contributions/203.173.186.163|203.173.186.163]] ([[User talk:203.173.186.163|talk]]) 19:43, 12 September 2015 (UTC)

:::Why didn't you explain that in the edit summary, instead of wasting my time dragging me here? It didn't look like you were cleaning it up at all, hence the revert. --[[User:Skamecrazy123|Skamecrazy123]] ([[User talk:Skamecrazy123|talk]]) 19:51, 12 September 2015 (UTC)

::::I explained one of my reasons in a hidden comment in the edit (which you should have noticed), and the rest of it should have been obvious. To say it is wasting your time is a spurious argument. I could say that you are wasting my time.  Also, the quality of your edits had to be raised.  If I saw two problematic edits in such a short space of time in=t calls into question all of you other edits.
