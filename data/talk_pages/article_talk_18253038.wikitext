== Your RfA ==

I saw it, and it's pretty unformatted. I hope you meant a second nomination for yourself, instead of [[User:Wikipedian2 2]].[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] [[User talk:Jasper Deng|(talk)]] 04:06, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
:Reply on your own talk page please. I'm sorry, but I don't think you're ready yet, given your daily activity here. See [[WP:NOTNOW]].[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] [[User talk:Jasper Deng|(talk)]] 04:11, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
:OK, thank-you for considering anyway. [[User:Wikipedian2|Wikipedian2]] ([[User talk:Wikipedian2#top|talk]]) 04:12, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
:::I did notice your Rfa as well and began some preliminary checks that will occur, and I respect your ambition, but honesty fell I should alert you to the [[WP:NOTNOW|policy regarding early attempts]] which are not quite ready to be compared to expected criteria. Again, I respect ambition, but an administrator is expected to be well in tune with policy and consensus. The simple act of moving forward without full preparation and credential, will be a negative consideration, and there is not enough motivation and ambition to overcome that fact. Please consider this and believe me I am trying to tell you a thing you can almost expect, if you do go forward. Even the malformed RfA, will be used to demonstrate that now is not the right time for you to attempt this thing. IMHO.

== Your recent RfA ==

I am sorry, but I have closed [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Wikipedian2 2|your Request for adminship]] prematurely. Simply put, you only have 441 edits on Wikipedia; while your edit count isn't the only determining factor, and numerous people have their own personal standards by which they judge RfA candidates, [[WP:NOTNOW|this particular RfA was all but assured of not passing]].

I am sorry about this, and I hope you don't take it personally. If you continue to contribute to the project in a positive fashion, I am confident that you would be able to submit a successful RfA in the future. You may wish to consider applying for [[Wikipedia:Editor review|an evaluation by other Wikipedia editors]] for feedback on how to obtain the necessary experience. Once you are ready to request adminship again, there is a great [[Wikipedia:Admin coaching|admin coaching]] program available, as well as a [[Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship|guide to requests for adminship]].

If you have any other questions about becoming an administrator, please don't hesitate to ask me. Good luck!

Hello. I noticed that you tagged this for speedy deletion per db-notenglish. Please note that speedy deletion of non-English articles is only for such pages that have an equivalent on a foreign-language Wíkipedia, not for completely new entries. That is also why a speedy deletion request must have the corresponding interwiki article listed. If you find a page that's not been written in English and can't be sure that there's a similar article on another language Wikipedia, please tag it with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Not English|&lt;language&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and list it at [[WP:PNT]]. If the page then has still not been translated after two weeks it will be proposed for deletion anyway. Regards, [[User:De728631|De728631]] ([[User talk:De728631|talk]]) 15:26, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

== Reviewer granted ==

[[File:Wikipedia Reviewer.svg|right|130px]]
Hello. Your account has been granted the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;reviewer&lt;tt&gt;&quot; userright, allowing you to [[WP:RVW|review other users' edits]] on certain flagged pages. [[WP:PC|Pending changes]], also known as flagged revisions, underwent a [[WP:PC|two-month trial]] which ended on 15 August 2010. Its continued use is still [[Wikipedia:Pending changes/Request for Comment February 2011|being discussed by the community]], you are free to participate in such discussions. Many articles still have pending changes protection applied, however, and the ability to review pending changes continues to be of use.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not [[WP:autoconfirmed|autoconfirmed]] to articles placed under level 1 pending changes and edits made by non-reviewers to level 2 pending changes protected articles (usually high traffic articles). Pending changes was applied to only [[Special:StablePages|a small number of articles]], similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at [[Special:OldReviewedPages]].

For the guideline on reviewing, see [[Wikipedia:Reviewing]]. Being granted reviewer rights doesn't grant you status nor change how you can edit articles even with pending changes. The general help page on pending changes can be found [[Help:Pending changes|here]], and the general policy for the trial can be found [[Wikipedia:Pending changes|here]].

If you do not want this user right, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.&lt;!-- Template:Reviewer granted --&gt; [[User:Dabomb87|Dabomb87]] ([[User talk:Dabomb87|talk]]) 21:43, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

==CSD tagging==
Hi, Wikipedian2. Thanks for the patrolling possible vandal edits. I just wanted to remind you to check an article's history before tagging for speedy deletion. As in the case of [[Swagger]], the article was a vandalized disambiguation page -- so I reverted it. Also, even in its vandalized form, it wasn't gibberish and therefore didn't qualify for [[WP:G1]]. You may wish to review our [[WP:CD|speedy deletion criteria]] when tagging. Cheers. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: tahoma;&quot;&gt; — [[User:CactusWriter|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;Cactus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC5500&quot;&gt;Writer &lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:CactusWriter|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 01:25, 9 April 2011 (UTC)

I'm not &quot;attacking&quot; anything or anyone, just tried to remove obvious fake article (For ex: It says in the article: &quot;Voimis on vocals&quot;. Voimis is an admin at ManowarFinland.com and has nothing to do with any vocals, for crying out loud!) 

Sorry I don't speak engish very much and didn't read the rules, as I see you have your own system to delete pages. I won't touch the page anymore.

== Timothy Everest/GA1 ==


Thank you for taking the time to [[Talk:Timothy Everest/GA1|review]] [[Timothy Everest]] for [[WP:GA]]. I would like to discuss a couple of points arising from it. I appreciate it is highly unlikely that I will be able to persuade you of the article's [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]]. Nevertheless, I would point out that it is a fair reflection of the sources. I assure you that had I discovered any reliable sources stating anything negative about Everest, it would have been included (if notable). I refer you to [[WP:V]] “The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth: whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been [[WP:SOURCES|published by a reliable source]], not whether editors think it is true.“&lt;br&gt;Re: Stability – you note: “The article has been recently recommended for deletion by an editor.” and you failed the article on this criteria. The “Stable” criterium is: “it does not change significantly from day to day because of an ongoing edit war or content dispute”. Two drive-by tags added by an IP do not constitute an edit war. Please re-assess this section.&lt;br&gt;Re: Overall Assessment – you note: “as it has been recently recommended for deletion under [[WP:PEACOCK]], I cannot say the article is very stable.” The 'editor' was an IP who did not recommended for deletion under WP:PEACOCK, but under [[WP:NOTABILITY]]. As was noted on the TalkPage, the “list of references and independent sources at the bottom of the article establishes the subject's notability beyond the shadow of a doubt.” Please amend your review to reflect this.

Hi Wikipedian2. I have closed your RfA to prevent a pile-on. Running 12 days after a previous run is generally not a good idea.

== GAN reviews ==

Hi, with regards to your reviews, I am pleased that you are using a template to help you with the reviews, but you do need to examine each point. 
*[[Talk:History of the horse in Britain/GA1]] A one line review, eight minutes, that failed to address any of the [[WP:WIAGA|criteria]]
*[[Talk:Timothy Everest/GA1]]. Nine minute review and instant failure. You used a template, but failed to check any but one criterion.  That one you got wrong.  The notability tag was placed by an IP and subsequent discussion on the talk page determined its removal. You could have put the article on hold to allow discussion with the nominator. I renominated this article with the original ttimestamp so that another reviewer can undertake a full review.
*[[Talk:Legacy of Leonid Brezhnev/GA2]] You used the template and passed it in 18 minutes despite expressing concern about neutrality.
I really don't think that you have grasped reviewing and am asking you to seek a mentor at [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Mentors]] before undertaking any more reviews. Please read and understand [[Wikipedia:Reviewing good articles]]. You also need to need to fully understand the policies and guidelines governing each criterion. We all make mistakes, but I am afraid that yours are far too frequent. Thank you. [[User:Jezhotwells|Jezhotwells]] ([[User talk:Jezhotwells|talk]]) 12:50, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

== Systematic Removal of Links to One Site ==

I found that you help answer user questions/concerns and was wondering if you could help.  I see that a Wikipedia user, has set out to sytematically remove Wikipedia's links to our site.  He/She has created a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:The_Anome/wisegeek_links working list].

We started our site in 2003.  Since then, an extremely diverse set of Wikipedia contributors (who are unaffiliated with our site) used our articles as a source for hundreds of Wikipedia articles.   We're huge fans of Wikipedia and we think it's an immensely valuable resource.  In fact, we were (and are) very happy to have been able to help (in our own very small way) to Wikipedia's continual rise.  As you can imagine, it is distressing to have the attributions removed.

I know that most Wikipedians work for the greater good, but I question whether that's the driving force in this instance.  It seems suboptimal for one Wikipedian to systematically go through and undo the work of hundreds of Wikipedia editors.

I would really appreciate some advice about how to proceed.  Thank you.

== Moving  Nathaniel Currie into the mainspace ==

re creating Nathaniel_Currie_(Ontario_politician) for me.
Thanks very much for move Wikipedian2. I was aware that I could simply create the article myself and I guess that would have been the best way to do it, if I'd known about the backlog at the time. That said, these were my thoughts when I did it that way:
* I wanted some feedback on the (Ontario Politician) suffix for future disamb purposes. Does this conform to Wikipedia standards? If I create the article myself, is there a way to get comments on this?
* I was hoping to find out how to get a review, without getting into peer review, which this article is not ready for. I'm still fairly new to the Wiki process and am more interested in a good article than anything else.
Thanks again for the effort.
[[User:CJ3370|CJ_WeißSchäfer ]] ([[User talk:CJ3370|talk]]) 12:26, 18 April 2011 (UTC)

:Hi CJ3370, Thank-you for your time in creating a new article, this is appreciated. Due to the backlog (which you have already identified) - full feedback and review on [[WP:AFC]] was probably slightly optimistic. Though I am more than willing to answer your questions; the suffix appears to me to meet the purposes of disambiguation, and is actually encouraged in biographical articles where there may be people of a similar name. I personally would of excluded the &quot;Ontario&quot; part as it seemed unnecessary, but causes no harm. 
I see no reason why you cannot ask for peer review, but if you are uncomfortable with your article being peer reviewed, you could look at who are the regular reviewers, and politely ask one of them on their talk-page. I would help you, but I don't feel qualified enough to give a detailed review. 
Feel free to ask any other questions.

== Hugh Culverhouse Review ==

Thanks for taking the time to review my [[Hugh Culverhouse]] GAN. I see that you failed it for not including any images. The criteria says that it contains images, &quot;if possible&quot;. I did spend too many hours trying to track down a public-domain image, but it turns out that he was a rather private personality, and there are no photographs available apart from those that are the property of newspapers. A website gave me permission to use a photograph of him, but I was made to remove it, as there was no evidence that the website had permission to use it. You can suggest image sources, but trust me, I've tried them all. If that's the sticking point that keeps this from GA status, than this can never be a GA. I was under the impression that images were good to have but were not required. What's the definition of &quot;if possible&quot; in the critieria?

Thanks again [[User:Dementia13|Dementia13]] ([[User talk:Dementia13|talk]]) 22:38, 20 April 2011 (UTC)
:Agreed, this failure was incorrect. I shall re-list this with the original timestamp.

::If you was given permission, then email the evidence to the email team. I'm guessing it was probably in the form of an email by the newspaper - so do it!

== RfA Reform update ==

Hi. It's been a little while since the last message on RfA reform, and there's been a fair amount of slow but steady [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Progress|progress]]. However, there is currently a flurry of activity due to some conversations on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;oldid=447112737 Jimbo's talk page]. 

I think we're very close to putting an idea or two forward before the community and there are at least two newer ones in the pipeline. So if you have a moment: 
*Have a look at [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Minimum requirement|the min requirement proposal]] and  familiarise yourself with the statistics, I'd appreciate comment on [[Wikipedia talk:RfA reform 2011/Minimum requirement#What should the bar be?|where we should put the bar]].
*Any final comments would be appreciated on the [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Clerks|clerks]] proposal.
*Feedback on the two newer proposals - [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Radical alternatives/Pre-RfA Proposal|Pre-RfA]]  &amp; [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Sysop on request]]. Both are more radical reforms of RfA and might run along side the current system. 

Thanks for reading and for any comments that you've now made.

== News and progress from RfA reform 2011 ==

{{collapsetop|bg=#33FFCC|RfA reform: ...and what you can do now.}}
&lt;small&gt;(You are receiving this message because you are either a task force member, or you have contributed to recent discussions on any of [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Pages|'''these pages''']].)&lt;/small&gt;

'''The number of nominations''' continues to nosedive seriously, according  to  [[User:WereSpielChequers/RFA by month|'''these monthly figures''']]. We know why this is, and  if the trend continues our reserve of active admins will soon be underwater. Wikipedia now needs suitable editors to come forward. This can only be achieved either through [[WP:RFA2011|changes]] to the current system, a [[WP:RFA/RADICAL|radical alternative]], or by [[Wikimedia Foundation|fiat from elsewhere]].

'''A lot of work''' is constantly being done behind the scenes by the coordinators and task force members, such as monitoring  the talk pages, discussing new ideas, organising  the project  pages, researching  statistics and keeping  them  up  to  date. You'll also  see for example that  we have recently  made tables to  compare how other Wikipedias choose  their sysops, and some tools have been developed to more closely examine !voters' habits. 

'''The purpose of [[WP:RFA2011]]''' is to  focus attention on  ''specific'' issues of our  admin  selection  process and to develop  RfC proposals for solutions to improve them.  For this, we have organised the project into [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Pages|''dedicated sections'']] each with their own discussion pages. It is important to  understand that  all Wikipedia policy changes take a long  time to implement whether or not the discussions appear to  be active - getting the proposals right ''before'' offering them for discussion by the broader community is crucial to the success of any RfC.  Consider keeping the pages and their talk pages on your [[WP:Watchlist|watchlist]]; ''do'' check out older threads before starting a new one on topics that have been discussed already, and if you start a new thread, ''please''  revisit it regularly to follow up on new comments.

'''The object  of [[WP:RFA2011]]''' is ''not''  to make it  either  easier or harder to  become an admin -  those criteria are set by  those who  !vote at  each  RfA. By  providing  a unique venue for developing ideas for  change independent  of  the general discussion  at  [[WT:RFA]], the project has two  clearly  defined goals: 
#Improving  the environment  that  surrounds RfA in  order to  encourage mature, experienced editors of the right  calibre to  come forward, pass the interview, and dedicate some of their  time to  admin  tasks.
#Discouraging, in  the nicest  way  possible of course, those whose RfA will be obvious NOTNOW or SNOW, and to  guide them towards the advice pages.
The fastest way is through improvement to the current system. Workspace is however also available within  the project  pages to  suggest  and discuss ideas that are [[Wikipedia:RfA reform 2011/Radical alternatives|not  strictly  within  the remit  of this project]]. Users are invited to  make use of these pages where they  will  offer maximum exposure to  the broader community, rather than individual  projects in  [[WP:user space|user space]].

[[WT:RFA|'''We already know what's wrong with RfA''']] - let's not clutter the project with perennial chat. RFA2011 ''is now ready'' to propose some of the elements of reform, and all the task force needs to do now is to pre-draft those proposals in the project's workspace, agree on the wording, and then offer them for central discussion where the ''entire'' Wikipedia community will be more than welcome to  express their opinions in  order to  build consensus.

'''New tool''' Check your RfA !voting history! Since the editors' RfA !vote counter at X!-Tools has been down for a long while, we now have a new [http://toolserver.org/~snottywong/rfastats.html RfA  Vote Counter] to replace it. A significant improvement on the former tool, it provides a  a complete breakdown of an editor's RfA votes, together with an analysis of the participant's voting pattern. 

'''Are you ready to help?''' Although the main engine of RFA2011 is its task force, ''constructive'' comments from  any  editors are always welcome on  the project's various talk  pages. The main  reasons  why  [[WT:RfA]] was never successful in  getting  anything  done are that threads on different aspects of RfA are all mixed together, and are then archived where nobody  remembers them and where they  are hard to  find - the same is true of ad hoc threads on  [[User talk:Jimbo Wales|the founder's talk  page]].
