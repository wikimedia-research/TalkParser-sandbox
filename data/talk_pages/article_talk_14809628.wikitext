== Fixing title ==

A few comments:
1) This needs to be NPOVized somewhat.
2) Typically, we don't put &quot;the&quot; in article titles unless there's some good reason to do so. I would prefer to see this at [[Bear community]] or some such.

Absent discussion, I will effect these changes myself. [[user:Montrealais|Montrealais]]

== ''The bear community was created...'' ==

''The bear community was created...'' &lt;- seems to imply a group of people sat down and said &quot;hey! let's do the show right here in the barn&quot; (or whatever... you get the idea). Don't communities in general come about gradually, rather than &quot;created&quot;? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

:The term &quot;created&quot; does not imply it happened instantaniously. Example: &quot;He created a masterpiece in his painting &quot;The Dancing Pinapple Head Lady,&quot; which took nearly twenty years to complete.&quot;

== definitions ==

I question the definitions given for &quot;muscle bear&quot; and &quot;muscle bear cub.&quot;  If a man is lean, the bears of my acquaintance don't refer to him as a bear or bear cub, &quot;muscle&quot; or otherwise.  If they deign to speak of him at all, they may call him an otter.  Whenever I hear the term &quot;muscle bear&quot; or &quot;muscle cub&quot; (not &quot;muscle bear cub&quot;), the person being described is muscular but stocky.

*Two terms I'm used to that do not appear: '''wolf''', similar in meaning to ''otter'' (which I'd never heard) but connoting sexual aggressiveness, and '''furry''', a generic adjective for a bears, cubs or wolves. ''Furry'' might be British, but I've heard it often in the States (and Google yields abundant hits). Comments? I'm reluctant to just add them without some input. [[User:Unsinkable|Unsinkable]] 01:09, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:I agree that these terms should be added, with one caveat.  As I understand it, both the bear community and [[furry fandom]] use the word &quot;furry,&quot; but with different meanings.  I believe that any listing of &quot;furry&quot; should make that clear. [[User:Doctor Whom|Doctor Whom]] 28 June 2005 14:40 (UTC)
Perhaps this (I'd rather get some consensus prior to posting on the page):
*Wolf (under ''otter'' in the list): same general physical traits as ''otter'', but connoting sexual aggressiveness.
*Furry (at the end of the list): general adjective for bears, cubs, wolves and otters. For other uses, see the disambiguation page ''[[Furry]]''.

: You seem to have some confusion as to what &quot;POV&quot; means here at wikipedia. Almost ANYTHING could be determined to be someone's point of view. I could say that Madonna is a singer; you may feel that her primary function has been as an actrress, and thus we both have a point of view, but to state in her article that she is a singer and actress would be factual an appropriate to include. Additionally no one would ask for sources about these statements because they are considered common knowledge. However, common knowledge only extends as far as the minds of those who have an active interest in knowing about any given subject.

: That being said, everything that I've stated in the above section that you keep removing is common knowledge fact to those in the bear community, and anyone denying them would be delusional. For instance, the statement about the depictions of an ideal bear could easily be verified by looking at the cover models of the past 100 issues of &quot;American Bear&quot; magazine. The phrasing of my entry is particularly important in establishing it's NPOV status: &quot;it has been derided BY SOME,&quot; for instance...it leaves it very clear that this is the observation of SOME, but not of ALL.

: I will do my best to find sources that reference these statements, but continued deletion of them on your part without providing a reason beyond your assertion that they are POV, '''WHICH IS INCORRECT''', will mean that we may have to escalate to a third party opinion.

I do think, however, that the language used was POV and unnecessarily inflammatory especially considering that no sources were provided.

I know that women aren't *welcomed* at the bear bar I go to, but they aren't actively excluded that I have seen. In an environment where a bunch of gay men are looking to talk to or hook up with other gay men, women (gay or not) are going to end up on the periphery. --[[User:Syrthiss|Syrthiss]] 14:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== Woof (not in a good way) regarding External Links ==

In my opinion, the external links are getting too long. I don't think this article will ever be developed enough to be a FA, but there are still wikipedia guidelines regarding [[WP:EL|external links]] that I would like to adhere to. I propose pruning it a lot, but want to see what other editors think before I do it. --[[User:Syrthiss|Syrthiss]] 13:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)	* I've removed most of the links.

*Your commercial link is not acceptable. The other links are not commercial and they are clearly relevant to the article. Inserting your link to increase the page rank in Google is considered link spamming. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spam#External_link_spamming]. Also, please [[WP:CIVIL | try to be more polite in the future]]. Thanks. --[[User:Thickslab|thickslab]] 03:19, 30 July 2006 (UTC)


I added the Taormino column to the external links and rearranged them chronologically. Should all the linked articles and periodicals be grouped together another way?

== Racism, Sexism and Bears ==

I have been a bear most of my life and I have been to many bear events.  I have not once seen anything that even closely resembles racism (as there are many mixed couples present), Sexism (as I know of many women that frequent these events) or elitism (as the bear community is more on the acceptance on one's own image over that of the stereotype).  

It should be noted that as the gay community progresses and ages, the long held stereotypes are no longer valid.  To say that we do not welcome those that are effeminate, is to say that we don't accept ourselves. Much an oxymoron.

While it is true that most bears tend to be attracted to those of a similar stature, there are quite a number that are looking for quite the opposite.  And, still, there are some &quot;bears&quot; that are hetrosexual, chosing to celebrate all that is being a male.

         Um, no not really. I see many bears these days attracted  to non bears and yes even some twinks and vice versa. I have even see more non bears accpted in bear runs and bear bars these days. This should definetely be noted.


A bear, it should be noted, is more the attitude of acceptance our own flaws as being part of who we are, rather than trying to live up to an image.

:I would slightly disagree. It is not an attitude of accepting our own &quot;flaws&quot; as a rejection of the meme that anything other than a lean, hairless body is a flaw. Big, big difference.[[User:TechBear|TechBear]] 19:07, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

The Bear &quot;community&quot; is very accepting of Bisexual and Transgendered people, and this is very surprising since Bisexuals and Trans people get ignored, or told that they don't exist by the mainstream GLBT/gay &quot;community&quot;.

However, there is a lot of racism within the bear community, you can't deny it. It's sort of a white supremacy within &quot;SOME' sections of the community but not all.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/64.203.237.142|64.203.237.142]] ([[User talk:64.203.237.142|talk]]) 17:24, 4 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Wombat, manatee, etc. ==

Can someone provide some sources for some of the more ridiculous animal words, i.e. wombat, manatee, fluffy, koala bear? And also for the alternate definition of &quot;panda bear?&quot; These are not words I have ever heard used in this context. -- by thickslab, originally unsigned.

I disagree with the culling of the description list to 'keep it short and simple'. Nor was it admirable to remove terms that are relevant to geographically specific areas, such as 'wombats' and 'koala bears'. Aside from the recent rise in muscle bear exclusivity, I had thought the bear culture welcomed diverse opinions. And to pre-emptively respond to the criticism that opinion has no place on wikipedia, it is collective opinion and action that eventually morph into the solid fact demanded from any encyclopaedia.
* Some of these phrases were redundant - &quot;muscle bear&quot; and &quot;muscle cub&quot; and &quot;pipe bear&quot; have obvious meanings and clutter up the list. Others such as koala bear and wombat seem to be made up or not widely used and I couldn't find references to them in a google search. I posted the above comment and never heard an objection, so I went ahead and trimmed the list of some redundant and silly definitions. --[[User:Thickslab|thickslab]] 14:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Bears in history ==

On the topic of bears in history, I admit that it seems a little spurious, but to refer to it as ridiculous is to overstep the bounds of language. It is important to recognise that while some personalities in history were not called 'bears' (or ursus) in their day, the basis of hirsute, masculine men engaging in homosexual activity is a pertinent point of reference for community origins. -- anonymous comment by IP 
* The bears in history section contained unsourced speculation and what seems to me to be [[WP:OR|original research]. (And I doubt that most people would call Antinous a cub, based on the depictions we have of him, anyway.) --[[User:Thickslab|thickslab]] 14:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Lies ==

&quot;The bear community originated in San Francisco in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the leather and &quot;girth and mirth&quot; communities. It was created by men who felt that mainstream gay culture was unwelcoming to men who did not fit a particular bodily norm (hairless, and young).&quot;

Complete bullshit. Obviously bearish gay men exist all over the world before the 1970. The only thing the US did was coming up with the community idea, making it famous and commercialising it.

As stated somewhere below I would also change the &quot;was created&quot; sentence. [[User:Guest Account|Guest Account]] 08:52, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
*This is the popular account of how it was created, and I agree that it's probably more of a fantasy than truth. Unfortunately I don't know of any references that tell a different story. Does anyone have anything we can add that can shed light on this? --[[User:Thickslab|thickslab]] 13:27, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

I remember the first Bear event took place at the Pilsner Bar in San Francisco in 1988?  1989?  It was reported in the B.A.R., I think.  It was actually more of a tongue-in-cheek thing, kind of a spoof of drag shows and leather events.  The Pilsner back then had a more blue collar, out of the mainstream crowd--certainly not what would be considered Bearish today. That's the first time I heard the word Bear used to describe gay men. --[[User:Paddbear|Paddbear]] 19:57, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

isnt the bear run part of this article a bit ameri-centric? theres the very popular great british bear bash and several events through europe especially in spain.... i would argue that to be an inclusive article, the bear runs should mention other non-US held popular bear runs

== Trans inclusive ==

I don't think there's a huge amount of women in the bear community but there sure is a decent trans presence. I'm a bit overloaded at the moment but it would be nice to find ways to acknowledge this at some point. [[User talk:Benjiboi|Benjiboi]] 01:46, 18 November 2007 (UTC)


Women in the bear community?  Bears are for male role models -- ones that are not the traditional male twink scope.

The trivia and pop culture sections are interesting but a bit useless as is and, to me, the entire article should be re-structured and use those examples of how bear cultures have become more mainstream.

==Slang and links==
I don't agree with the word gay slang as a synonym for the Bear community. Last version didn't had the word gay slang when I searched wikipedia for Bear community .It is an identity Bear community is proud of. Many people in the bear community like to idenitfy as a bear ,cub ,chaser , muscle bear. Also the article misses the explanation of cubs, otters , daddy bear ,muscle bear , woof which I though there was in the previous edit.

===Rename (thus focusing a bit more) ===
Per above &quot;It might also make sense to make a conscious decision to either be inclusive to all bear communities (which I think would be difficult) or rename and re-aim the lede to state there is a growing emergence of bear cultures within the LGBT movements which is mostly gay men. Rename suggestion --&gt; Bear cultures (gay), or something similar unless the article is going to try to accurately discuss most of the bear communities around the world which I don't recommend.&quot;
Does '''''Bear culture (gay)''''' make sense for this article? If not any suggestions? Also I should clarify I meant that it's mostly gay men in the bear cultures not in the LGBT movements. [[User talk:Benjiboi|Benjiboi]] 22:54, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I would think '''''Bear (gay)''''' would be correct. The word expresses not just a distinct community and culture, but a distinct identity as well. I would rather see the term itself be the subject of the article rather than some aspect of it. And '''THANK YOU''' for your work, Benjiboi; you have done a bang-up job on GLBT articles and your efforts are much appreciated. [[User:TechBear|TechBear]] ([[User talk:TechBear|talk]]) 23:07, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

:Much appreciated TechBear! It's stressed me out a lot so I only do a little each time. Per the title then I wonder if '''''Bear (gay slang)''''' then is most appropriate to keep in line with similar articles of gay slang? [[User talk:Benjiboi|Benjiboi]] 00:02, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:: I would push against the '''''(gay slang)''''' label. While the word &quot;bear&quot; is used as slang to mean someone who is older/hairier/fatter than the current archetype of gay male beauty, it also represents a distinct sub-set in a way that &quot;twink&quot; and similar slang words do not. As I said above, &quot;bear&quot; is an identity, a community and a sub-culture.  While a comparison can be made between the [[circuit party]] circuit and the bear event circuit, I have yet to see anything along the lines of an International Twink Rendezvous. ;-b [[User:TechBear|TechBear]] ([[User talk:TechBear|talk]]) 00:19, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't think it should be '''''Bear (gay)''''' or '''''Bear (gay slang)'''''. If you just do the first, you're leaving out others within the '''community''' such as chasers, otters, etc. which will in turn call for their own articles and face deletion, etc. And as a bear, I'm offended by ''gay slang''. Being a bear or loving bears is an identity, not a nickname or latest cool gay slang like [[Santorum (sexual neologism)|santorum]] :P Seriously, I really like '''''Bear culture (gay)''''' - if it just really, absolutely has to have a name change because I don't see anything wrong with its current name except maybe it should be '''''Bear community (gay)''''' instead of just '''''Bear community'''''. -- [[User:Allstarecho|&lt;strong style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#DC143C;border:1px solid #000&quot;&gt;ALLSTAR&lt;/strong&gt;]][[User talk:Allstarecho|&lt;strong style=&quot;color:#FFF;background:#0F4D92;border:1px solid #000&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;echo&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]] 00:44, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::::Disagree. The modifier ''gay'' is to address that the articles focus is on bear culture within LGBT communities as I'm certain there are other ''bear'' interests out there that are not LGBT. ''[[Slang]]'' simply means that a word is not meant literally and &quot;usage of slang expressions can spread outside their original arenas to become commonly used, such as &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;jive&quot;. Slang can be argot and pejorative which the article can delve into as appropriate. To address the other (totally valid) concerns I say focus on the end game; little old lady hears the word and turns to wikipedia to get an answer what is all the fuss about. I think this article should lede with bear as gay slang with major sections on history of term (an outgrowth in opposition to twink and gym queen cultures intertwined with the AIDS pandemic condition of wasting), bear culture (with further subsections including major events, terminology); modifiers (Black bear, Polar bear, Muscle bear, Panda bear, etc) ; and a subsection just for otters with the potential that it could grow into it's own article (but that's a way off I imagine). I'll also state that I'm a bit of an inclusionist so am slow to delete good content but I see the whole pop culture and &quot;controversy&quot; sections as problematic so reworking the structure might provide some  framework in which that content would make sense to the average reader. [[User talk:Benjiboi|Benjiboi]] 02:38, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::::: You make good points. While I don't much care for the slang label, you have the experience so I will defer. Would it be worth setting up a sandbox for the rewrite, or will the existing article be changed in-place? [[User:TechBear|TechBear]] ([[User talk:TechBear|talk]]) 02:46, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:::::: Well, unless I'm wrong it is slang otherwise it may sound like we are referring to gay bears which is already covered in the homosexuality of animals article. I'm in no rush here so let's make sure '''''Bear (gay slang)''''' is the way to go. My hunch is that it would be the &quot;mother&quot; article with any potential other articles (like community, otter, etc) birthing out of it as it grows too large. If we go with something else (even &quot;otter&quot;) the first part of the article is explaining what a bear is anyway. [[User talk:Benjiboi|Benjiboi]] 08:57, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::::::: I wasn't necessarily referring to &quot;otter vs bear&quot; but rather how defining this article about a single subject, as '''''Bear (gay slang)''''' does, then you'd have to end up creating seperate articles for chasers, otters, ursophile, etc. By leaving '''community''' in the name, you're including just that, the community of which revolves around bear culture. I still prefer '''''Bear community (gay)''''' but you know I have the deepest admiration and respect for you Benji so whatever you feel is necessary, I'll support. -- [[User:Allstarecho|&lt;strong style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#DC143C;border:1px solid #000&quot;&gt;ALLSTAR&lt;/strong&gt;]][[User talk:Allstarecho|&lt;strong style=&quot;color:#FFF;background:#0F4D92;border:1px solid #000&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;echo&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]] 15:52, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Indent reset. Mucho appreciated and back atchya! I see no problem with including the communities content as well as otter et al with a move to '''''Bear (gay slang)''''' and would actually expect to see that in the article. This is who uses this term applies to and why and how and here is the communities, events and naming conventions that are a part of this minority within a minority community.

==&quot;original research&quot;?==
In what sense in the analysis of a concept &quot;original research&quot;? I wrote that stuff. I didn't research it at all. The fact is when you call a man a bear you do it for a reason. It's like a literary allusion. The only way to understand what it means is to understand what it achieves.

Additionally it's important not to dilute the concept such that we are pretending women can be bears, or that transexuals are a significant part of bear culture. if you start doing this, the article reads like a reflection of the author's preoccupations and politics and misleads people.

== Pop Culture ==

For quite a long time there was a section listing the numerous places where 'bear' was mentioned in mainstream and pop culture. The list began growing bigger and bigger as the bear community got more exposure, and ultimately was so big that it began getting smaller again. Now it's gone completely. Though I understand wikipedia is not a place to just dump a list in an article, I do think it bears (ha!) mentioning that this relatively small sub-culture has become part of the general lexicon due to numerous appearances in mainstream culture.
