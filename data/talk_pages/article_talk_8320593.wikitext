== Proposed split ==
This can be confusing, having two people on the same page. Split? [[User:JulieSpaulding|JulieSpaulding]] ([[User talk:JulieSpaulding|talk]]) 07:57, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

I agree, it is confusing. Since John Pinch the elder is more famous, how about creating a new page for John Pinch the younger with a [[Wikipedia:Hatnote|hatnote]] pointing to it? [[User:Spoonfrog|Spoonfrog]] ([[User talk:Spoonfrog|talk]]) 13:13, 1 September 2010 (UTC)

:Split done. &lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SilkTork|&lt;font face=&quot;Script MT&quot; color=&quot;#1111AA&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;SilkTork&lt;/font&gt;]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|&lt;sup&gt;YES!&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:16, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

*Following the split, some help disambiguating the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Pinch incoming links to John Pinch] would be nice. [[User:DuncanHill|DuncanHill]] ([[User talk:DuncanHill|talk]]) 23:37, 13 January 2011 (UTC)
