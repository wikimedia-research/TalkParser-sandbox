===Your edits to [[July 25]]===
Dear [[User:76.70.86.199|76.70.86.199]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px]]
Some of your [{{fullurl:July 25|diff=275310252&amp;oldid=275124131}} edits] on the page 
[[July 25]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: The person you added doesn't seem to have a Wikipedia page.
If the page exists, check that you've spelled and capitalized the name the same way as the article, and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you [[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved. Please see [[User:Pseudomonas/Guidelines on adding births and deaths|this page]] for help. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-PseudoBot2 --&gt; [[User:PseudoBot|PseudoBot]] ([[User talk:PseudoBot|talk]]) 02:25, 6 March 2009 (UTC)
