Providing sections would make the article more readable and get the Wiki and Sections tags removed.  Good luck... [[User:Ttonyb1|ttonyb1]] ([[User talk:Ttonyb1|talk]]) 02:03, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
:I renamed you biography section education since that was really what the content seemed to be.  I also added performances section.  Can you break up this section further?  [[User:Ttonyb1|ttonyb1]] ([[User talk:Ttonyb1|talk]]) 04:09, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for the input.  I wrote on your discussion page as well; when I get back to adding more information to this I will work on breaking up the performances section as suggested.  I have to get back to other stuff!!!  [[User:Bubratsche|Bubratsche]] ([[User talk:Bubratsche|talk]]) 05:22, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
