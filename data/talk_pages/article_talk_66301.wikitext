== Still can’t see any criticism ==

Even if this plane had a number of incidents (crash, canopy stuck etc…), huge development and maintainance costs.

Controversy is well documented.

Hey, will you write anything on thrust vectoring? I don't have much in mind besides &quot;well, the nozzles move&quot; :) and I think it would be an interesting subject if you have some technical explanation. I can make a list of fighters that support it, starting with that first Sukhoi.

== F-22 cost ==

[http://www.aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_aerospacedaily_story.jsp?id=news/mar07024.xml A recent aviationnow article] places the cost at about $91 million. I think there needs to be some note in this wiki article of the nuances of military (particularly air force) equipment procurement costs [[User:Xmnemonic|mnemonic]] 12:33, 2004 Jul 6 (UTC)
:: The figure in that article does not account for R&amp;D costs, which have already been paid for and is not a small amount. -[[User:N328KF|jph]] 14:30, 2004 Jul 6 (UTC)
::: ...which emphasizes my point regarding USAF cost quotes. who's up for a dedicated USAF aircraft procurement cost article?  i think it's a very complex issue deserving of a thorough explanation. [[User:Xmnemonic|mnemonic]] 01:04, 2004 Jul 18 (UTC)

This sentence in the &quot;Procurement&quot; section seems to be missing a subject: ''&quot;In 2005, for the fiscal year 2006, under further DoD cost cutting measures, is forecasting the number of aircraft procured at 180 saving an additional $15 billion but raising the per unit cost.&quot;'' I would have fixed it up if I knew what it was supposed to mean. [[User:Skyring|Pete]] 03:18, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

What i find missing in the debate about costs, is that the Raptor is a prime example of [[iron triangle]] politics. Mentioning this is like blasphemy to some people, but iron triangle politics are everyday business in the pentagon. An excellent book about this, even though somewhat outdated, is &quot;The power game&quot; by Hedrick Smith. It describes the decision process and the resulting skyrocketing costs for a few 80ies weapon systems such as the B-1 and the navy's aegis cruisers. It's still standard procedure in Washington to promise heaven at a bargain to get a weapon program started, and then start to expand (gold-plate) it as much as possible, and make it politically unstoppable in the process by spreading subcontractors neatly over congressional districts. Once a program is on its way, no air force officer can critize it without risking his career. This is precicely what the air force colonel who's mentioned in the external links did. The real value of his critisism lies in it's independence. Don't forget that the Raptor is what it is because of political decisions(or the lack thereoff), so my remarks are not political reflections on technical decisions but rather the other way around.
I recommend that a section about this would be added to the article, as it was a defining factor about the F-22---karelke---

Find a citable source for it and we will. --[[User:Mmx1|Mmx1]] 03:53, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

The current Unit cost in 2006 for the F-22A is at $120.088 million per aircraft, as shown on page 65 of this document --&gt; https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/FMB/pb/2007/afprocurement/3010_Aircraft_Procurement_v1_FY07_PB.pdf

== F/A-22 vs F-22 ==

http://www.airforcetimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1409158.php
The USAF dropped the A designator from the F-22.  Its officaly the F-22A, being F-22 model A.

== Stealth System ==

The stealth system on the F/A-22 is pretty simple. What it does it absorb radio waves and act as an antenna to a radio. It is covered with a substance (most likely graphite and epxoy) that absorb them. Those that are not absorbed are put into random directions by saw like edges that are very small. It acts as a radio antenna by catching radio waves and altering there direction. This also explains the w shape of the B-2 Spirit bomber. Another thing it does is that its two rudders are tilted so that when radio waves hit them the ones that arent absorbed are sent to the other wing just like a satellite focuser. The F/A-22 also has its bottum wings bent ever so slightly so it can do this and keep aerodynamics. It also probably has about 4-8 Radio jammers on its bottum to keep people that see it from reporting it... or so it can kill them before they do
But dont think the F/A-22 is invincible because its far from. Ive already discovered and developed a radar system that can show an F/A-22, a F-117, and a B-2 bomber at there full size. it works with a frequency that can not be altered by an antenna actualy this frequency is in the catogory of microwaves and burned a hole in my wall when i first tested it. Plus i developed a pistol that would shut down any plane with an E.M.P and then magnetize a steel projectile that is flung at the craft, it is magnetized to a certain degree where it will &quot;seek&quot; a fighters engine and go down the shaft. When i tested this I made a mini without a projectile and it shut down my computer for about a week and erased all my info, luckily i had a paper copy of the stuff. Another side effect of the E.M.P is that it infected my computer with a virus, which was not fun when it finally turned back on.
I've figured out a lot more than this but if I told the FBI and the Air Force would be pretty mad. So dont think ive told you everything and go do something like try to shoot an F/A-22 down cause I wouldnt give that info out on the internet unless I was paid to.

:Your observations are interesting, but Wikipedia is not the place to publish your original research.  See [[Wikipedia:No original research]].  Good luck with your experimentation.--[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 00:46, 31 August 2005 (UTC)


They are unconventional exhausts - they obscure the view of the turbine blades which are exposed in most aircraft (including the F-35), which are perpendicular to the X-Y axis and a huge RCS factor. Moreover, just because you don't see metal doesn't mean it isn't there. The only difference between the gray and shiny parts are the RCS paint (which I'm assuming isn't heat-resistant enough). It's still oriented so that you won't get a significant return off of it except directly from the top or underside. --[[User:Mmx1|Mmx1]] 03:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

:::What I don't get is how an EM pulse would put a virus on a computer. Surely that's like getting cancer from a gunshot wound? I think someone might be telling porkie pies.

i like that &quot;cancer from a gunshot wound&quot; comment...that's pretty good. but yeah, dan apparently has no idea what he's talking about. 4-8 radio jammers? that essentially negates the whole stealth design. as for the emp, it's not a directional weapon. and how do you magnetize a piece of metal to &quot;seek&quot; a certain piece of an aircraft? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] 20:42, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

its actualy very simple. Take binary code oioioioioioioiioioioioioioioioiioiiioiioooiiooi this is a fragment of binary code. It is controlled by magnetism. however if there is a program saved and an emp hits the it will rupture the binary code. thusfore making norton think its a virus. But if norton gets ruptured pending on where its ruptured then it can go haywire. thusfore creating Terminator 3 like program that kills everything. The computer was an e-machine and generaly a piece of crap.

:Yeah it was becoming slightly believable until he said a week long virus that survived after having his programing completly wiped from shooting an EMP pulse at his computer. [[User:Drew1369|Drew1369]] 15:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)


It already had viruses because it was a crap computer and realy slow so it just may have survived from th EMP but i only have theories on why it had a virus if you could shed light on this i would be much appreciative because i realy have no idea why it had a virus. i know why it erased everything because the hard drive is written using a magnet and it was an electro magnetic pulse but why would it still have a virus wouldn't it erase that to?
Daniel Glisson

I have an idea. I'm going to do this again except this time as a controlled experiment. I will take two crappy computers. One infected with viruses one that does not have viruses. I will put a magnetism detector inbetween them. I will place them 5 yards away from an emp. This time i will use nitroglycerin. This will make the EMP stronger. Then i will see what happens. If you see any flaws in this experiment please tell me before i waste money on it. I will wait 30 Days  before i do this so please tell me before then. the date is 11/8/06 I will video tape this experiment.

Then are you going to misspell more words? [[User:RMelon|RMelon]] 18:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

== Data sources ==

Could somebody please cite sources on the specifications listed here?  A lot of the real data is classified, so it would be good to know what the source of the guesswork/leaks are. [http://www.pogo.org/m/dp/dp-fa22-Riccioni-03082005.pdf this highly critical report (PDF)], by a bloke who was reputedly high-up in the F-16 program, implies that the figures quoted are optimistic in some cases.  --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 23:06, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
:That report is a bit... odd.  The author grasps at straws (or misunderstands the subject) when he says the aircraft's stealth is a failure.  Sonic booms only provide auditory detection clues, not tracking information.  &quot;Netted computers can track its sound&quot; well yes, but to my knowledge no such systems exist, and there'd be a host of interference problems to handle.  With the heat signature, [[IRST]] is still not reliable for ranging information and is all but useless at high aspect angles because the engine plume is obscured.  The visibility of APG-77's LPI emissions is highly debatable, but the F-22 can use datalink and passive RWR tracking (it has been confirmed) for guiding weapons instead (leaving the radar silent).  He brings up the hackneyed &quot;21 B-2's&quot; example, but doesn't mention the debunking; after the unit procurement reduction, Northrop drastically raised the unit cost (as every company does with changing purchase quantities).  He misnames the [[B-52]] as the &quot;Stratobomber,&quot; which damages his &quot;expertise&quot; further.  Then he claims that T/W and wing loading are the only measures of fighter maneuverability, ignoring things like drag (of any type), thrust vectoring, fly-by-wire etc.  He's flat-out wrong when he says the F-15C and the F-22 carry the same weapons.  And he misunderstands [[sensor fusion]] because he fails to realize that the software provides the upgrade-potential and flexibility of the system, not the hardware.

:Anyways, I could go on but the man's just wrong.  Yes, accurate sources are an important part of military equipment analysis.  I've read everything from Jane's (British) to International Air Power Review (American) to official USAF advertised values.  Everything in this article I've read is reasonably accurate, but performance values for ''any'' aircraft are endlessly debatable.  This guy has a bone to pick with the F-22, and he's shaped his entire understanding around that.  He is not a reliable source, because of his &quot;facts&quot; and because of his agenda.  [[User:Xmnemonic|✈ James C.]] 02:33, July 31, 2005 (UTC)
:P.S. And oh my god... he states that the F-22 -&gt; F/A-22 re-designation marked an actual design change of the aircraft.  It seems he confused it with the YF-22 -&gt; F-22 revisions.  This guy is ridiculous.


:Can't we find something more credible than this if we want to cite criticism of the Raptor? -[[User:RedMageCWD|RedMageCWD]] 00:55, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

Can't we find anything better then attacking the credibility of F-22 critics? &quot;this bloke&quot; is a retired air force colonel, but everything he says about the raptor is not credible because he misstates the name of the B-52? If i would want to attack this kind of credibility attacks on F-22 critics, i could also very easily arrive at the conclusion that &quot;anyways, i could go on but the man's just wrong&quot;. 'The man' in this case being the author of the above article. oops i forgot to use caps, does this make my statement invalid?

:* Col. Riccioni was never on the F-22 program (much less &quot;high up&quot; in it); the whole program is antithetical to his philosophy. Riccioni was one of the key players in the &quot;Fighter Mafia&quot; who pressed for an aircraft design approach that resulted in the F-16. He was once respected as someone who &quot;got it&quot; on what fighter design should be, but if this article is any indication, he's &quot;lost it&quot; in a fanatical sense. Even if everything he wrote here were demonstrable fact, I couldn't honestly use this article - a tirade, really - as a reference. Anything with such a high boldfaced-italics-to-plain-text ratio, footnotes that mostly refer to his own work or anonymous &quot;confirmations,&quot; and a tremendous conglomeration of unfootnoted assertions expressed with religious fervor must come across as a screed, not a sober analysis. Nor are his some of his &quot;facts&quot; correct even when they're easily checked without resort to classified data. (E.g., &quot;Yet, curiously, '''''Lockheed sought license to sell the F–22 abroad — and it was granted!'''''&quot; Not only has such a license '''not''' been granted, it is currently against federal law to export it!)  However many of his criticisms may be on target, his presentation seriously detracts from his credibility. [[User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark]] | [[User talk:Askari Mark|Talk]] 04:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

:: The Defense Monitor article makes some of the same criticisms, that adding &quot;stealth technology&quot; created an F-22 with the same flight characteristics as an F-15:  namely, Mach 2.5, 60,000 ceiling, 3,000 mile range, 8 missiles, etc.  The religious debate is whether stealth=BLUE or stealth=BLACK (visual vs radar invisibility).  As far as I can tell, the USAF chose to make the F-22 a &quot;stealth black&quot; prototype (super F-15) over a &quot;stealth blue&quot; UFO-like ultimate dogfighter.  Both are uncharted research territory, but I can see his point that for $70b program costs, we might want to focus on aerodynamics, speed, and maneuverability, rather than radar signature, for a fighter that still relies on ~90% visual kills.   After all, if we had real standoff capability in the air, we wouldn't bother to make fighters in the first place. -broodlinger  [[User:24.184.67.122|24.184.67.122]] 22:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

== Removed section  ==

I removed the section entitled Performance Notes from Simulator Testing in X-Plane 8.21, which had the following content:

:* Using [http://www.x-plane.com X-Plane] 8.21 and Barry's F-22 Aircraft file at http://xplanefreeware.net/barry/index%20F22.html, these things were derived:

:* The F-22 can exceed Mach 2.2 with afterburner.  Mach 1.72 is the accurate with supercruise at 40,000-50,000 feet, but it is more Mach 1.5 at low altitude.

:* The engines definitally are at their most efficient between Mach 1.4 and 1.6 at high altitude.

:* 65,000-70,000 feet can be sustained if ascending carefully and never going below Mach 1.2.  Max altitude subsonic is more 60,000 feet.  I've climbed to over 90,000 feet, but it obviously cannot sustain that altitude.

:* It flies from Miami, FL to Lima, Peru with 25,000 pounds of fuel and no in-flight refueling.  It was done at high altitude (&gt;60,000 feet) at Mach 1.5-1.65 without afterburner.

:* The F-22 can fly, stay on course with a lot of effort, but not take off or land, in X-Plane's worst possible weather conditions - 200 knots, level 9 turbulence, 50 knot and 180 degree wind sheer.

:* Some of this stuff may still be classified, but it was analytically reverse engineered with [http://www.x-plane.com X-Plane] by [http://www.laminarresearch.com/ Laminar Research], which is public and affordable by individuals, but is used as the simulation software in [http://www.flightmotion.com/ Motus] full motion simulators certified to train commercial pilots!  Look in in the Total Flight Immersion Section for the references to Laminar Research.

Personally, I think your experiments sound like reasonable guesswork, but it's definitely original research which is banned by our policy at [[Wikipedia:no original research]].  Sorry.  Research has to be published elsewhere before including it.  In any case, Barry doesn't explain how he came up with his aircraft model; without that information it's not all that useful.  How the hell does he know that the engines actually have the capabilities he's ascribed to them, for instance?  --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 02:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:I agree. :)  [[User:E Pluribus Anthony|E Pluribus Anthony]] 08:33, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
::To me it sounds like he took a flightsim, added the airplane and tested it, but without knowing anything as to how the creator of the plane had decided on the aerodynamics of the plane. For all we know, the addon might be pure guesswork... [[User:Bjelleklang|Bjelleklang]] 14:03, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
:::One of X-Plane's claims to fame (as opposed to, say, Microsoft Flight Simulator) is that the flight dynamics of its aircraft are based on the actual properties of the airframe (aerodynamics, etc).  Sort of a &quot;virtual wind tunnel.&quot;  So with X-Plane, you put the design in the sim and the sim tells you how it should fly, whereas in MSFS or others, you put the plane in the sim and tell the sim how it should fly.  Nevertheless, this is original research and thus not appropriate. -[[User:RedMageCWD|RedMageCWD]] 00:47, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Performance ==

Different Sources show different preformacne.

*Book A = Mach 2.2
*Book B = Mach 1.8
*Source A = Mach 1.8
*Source B = Mach 2.5
*Source C = Mach 2.7

Why is that? Which source is correct? I say that i think the manafacturer preformance is correct. [[User:Irfanfaiz|Irfanfaiz]] 13:17, 29 November 2005 (UTC) 

(Mach 1.8 = too heavy i think)


I spoke with a Raptor test pilot at the Edwards AFB air show a few years ago. He said that he had no trouble breaking Mach 2. However, he would not give me an exact top speed. Also, the Raptor can supercruise at Mach 1.7 at least, per this quote from Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John P. Jumper

“Today I flew the Raptor at speeds exceeding (Mach 1.7) without afterburners,” General Jumper said. “To be able to go that fast without afterburners means that nobody can get you in their sights or get a lock-on. The aircraft’s impressive stealth capability, combined with its super cruise (capability), will give any adversary a very hard time.” (Courtesy of Air Education and Training Command News Service)&quot;

Considering the importance of speed in a modern fighter jet, it's good that the speed of the f22 is discussed in the article, and I believe that discussion can be expanded into it's own section, with a note such as &quot;see above discussion&quot; at the speed listed in the  specifications section. //Azninja

: I think it's unlikely that the F-22's is slower than the F-15 (mach 2.54).  The supercruise engines and large wing surfaces suggest an improvement in speed.  I say &quot;suggest&quot; because our sources appear to be classified. [[User:24.184.67.122|24.184.67.122]] 21:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

== Speed ==

The correct speed is mach 2.2. i know this because i was inside lockheed martin while they where making them. I asked the designer how fast they could go and he said. &quot; The F-22 has an airspeed capability of mach 2.2&quot;

:If you were inside Lockhead Martin while they were developing it then you would know that you just gave out clasified information and could be charged for giving out national secrets that would put you in jail for a very long time. [[User:Drew1369|Drew1369]] 15:58, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

i know a bunch of stuff that was classified because i went with some boy scouts on a trip to lockheed martin. This was before 9/11 i also saw a barrel of chloroflouro something. i know it wasn't chloroflourocarbons.

id be glad to answer questions if you've got them

:Sorry, but we can't use that directly in the article, or anything you learned from such an excursion.  It's annoying because there's not that much information about the new generation fighters that isn't hearsay or rumor, but we really need to stick to verifiable sources.

On another note, I've seen a quote from an F-22 driver saying &quot;Well, it can beat the F-15 in a foot race&quot;  and furthermore &quot;Let me just say this: it's the fastest thing we have flying right now.&quot;  Any help with this?

== Naming of this article ==

The naming of this article is by now too old, as the plane was changed from F-22 to F/A 22 a long while ago. Refer to www.globalsecurity.org (having trouble external linkling that one; copy and paste works just fine) for sourcing, but I do not have the time to trawl through the many articles on the F/A-22 to find the specific one that mentions the change of designation. However, if you want a PDF that refers repeatedly to the F/A 22 then see [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/gao/d03431.pdf] --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 22:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I was admittedly surprised by the change in designation.  Is it, in fact, official?  One of the primary reasons  for the change to F/A was to demonstrate the type's versatility to a skeptical Congress regarding funding constraints (given White House 'largesse') or possible cancellation.
::::Yes: references should be clarified.  And that sentence is mildly odd – I believe it recently achieved initial operational capability (IOC) and such references were probably dumbed down for John Q.

== The criticisms section; who came up with these arguements? ==

Someone deserves to have these arguements utterly destroyed.
*High weight: Thrust to weight is still 1.2:1, an impressive ratio, and it doesn't need to be improved really.
*Low fuel fraction: fuel is used more effectively in aeroplanes capable of supercruise, as they do not need to carry afterburners.
*Poor stealth: In air to air combat the Raptor still has the advantage of low radar detection. Also, visibility is hardly an issue; most air-to-air combat is now carried out beyond visual range.
*Poor strike capability: What? the F-117A's 2000lb bombs have EXACTLY the same penetration as 1 small diameter bomb, and &quot;oh yeah&quot; comes to mind, the F-22A can carry 8 of those.
*Lack of need: the US relies heavily on their Air Force deterrent to maintain shaky peace relations, This is in basic military studies. 
:Radar signature is only one aspect of stealthiness, the F-22 has a pretty large Infrared signature coming out it's tailpipe and a sonic boom that you won't have with the B-2 or F-117
Anyone think differently? --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 20:45, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
:Not me. &quot;Poor stealth&quot; is downright wrong. One F-15 has a 100% radar signature, while the F-22 has a 50% signature (and the YF-23 has/had a 40%). If that is &quot;poor&quot; stealth... [[User:Linuxbeak|Linuxbeak]] (drop me a [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|line]]) 20:49, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
::&quot;Lack of need&quot; is actually a quite valid argument, as the aircraft was designed as a fighter, despite the fact that the last airplane the US lost to an enemy fighter happened in 1991 or thereabouts. So many critics feel that the money would have been better spent on a cheaper aircraft, with more emphasis on the attack role (eg. F-15E, F/A-18E/F). [[User:Bjelleklang|Bjelleklang]]  -  [[User_talk:Bjelleklang|talk]] 21:05, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
:::But the attack role is covered very well by the A-10 (going to be kept in service until 2028) , and the only real valid argument is the cost, which has overrun, admittedly. Regardless of the &quot;Lack of need&quot;, is there anything else to support these other arguments? My point about the deterrent factor still stands, by the way. --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 21:14, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

::::::I agree with the &quot;deterrent factor&quot;, but still; considering the fact that the US has only lost one aircraft in air-air combat over the past 15 years (even without the F-22), some people question the real need for the F-22. It's a fighter after all, and was designed as such (although with air-ground capability), and opponents to the program claim that the F-15 and F-16 can do the job just as good, while the JSF will be an improvement over these at a fraction of the cost when compared to the F-22, which in their words is 'overkill'. Air Forces Monthly discussed various critisism sometime early 2005, and mentioned &quot;lack of need&quot; as well as other arguments, will see if I can find the issue. If so, I'll post the most relevant stuff here. [[User:Bjelleklang|Bjelleklang]]  -  [[User_talk:Bjelleklang|talk]] 21:33, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
:::::::Agreed, it does look like overkill, but the JSF is only supposed to serve as the main fighter for a few years (2009-2012 if I'm not mistaken, but don't quote me on that) after which the F-22 is expected to take over. The USAF doesn't need to create more aircraft, admittedly, but if they stick with current aircraft there is a good chance that they lose their edge, so yes, cost is the issue here, but that is the only thing that really deserves a mention. --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 21:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
::::::::Found the issue (july 2005). According to it, the New York Post (Lt Col Ralph Peters (ret)) have published columns critizicing it, and the same has also Christopher Bolcom of the Congressional Research Service in a follow-up to a congressional testimony. They claim that ''since 1991, the US (all services) has flown 400,000 combat sorties, and lost only one aircraft to another fighter (according to the DoD), this being an F/A-18C during Desert Storm.'' In other words, the existing aircraft can do the job just as good as the F-22 with the same weapons, while at the same time being cheaper, and thus there is no need for an air superiority fighter. As this issue was raised as part of a congressional testimony, I think it's valid, and should be mentioned in the article. Also, as I remember, the F-22 was originally slated to be the successor to the F-15, while the JSF was to be the successor to the F-16, F/A-18 (pre-E model) and the AV-8.

:::::::::It does seem to be a particularly weak argument though, as it fails to take into account the fact that the US is not the only country creating new fighter aircraft. The latest Russian Sukhoi and MiG variants are far more capable than anything the US has yet faced in its recent combat actions, and these (and maybe even the Eurofighter Typhoon too) may very well end up in the hands of countries whom the US might fight some day. It surely does not make sense to believe that one's current fighter aircraft are good enough to meet any future threat merely because they have a near-perfect record against an older generation of aircraft, does it? If the US wishes to maintain its aerial dominance, it must field an aircraft that is better than anything else out there. For that, the F-22 is precisely what is needed. &amp;mdash; ''[[User:Impi|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;Imp&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Impi|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;i&lt;/font&gt;]]'' 00:35, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

These stats are not supposed to be considered very accurate as details have not been released, but this is a remarkably good ratio compared to the F-15C, so this proves the capability of this aircraft and also supports Impis points. &quot;Are antiques practical&quot; is the question that seems to face the USAF now, and the answer is &quot;no&quot;. --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 11:02, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

(Resetting indentation)

For what it's worth, my understanding is that the USAF is also worried about the new generation Russian [[SAM]]s, which a broader range of countries are buying.  They alone may make it much more difficult for current-generation fighters to gain air superiority. --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 22:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

The same applies to the F-22 you can't design a plane that's both stealthy from ground threats as air born ones,that was also the point of the &quot;poor stealth&quot; critisism. Not to mention that IR detection has become far more capable since the start of the F-22 program, diminishing it's stealth capability further.

:Would the Russian SAMs that you are referring to be the ones designed to shoot down stealth planes? I think I read something about Russians reverse engineering the [[F-117A|F-117A Nighthawk]] to upgrade their SAMs, when one was crashed in action. The sheer speed of the F-22 would make it hard to design a missile that could catch it after detection. But SAM's are not used in air to air combat, and the A-10 is staying in service until 2028, so the F-22 is definitely not going to replace it any time soon, and SAMs are not a priority over enemy fighters. And to the unsigned comment, IR detection is still not advanced enough to target over the sorts of ranges that modern fighters are capable of. --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 17:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

::About being more efficent than other aircraft in supersonic flight because of &quot;supercruise&quot;, one thing to keep in mind is TANSTAFL. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. During flight tests when the F-22 was supersonic, even though F-15s had to user afterburner to keep up, both aircraft had similar fuel flow rates. Meaning that they were both burning similar amounts of fuel. The engines in the F-22 are designed to generate a great deal of thrust &quot;dry&quot; (without AB), but the amount of fuel burned per pound of thrust generated is still in line with previous low-bypass turbofans. Supercruise is not a magic bullet. It is just the result of VERY powerful engines.

I've read that while the engines are capable of pushing the aircraft much faster, the flight control system limits the top speed to Mach 1.8. This is because of the heavy use of plastics on the aircraft, and they'd weaken if heated too much. The canopy is also plastic.

I spoke with a Raptor test pilot at the Edwards AFB air show a few years ago. He said that he had no trouble breaking Mach 2. However, he would not give me an exact top speed. Also, the Raptor can supercruise at Mach 1.7 at least, per this quote from Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John P. Jumper

“Today I flew the Raptor at speeds exceeding (Mach 1.7) without afterburners,” General Jumper said. “To be able to go that fast without afterburners means that nobody can get you in their sights or get a lock-on. The aircraft’s impressive stealth capability, combined with its super cruise (capability), will give any adversary a very hard time.” (Courtesy of Air Education and Training Command News Service)&quot;

:: The speed question is of course of the most real interest to the child witin us, and looking over the conversations here and the stats reported some of you have pretty dominant inner children... I've just had a look at the recruitment focused fact sheet section within the &quot;cool stuff&quot; part of the UASF's website (http://www.airforce.com/coolstuff/hangar.php) and they give the following stats for performance: Speed- Mach 1.58 (1.7 with afterburners). I think that is the best source for info of this type, rather than quotes from speculative sources, test pilots, designers, games, hearsay etc. It is a definitive, simple number from one of THE most official sources on the subject. With that in mind, I'll make the change. feel free to change it back, but remember this comes straight from a proper source this time that uses an actual number and not just a &quot;class&quot; like the other UASF fact sheet, (the fact that the numbers are less also makes the whole thing a bit more credible). The G limit is also down to &quot;+7.9&quot;. [[User:Ozoneocean|OzoneO]] 13:45, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

I decided to revert it back, i thought it was vandalisim, sorry. But don't go by what the USAF site says. The first thing you learn about the USAF and it's &quot;stats&quot; is that they always low-ball the statistics on it's aircraft. It's pretty much understood by everyone that the F-22 does far over Mach 2 and closer to mach 2.5 with afterburner in real life, and around mach 1.7 with no afterburner.

though I know little of the subject, I deleted:
 or perhaps inflight refuelling

I must disagree, inflight refueling does not make range meaningless.  THe range of an aircraft is more then just how much fuel it can carry.  Engines require cool down time, airframes require regular maintenance, airframe components are suseptible to extreme wear.  When inflight refueling negates the concept of range, the Air Force makes a huge deal about it.  A prominant example is the B-52, which they claim is limited only by the endurance of the crew.
[[User:Klauth|Klauth]] 01:00, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Inflight refuelling does not make range meaningless, but inflight refuelling cannot accurately measure range. With drop tanks, range has a definite measurement, whereas with inflight refuelling range depends on the cooling systems or versatility of aircraft parts. --[[User:The1exile|The1exile]] 22:43, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Inflight refuelling isn't meaningless at all. During some parts of a mission, inflight refuelling is impossible bacause tankers are very vulnerable, and rarely if ever venture into enemy airspace without total air superiority having been established.
talking about range: here is an exerpt from the wikipedia &quot;supercruise&quot; article:
estimates that use of supercruise for a 100 nautical mile dash as part of a mission would cut the F-22's combat radius from about 600 to about 400 nautical miles.

:My opinion is that any game that isn't an attempt at a serious sim rarely makes the cut for significant addition. My criteria is that the media appearance is either significant to the general public (e.g. Top Gun) or is incisive about the plane, which the sims are. Appeareances as a unit in RTS...no. Appearances in arcade sims I vehemently disagree with. They're a skin of the aircraft on a flight model that is very loosely based on the aircraft itself. I'm particularly fed up with Ace Combat fans inserting &quot;X is featured in Ace Combat 05&quot; for every plane in the game, when there are 72 aircraft in the sim. I'll give the Sega Game a pass due to its age. My reasoning is that a semi-serious sim will give a reader some insight into the plane if they want to go out and play it, so even the non-notable ones are worth a mention; you're not going to get that from a game that lets you load 88 missiles into a Raptor, even if it's one of the hottest PS2 games.  --[[User:Mmx1|Mmx1]] 19:25, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

==External Links==

Unfortunately, this issue seems to have escalated rather nastily during the night, but I'll do my best to calm it down, and take another try at explaining what's occurred in this article.  (This comment is mainly directed at Stang281, but is also meant for other posters above.)

Firstly, I would like to apologise on behalf of myself, Mmx1, and Emt147 for being too rude to you.  You obviously meant no harm by adding the link, and didn't deserve what was said to you.  Before being chastised, you should have been thanked for your interest.

However, I would like to take some time and offer explanations for the actions taken by Deniss, Mmx1, and the comments posted above.  Because Wikipedia is often targeted by ''linkspam'', where people attempt to advertise their personal webpages or boost their Google rank by adding links to Wikipedia, many Wikipedians tend to view additions such as yours with suspicion.  I'm not saying they're right in doing so, nor am I labelling your contributions as linkspam; I'm just explaining how some editors behave.

Also, articles like this one tend to get flooded with trivia, such as every video game it's ever appeared in (see above).  Likewise, it sometimes seems that anyone who has a personal webpage devoted to the F-22 wants a link to their webpage.  Consequently, some Wikipedians&amp;mdash;Mmx1 is an especially notable member of this group&amp;mdash;tend to view such additions sceptically.  Again, I'm not passing judgement, only describing behaviour.

I would also like to take time to note, as I implied above, that Administrators have no authority over content disputes.  We can only exercise our powers to deal with serious breaches of policy or protocol.  Please note, however, that [[WP:3RR|revert warring]] (reverting an article three times in 24 hours) is punishable by a 24 hour block.  Because I am personally involved in this dispute, I will not be taking action against anyone who engages in revert warring, but I will take steps to ensure that such behaviour is dealt with.

Now, as for the matter of the link you added.  I have reviewed your webpage, and unfortunately all of the images I reviewed had no source or copyright information.  Images can '''''never''''' be distributed as 'Fair Use' unless their source and copyright status is adequately described.  Because there is no source information provided, we do not know whether the images are Public Domain (taken by the Air Force) or copyrighted (taken by Lockheed, or possibly by photojournalists).  Because of this uncertainty, we should not include the link to your album.  This would be tantamount to illegally uploading copyrighted images onto Wikipedia itself; we have a responsibility to limit our links to pages that are not potential copyvios, unless we have no other options.

You cite our legal disclaimer as evidence to the contrary.  However, the disclaimer has no standing as content policy.  Rather, as I noted above, it is designed to reduce Wikimedia's chances of getting sued&amp;mdash;nothing more.  The fact that we ''claim'' to be free of legal responsibility does not excuse us from being choosy about our external links.

Any of your images that are in the Public Domain can be uploaded to [[commons:Main Page|the Wikimedia Commons]].  Please follow these very important rules, however:
#Images '''''must''''' be in the Public Domain, or available under a free licence such as the [[GFDL]] or CC-by-SA.  Images in the Commons may not be Fair Use images, or images used with permission if said permission does not include third-party use.

== Advanced Tactical Fighter ==

I find it odd that [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] redirects to this article, yet barely makes any mention of the contract fly-off. Ironically, the Wiki article for the ''other'' plane in the ATF competition (YF-23) contains more pertinent information on the fly-off.
: Problem solved. Someone formed a new article.

== MTOW ==

Where did the 80,000 lb MTOW come from? Green's Great Book of Fighters (2001) gives a 55,000 lb MTOW. The 2.7-fold increase from empty weight to MTWO is better than what the C-5 Galaxy can muster.

== Current edit war ==

I'm not sure if you guys are looking at this talk page, but I noticed you guys are edit warring over the following passage:

:''Maneuverability in real-world combat is hotly debated, with some experts claiming it is inferior to the Typhoon. It is not known whether USAF claims about Raptor's superior maneuverability are accurate; many argue that, in any case, today’s beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles make maneuverability less important.''

I've noticed no attempts at discussion from either side.  On T800m101's part, I assume that that may be because you are new to Wikipedia (if so, welcome).  On the other hand, Mmx1 has accused T800m101 of vandalism off the bat, which I consider highly inappropriate.  Mmx1, I encourage you to reread [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]].  ''Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia.''  Do you honestly think that T800m101 is deliberately trying to make the article worse, or do you think it's more likely that he disagrees with the content of the paragraph?  If he is removing it because he disagrees, then you have no right to accuse him of vandalism.  He may just not know the proper procedure of discussing changes.  [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|Please do not bite the newcomers.]]

Now, on to the content in question.  Mmx1, do you have a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]] for that information?  Even if you have a source, I seriously doubt it could be reliable information; I'm certain that the details of the F-22's maneuverability are highly classified and anyone making such claims is engaging in a lot of speculation and guesswork. [[User:TomTheHand|TomTheHand]] 21:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

:My accusations are based on his behavior at [[4th generation jet fighter]], where the user has blanked an entire section repeatedly - blanking qualifies as vandalism. If you look at the history, an IP([[User:68.39.163.15]] was removing the content in a similar fashion shortly before, and the deletion was repeated several times before I made any accusations of vandalism. The deletions here have not been as severe, and I have never accused them of being vandalism.

I still would call it a content dispute rather than vandalism, though a content dispute without communication is probably just as bad.  The content he's removing from 4th gen fighter is sourced, so I can't agree with its removal and without communication from T800m101 I can't really imagine his reasons.  I've left a message on his talk page asking him to talk a bit, but since he hasn't responded to anything before I don't know how hopeful to be.

[[User:Xmnemonic|mnemonic]] 12:21, 2004 Jul 6 (UTC)

The official web site of [http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=199 US Air Force] says that empty weight of F-22 is 40,000-pound class (approximately 18,000 kilograms) and not 31,670 lb (14,365 kg) as claimed in wiki article.
* Key word there is 'class'.  Meaning it weighs 40,000 lb or less.  Similar thing with the Mach 2 class speed.  The weights calculations are shown using sourced data in the '''F-22A Raptor Specifications'''. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 00:11, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

Actualy this has just been tested using microwaves. I made a box thing and was confirmed that the substance is in fact epoxy and graphite. I put down two radios in a box with sheet lead on the outside and sheet lead between them. That way they can,t communicate. Then I made a box that I had equiped with the tech.

:Given the burden on Israeli defense spending ''before'' the current conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, it seems unlikely that Israel would be in the market for such an expensive air superiority fighter as the F-22, even using the generous military aid normally made available to the country by the USA.

==Comparable aircraft==

I don't think there should be a comparable aircraft section at the bottom of the article. The reason for this is there is '''nothing''' comparable to the F-22 flying today anywhere in the world- it truly is unique- nothing comes close to the combat performance of the F-22.--[[User:Indian50|Indian50]] 23:28, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:Eurofighter has proven to be effective against F-22, especially since F22 costs twice as much.
::Source and citation? &quot;Proven&quot; how?  What, a mock engagement between an F-22 and a Typhoon?  No such head-to-head has been made last I knew.  I call shenannigans.  [[User:Thorprime|Thorprime]] 19:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

Comprable aircraft? Maybe not.  Ones the F-22 has to take seriously...definantly.  The F-22 is not a panacea, and it is not just the technology of an aircraft that determines victory in battle.  The F-22 may indeed be the greatest advance in fighter technology since the jet engine, but that doesn't mean that there is nothing else out there capable of competing on its level.  No one knows how something performs until it goes into battle.  Keep in mind the Air Force originally did not want the A-10, and expected it to take massive lossess.  They were wrong.  Meanwhile in Vietnam they thought the F-4 Phantom II would be unstoppable, they were wrong.  

As far as comprable
The F-22 is not the same kind of aircraft as the other next generation fighter.  Notice the trend toward delta wings and forward canards appearing on most next generation aircraft but not the F-22.  This layout is very much to improve dogfighting ability.  But the F-22 is not meant to be a dofighter, it is designed to slip in fire its missiles, and leave without being detected.  Only dogfighting with AIM-9's when necessary.

[[User:Klauth|Klauth]] 05:08, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:Comparing those aircrafts directly, in my humble opinion is ridiculous. They are designed with different points of parameter. Lets point out at russian fighter which primarily concern of manuveurability while F-22 primarily concern on stealthiness. The main thing that they share is only they are fighters, and they are comparable by this main thing. I thing we should keep that section and fill it with same generation fighters.

:There aren't any comparable aircraft, period.  Not the Eurofighter, not anything.  They aren't even in the same class.  Nothing can detect a F-22, or even come close to outmaneuvering it.

::No comparable aircraft?  *Everything* with two engines from 1975 onward is comparable. Range, ceiling, thrust, and payload are all comparable to 1970's designs.  The advantages of the F-22 seem to be top speed (I'm betting mach 2.7) and stealth, which is only effective during the opening moves of a dogfight.  Thirty years and $130m can buy you a lot, but in this case, all it really bought was stealth.  -broodlinger [[User:24.184.67.122|24.184.67.122]] 21:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:::When we say comparable, we mean similar in capabilities (wow).  So no, not everything since 1975 is comparable, nothing is.  Furthermore, you say the F-22 only has speed as its advantage, which is rediculous (and classified).  How about the extremely advanced radar system, the thrust vectoring allowing it to make 9.5g turns, and stealth that is a lot more effective than &quot;only in the opening moves of a dogfight.&quot;  Last time I checked, radar didn't pick up bumblebees, which just incidentally has a bigger radar cross section than the F-22.

=== You may even compare apples and oranges ===

Well guys... here's my (a little ironic, sorry, couldn't resist, because I'm an &quot;old european&quot;) comment: &quot;two fighter aircraft take of from their base, meet and fight each other&quot; is no realistic scenario. Fighters never come without support of AWACS (radar planes), satellites, ships, and / or ground support.

Stealth design and coating is not like a Star-Trek cloaking device. There is weather radar around, which can even track small clouds (so it eventually can also track F22 exhaust, unless the F22 exhaust also is stealth exhaust - just kidding!), and passive radar systems, which can detect stealth aircraft by detecting the disorder in electromagnetical background radiation caused by cellular phone systems, radio, satellites (GPS, TV, communication), radar etc., which is caused by the fact that stealth planes refract/absorb radiation. Of cause this requires a coupled network of &quot;passive radar&quot; stations, but as the stations do not emit any radiation, you cannot spot them (just in case there are people around who'd like to say &quot;then the F22 flies around and takes out all those passive radar stations which it's super-high-range missiles before without being spotted! Hah!&quot;).

There are satellites overseeing the planet which can spot heat dissipation in real time and photograph a newspaper in your front lawn... and it's not only the US which actually has systems like that.

So any technically capable nation in the world can very probably detect an F22 in it's own airspace unless you destroy the whole communication infrastructure of that nation and/or the whole planet first.

Once the F22 is detected, there are missiles which can track it optically and/or by it's heat signature, as an F22 neither is optically invisible nor flies without creating heat.

The soviets shot down a B2, the serbs shot down an F117A (with a russian missile), so I really don't think an F22 is invincible. It's both naive and supercilious to believe that.

You can compare any aircraft to any other if you define criteria and measures (like, for example, &quot;which aircraft can crush more meters of reinforced concrete by crashing into it at top speed&quot;). You can compare packages of aircraft/engines/radar/missiles etc. in defined situations.

But it doesn't lead anywhere, as 1) there always are upgrades available for anything, so a modified version of fighter plane X maybe superior to plane Y in situation Z, and 2), you may not be able to influence the scenario in which the fighter aircraft is needed if it happens to come up.

You may have recognized that the actual revision of the (probably initially assumed uncomparably superior by some) M1 Abrams is the M1A2 (upgraded twice), and the AH64 Apache already is built in it's fourth / fifth revision. Please answer the question: Why that?

The answer is: The other guys do not actually sleep or something, so if the F22 will ever become engaged in an actual battle against the air force of any competitor in aircraft design, I'd not bet too much on the F22's uncomparable superiority.

^ The soviets never shot down a B2. [[User:TwinTurboZ|TwinTurboZ]] 04:47, 13 May 2007 (UTC)

^ I presume he mispoke and meant the Soviets shot down a U2.  If the Soviets had shot down a B2, it would have been during WW3 which, as I'm still sitting here and alive, has not happened. [[User:MazNJ|MazNJ]] 08:57, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

So of course there are comparable aircrafts.
--[[User:83.171.150.187|83.171.150.187]] 21:57, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

The entire section (comparisons) looks like it's an add for lockheed or Boeing.
I seems that the main &quot;sources&quot; to the section  are one excercise and three quotes by three  people of whom two can hardly be described as &quot;Neutral&quot; and the other is a 2004 quote by an air marshall speaking of the future.
An air exercise  in which  aircrafts simulated other aircrafts in a simulated situation, simply says nothing about the F22 in comparison to other aircrafts. 
  
Nobody here has any hardcore  knowledge about how the aerodynamical properties of the F22 compares to other modern aircrafts. And hence the article shouldn't imply aerodynamical superiority, since the authors simply don't know. The same goes for the sensors, data processing cababilities and trust vectoring.

:&quot;trust vectoring&quot; - that's, um, like, a stealth equivalent of a deception jammer, right?  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)  [[User:Philip Trueman|Philip Trueman]] 14:19, 4 May 2007 (UTC)


So for the sake of &quot;objectivity&quot; maybe &quot;know-not&quot;s should stop making comparisons that they do not have the necessary technical skill nor knowledge to make.

== F-22 foreign Sales and Multi Year Contract  ==

The F-22 foreign sales issue was settled today by Congress along with a multi year contract with Lockheed Martin.

I think someone should add this new development to the F-22 article, and perhaps the part about ANG F-15C's to the Eagle article. 

Thanks

== Deleting OR comparison ==

I have and will delete on sight any uncited comparison between this plane and others, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Basing on maneuverability, F-22 is close to [[Mig-35]], which has slighly higher 1.19 thrust/(loaded) weight ratio and more agile 2D-vectoring engines. However, aside of maneuverability, F-22 is more stealthy, can take twice as much of arming than Mig-35 and has supersonic cruise mode, which is more economic and helps against old types of missiles (that only lead by the heat of afterburners and thus may have less success rate in tracking F-22).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

T/W is not the only benchmark of maneuverability and does not present a complete picture. Concluding anything about maneuverability from a single number is a gross [[WP:OR]] violation. Similarly, &quot;more stealthy, twice as much armament, etc&quot; are all uncited original research and do not belong in an encyclopedia. If you'd like to compare these aircraft, go write an essay or get a job at RAND. --[[User:Mmx1|Mmx1]] 22:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

== BBC Comment Deleted ==

I'm deleting that BBC commet because first and foremost it's bull and does not belong there.  The F-22 has never ever gone up against a Eurofighter, and that comment about stealth aircraft not being able to maneuver is too general and unfounded, with respect to the F-22. I'll post a few Raptor video links if I find them.

--[[User:Noshpit|Noshpit]] 00:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:Australia has never been ''going to buy'' the F-22.  There are some people, notably [[Kim Beazley]], who think we should seriously look at it [http://www.australianflyingcorps.org/story/2006/7/3/81419/12802] instead of the F-35, but the government remains solidly behind a JSF purchase at this stage (though decision time was kicked back from 2006 to 2008 recently). --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 05:45, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

== F-22A Raptor Specifications  ==

I am changing several F-22 specifications due to my calculations below.

The F-22 does not weight 40,000 lb empty it weights 31,670 lb. The 40K figure is an overestimate put out by the USAF on purpose to marginalize F-22 capabilities. The original Lockheed Martin goal was to have the YF-22 weight 30,000 lb, no they did not miss the mark by 10K.

Sources
http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Stu/muddin/F-22.htm
http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-22-specs.htm
http://www.airtoaircombat.com/detail.asp?id=9

* Also, [http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/F_22.html NASA Langley's page] lists an empty weight of  31,670 lb and a MTOW of 60 klb.  This matches the Global Security specs. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 03:45, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

Next, the F-22 does not carry 25,000 lb of internal fuel, again that's just an estimate, the ture figure is 20,650 lb according to an official USAF safety DOC ( Technical Order 00-105E-9) See page 15. The Link is below.

http://www.0x4d.net/files/AF1/R11%20Segment%2012.pdf

Total fuel minus the four external fuel tanks is 20,650 lb.

The F-22 carries the M61A2 gun with 480 20mm rounds for its cannon, the entire system weights 648 pounds. The gun weight 202 lb, feed mechanism weights 176 lb and the ammunition weights 270 lb. The gun and feed mechanism are included in all aircraft produced so they are already part of the empty weight figure, only the ammunition is added on later.

(My Opinion - They need to add more ammo for that gun - The air force always pays dearly when undestimating the dogfighting role - and this thing costs way too much for such mistakes.)

Source
http://www.gdatp.com/Products/PDFs/F-22A.pdf

A normal pilot (average weight 180 lb) and all his flight support systems will weight a total of around 250 lb.

The AIM-120C weighs 356 lb, the F-22A carries six internally, so 6 x 356 lb equals 2,136 lb.

http://www.raytheon.com/products/stellent/groups/rms/documents/content/cms01_054563.pdf

The AIM-9X weights 188 lb, the F-22A carries two internally, so 2 x 188 equals 376 lb. 

http://www.raytheon.com/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_054518.pdf

Now we can truly know the takeoff weight of the F-22A Raptor with a standard air to air load out.
 
31,670 lb + 20,650 lb , + 270 lb, + 250 lb, + 2,136 lb, + 376 lb = 55,352 lb.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:141.158.30.36|141.158.30.36]] ([[User talk:141.158.30.36|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/141.158.30.36|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Stealth section devoid of content and biased ==

The Stealth section is elliptical at best.  It features vague examples of what the F-22 isn't, followed by negative assertions about other stealth aircraft without reference or support. Bias is evident throughout - &quot;plagued by deployment problems...&quot; would be improved by &quot;maintenance heavy&quot;.  There is no actual information about the stealth of the aircraft, or how the F-22 responds to issues raised about the B-2 or F-117.  The entire section is taken from an aviation fan-zine, and struggles from lack of any real meat in the source material. I say this section should be scrapped until '''actual''' non-classified content about the stealth of this aircraft is referenced.  Comparisons of the stealth capability and design approach to other stealth- and non-stealth aircraft would be welcome.  As the F-22 is a &quot;low-observable&quot; ''stealth'' ''fighter'' ''aircraft'', I would think that this is a section of high importance, and the abysmal dearth of content here limits the quality of the whole article severely. -- Metaxis 23:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
: The section could probably use some clean-up.  But with the sources for comparisons cited there's no justification for removing the whole section. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 18:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
:I think Metaxis' claims of &quot;bias&quot; are bunk. It links to a hard article with recent content from one of the most reputable aviation sources in existence. Some of the claims are rather interesting but are well sourced. We might need to add content, but to claim &quot;bias&quot; is not being truthful. To be fair, I do not know much about what the first paragraph is asserting, but those are not the most significant claims. ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' is not a &quot;fan-zine&quot; and is read by aviation industry and financial professionals alike.

== Pointless Stats ==

:''In early 2006, after an exercise involving just eight F-22s in Nevada in Nov. 2005, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hecker, commander of the 27th Fighter Squadron (FS) at Langley AFB, Virginia, commented &quot;We killed 33 F-15Cs and didn't suffer a single loss. They didn't see us at all.&quot;[34]

:In June 2006 during Exercise Northern Edge (Alaska's largest joint military training exercise), the F-22A achieved a 144-to-zero kill-to-loss ratio against F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18s simulating MiG-29 'Fulcrums', Su-30 'Flankers', and other current front line Russian aircraft, which outnumbered the F-22A 4 to 1 at times''

All this stuff about war game stats is kinda dumb considering kills in these games are solely acheivable by gaining radar locks. Of course you will get zero radar locks on a stealth plane, however theoretically they could still be killed by enemy fighters lucky shots.  I'm just saying it's just basically a pointless stat.

== Weight - Engine Thrust ==

According to LTC &quot;Dozer&quot; (Raptor Driver) the F-22's combat loaded weight is around ~64-65K, considering we know all of the other weight variables (as listed previously on this page)that means that the empty weight is roughly ~40K. Also, the same source said that he has sustained more than 9G's in the F-22 while maneuvering (9.5). Furthermore in the Langley 2007 air show the announcer commented that the F-119 produced 37K of thrust (most sources however think the real maximum 39K. I'm making these changes to the official specifications list.

What good are &quot;published&quot; sources when the people who fly the aircraft for a living are telling you otherwise? Considering journalistic ethics are nothing to look up at I'd go with a pilots word any day. Anyway, Is this too considered hearsay from a pilot?...

&quot;Moga noted that he recently pulled 10.2 Gs in the F-22, performing a pullout from a hard turn. The F-22’s specifications say only that the aircraft can pull 9.5 Gs, but can take more, depending on “the ability of the pilot” to bear the pressure. Still, technicians checked the fighter for signs of strain but found none.&quot;  http://dailyreport.afa.org/AFA/Features/newtech/box051807demo.htm

I don't see the need for an account, anyway if 10.2G or 9G for example is not the structural limit of the AC in question (and it's not), nor the limit of pilot, then what is the point of putting down -3 to 9G in the specifications?. Might as well write &quot;classified&quot; or put 9.5+... Or are there no &quot;published&quot; sources reporting such... Also might I remind you that the Raptors FCS places no limit on how many G's can be performed, neither are there speed limitations, that function is left up to the pilot. The Navy however does place a self imposed limit of 7.5G to reduce airframe stress, however even that can be overridden by the pilot in order to make use of the full performance envelope available (if need be).

As for pilots themselves, not all talk for the sake of it, and it is important to distinguish BS from a late night at the O Club from actual first hand accounts and information.

In fact, most computers with IEEE 1394 are IBM-compatible computers and not Apples. I see no reason to showcase one particular brand of computer when the technology is common on many different computers now. It's also misleading, since it leads the reader to believe that the only computers that have the technology are Macs.

Not my changes, but weren't Apple the first to introduce IEEE 1394 (as 'Firewire') and wasn't it a Mac innovation? Common now, it used to be associated principally with the Mac platform.

==Rules for comparable aircrafts==

I propose a clear rule for the chapter “Comparable aircraft” in order to avoid all the nationalis fervor like “F-22 is in a league of it's own” or frustrations like “Why my favorite plane (Typhoon/Rafale) is not included even if it rates almost the same and cost 5 times less”. The comparables planes should the ones that (1) are produced/developed in the same time and (2) have at least some characteristics that are relatively comparable. While some planes are without discussion superior in some scenarios better than the direct competition they may find in a realistic battlefield ether as opponents or allies. More they are regularly compared by governments for acquisitions and in this case the winner is not necessarily decided by quality but also price, availability, easy to maintain, political pressure, corruption.... More it is useless to send an expensive F22 to police the sky of Somalia, a Mig 21 will do the job. BdB[[User:134.157.93.124|134.157.93.124]] 14:09, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

Yeah I know that the data is from Link 1 however all I'm saying is that it's incorrect (or at least not up to date). Since September of 2006 the USAF has begun receiving AC for the 90th FS, and as I said before Raptor's 87 and 88 have been delivered. That means the USAF is in possession of at least 88 Raptors... (Raptor 088 is marked with the tail sign AK 90th FS)

This doesn't sound right. If it's able to climb faster, that means that it either has a better thrust/weight ratio or the aircraft is just more aerodynamic. The fact that the max engine thrust is classified but we know that it climbs faster than the F-15 suggests that it may have more thrust than commonly believed, making the actual thrust/weight ratio better than the F-15's.[[User:TwinTurboZ|TwinTurboZ]] 05:23, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

You should add the Airframe, engine, and avionics costs per aircraft to get a &quot;unit cost&quot; that is comparable to what other aircraft are. Other aircraft's unit costs are calculated in this way. This comes out to $133 million as seen in that budget report. This is what was done for the previous $120million cost as well. Note, the increase in cost is mainly due to the lowering of the amount of aircraft being produced per year. 24 F-22s were being built per year before, but only 20 per year are being built from now on, so this rises total unit cost.[[User:129.82.86.201|129.82.86.201]] 09:34, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

==Verifiable sources==
Bill CJ
You &quot;Reverted unsourced, good-faith additions by 90.240.101.73&quot; on the F-22, on the basis that they were not from a verifiable source. You reverted to a form of words that was plainly, demonstrably wrong, which is witless - even if there was a verifiable source, and you reverted to something that gave a false, misleading impression.

The points at issue were connected with the F-22's capability in the SEAD, EW and AWACS roles.

Because of its sensor capabilities, F-22 does have POTENTIAL in these roles, but this potential is limited by the aircraft's inability to transmit any sensor data to other platforms, except by voice radio. The Raptor pilot can therefore report by radio, but this falls far short of a genuine AWACS or ISTAR capability.

The existing IFDL (Intra Flight Data Link) is limited to communicating with other Raptors, and its Link 16 capability is austere (text messages only) and Receive Only.

This was confirmed by Larry Lawson, the F-22 Programme Manager in his presentation at the Paris Air Show, and was reported in Flight Daily News. It was also confirmed by Colonel Sutter, Chief of ACC/A8F, 5th Generation Fighter Division, and can be inferred from the Air Force Link article at http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123024639

In answer to the question:
Is it true that the F-22 intraflight datalink cannot communicate with other tactical platforms, AWACS, Rivet Joint JSTARS, etc? (…..thereby limiting F-22 pilots to voice radio?) Is an F-22 pilot limited to voice radio?

Sutter answered:
Currently, F-22s link with each other but do not link with other platforms except thru voice radio.

Nor is the F-22's APG-77 being given a high bandwidth transmission capability. This was explicitely denied by Lawson, though it remains an unfunded future option, alongside Link 16 TX/RX, and TTNT.

::I'd like to jump in here... without a DL the F-22 is absolutely useless in any of the roles under discussion. Even with the addition of a good DL, the most one can expect the F-22 to do is act as a sort of remote sensor suite that would forward intel back to a real platform. I don't expect anyone here would argue that we might have F-22 pilots directing an air war while in the cockpit.
::The extremely broad language used in the body of the article means that ''any'' aircraft with a radar could be used, it may as well be a F-15, or a Mosquito for that matter. I don't see claims in those articles suggesting this will happen though.
::So unless there is some good evidence that these sorts of upgrades ''will'' be made, I'd prefer to see the entire section removed. And frankly, I trust AvLeak exactly as far as I can throw it. While it may be true that statements at a meeting cannot be used for CITE I'd still say they trump AvLeak. IE, in this case we have a rather dubious claim from AvLeak that I simply don't believe, countered by direct evidence to the contrary. Although it is reasonable to suggest that the direct evidence cannot be included due to its &quot;format&quot;, that just argues for the entire section being removed, IMHO.

== GAO Report and Eurofighter Dogfight ==

There has been a user spamming info in F-22 videos, such as this one http://youtube.com/watch?v=fBUmRd4hKlg and used a source that a Eurofighter beat an F-22 in a mock digfight. I've actually heard rumors about this happening long before:

&quot;The Eurofighter have already beaten the F22 - take this source:

&quot;international AIR POWER REVIEW&quot; - year 2006, issue 20, page 45. - ISNB: 1-880588-91-9 (casebound) or ISBN: 1473-9917. 

&quot;Two RAF Typhoons deployed to the USA for OEU trails work have been flying against the F-22 at NAS China Lake. There was little suprise that the Typhoon, with its world-class agility and high off-boresight missile capability was able to dominate &quot;Within Visual Range&quot; flight..&quot;  

He has also been spreading around info, using the US Congress GOA report as a source, saying that the F-22 is severely flawed and has even made a video into it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvgBbXKL5E

Now I'm wondering, how much of this stuff is actually true? [[User:Tsurugi|Tsurugi]] 10:33, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

* What's the GAO report?  This one: [http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO/NSIAD-99-55 F-22 Issues in Achieving.., March 1999] or what?  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 18:43, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

He was getting quotes from several other GAO reports from different years as well. [[User:Tsurugi|Tsurugi]] 11:57, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

:According to what I could find online, the relevant quote from the source reads, &quot;During evaluations and trials at NAS China Lake last year two Typhoons were pitched against F-22s. The Typhoons excelled in close range combat with the F-22s, but surprised everybody by locking on to the F-22s before the F-22s could get a lock-on on the Typhoons during BVR trials as well.&quot;  No context, such as whether this was reported by the source as a rumor or a solid source, nor what the rules of engagement might have been (e.g., a non-jamming environment, whether it was just a ‘BVR rodeo’ with no advantage taken of the Raptor’s BVR strengths, etc.).  Since the F-22 is optimized for BVR combat, I wouldn’t consider it to be too surprising that the Typhoon – designed with a stronger emphasis on dogfighting maneuverability – could get a first lock-on in WVR.  A very powerful radar at close range could detect an extremely stealthy airplane like the F-22.  Low RCS means it takes much more radar power at a given range to detect it, so significant power at short range could have the same effect.  As for maneuver performance, even if the F-22 dominated 90% of the performance envelope with respect to the Eurofighter (about which I have no idea) and the Typhoon’s pilot managed to maneuver his opponent into the 10% where the Typhoon has the upper hand, well then, that’s what a well-trained, top-notch pilot tries to do.

:Such a snippet – of unknown reliability – certainly doesn’t support the recent POV vandalisms that the Raptor is “easy to shoot down.”  Nor does much of anything in the 1999 GAO report on the YF-22 ''prototype development'' retain any relevance to today’s ''operational production'' F-22.  Until something more substantive is offered and sourced, I believe that reverting such POV fluff, as our editors have been doing, remains the right thing to continue to do.

[[User:Tsurugi|Tsurugi]] 16:25, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

:Since this particular GAO publication is so recent, it is much more appropriate to cite.  However, two-page assessments like these don’t tend to include much context, unlike the more detailed, program-specific evaluations the GAO produces from time-to-time; also these latter publications also provide room for the owning service to respond to key points as to whether or not they concur with its findings.  GAO findings always tend to always sound “cataclysmic” or nearly so to readers with little understanding of how complex, advanced technology programs are developed.  For one thing, it needs to be kept in mind that the GAO criticizes anything that isn’t “low-risk” as “immature”; the typical standard seems to follow a logic along the lines of “Buggy whips are ‘mature’; advanced technologies are not – until everybody else is already using them.”  Their findings are inevitably subjective; in fact, this is the first time I’ve seen them use a non-arbitrary scale like the one in Appendix III for evaluating military aerospace technologies, but then they mis-apply it as well.  Since the F-22 entered service in December 2005, it was essentially Technology Readiness Level 8 (not 7) by the time they began their investigations.  Moreover, if every system, subsystem and component were individually tested to the “realism” standard required for Level 7, the aircraft cost would probably grow by at least an order of magnitude. 

:As the GAO correctly points out, the three critical technologies needed for the modernization program as it was configured in 2003 were “mature”; the three new critical technologies were added later to the modernization program as desirable to achieve, essentially, Technology Readiness Level 9, if you will.  The whole purpose of adding them ''was'' to “mature” them.  How the GAO can say, “Overall technology maturity is consequently lower now than when the modernization effort began” is quite beyond me.  In any case, given their nature, I doubt that whatever progress made on the three identified technologies will be broadly reported.
:* The reliability and maintainability issue is a legitimate one – and not uncommon in early production aircraft.  To some degree it’s also due to ironing out the kinks in the spare parts flow.  The fault isolation software and the thermal management systems are part of this issue, and the former may have been resolved by now.  From what I’ve read, the F-22’s reliability has improved considerably, but I don’t know how well it is progressing toward making its 100,000 flying-hour goal in 2010, so I don’t know how much of an issue it is.

:* The Structural Retrofit Program (SRP) is under way, although other sources report that only 41 aircraft need the modification.  The two fatigue problems aren’t likely to make the plane unsafe to fly anytime soon, but rather shorten its overall expected service life.  The USAF doesn’t appear to think either of them is urgent.

:The way I read it, these are normal problems for a “juvenile” high-technology, highly complex fighter design and it sounds like all of them should be settled by 2010.  In the grand scheme of things, the GAO’s findings are minor and being dealt with.  More apropos and important are the issues that have long been raised about whether or not the design approach employed on the F-22 are the best-suited for the modern and future missions it will be called upon to perform.  If it works perfectly but is irrelevant, it doesn’t matter much.  [[User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Askari Mark|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:03, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

Well, compare this discussion to the sentence &lt;i&gt;... The US Air Force claims that the F-22A cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft... &lt;/i&gt;, a claim without solid foundation and surely carrying a load of bias - right in the introduction as a crucial part of the article. Bitching about the source for the GAO-story and not including it in the proper context, maybe with a critical remark, seems like applying a double standard here. But as you may have noticed, every version of wikipedia has it's very own shortcomings, and this one's the desire to portray the US' holy grails as bright as possible, being less critical and more selective. Would the GAO-report support the &quot;F22's superiority&quot;, it would be in the article, it's really as easy as that. [[User:88.65.252.208|88.65.252.208]] 13:03, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

:[[User:Tsurugi|Tsurugi]], I’m sorry I haven’t responded sooner, but work and family demands have kept me off-wiki for the last couple of weeks.  Regarding Zeptocomp’s You Tube video, well, anyone can gather everything negative they can find on a subject, take it out of its proper context, and emphasize it beyond any reasonable point of relevancy, so I cannot say I’m impressed.  I find critiques to be more helpful than diatribes.  As most of the editors around here are aware, I don’t get into all of this “my-favorite-airplane-is-better-than-your-favorite-airplane” dueling that often goes on in these articles.  As I’ve pointed out any number of times, every modern fighter has a place in its maneuver envelope where it can out-perform any of the others.  The only way in which we can meaningfully say that one airplane is “better” than another is in a single characteristic or combat engagement situation.  As for the IAPR claim, I’ll address that in more detail in the subsection below.

:In any case, since You Tube is not deemed a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] by Wikipedia, Zeptocomp’s work is irrelevant here.  As for [[User:88.65.252.208|88.65.252.208’s]] criticism of the USAF claim in the intro, I’m somewhat sympathetic.  The sentence is “acceptable” in that it is clearly a factual statement of ''what the USAF claims'' to be true and cites a reliable source for it.  However, it is obviously a statement of what the USAF’s bias is with regard to its airplane, and IMHO would be inappropriate anywhere else ''but'' in the intro.  It’s equally obvious that the USAF statement is itself bombast since, as I noted above, no single aircraft can best all others “known or planned” across the board in ''all'' areas of performance, capabilities and technologies – albeit there are no doubt more than a few in which the F-22 does excel.  In the end, it ''macht’s nichts'' to me whether it’s kept or removed – and if that was this article’s only problem, it would still be an FA-class article.

ADDING EUROFIGHTER DOGFIGHT TO PERFORMANCE
I have added the Eurofighter Dogfight to performance... I then saw the discussions here. I don't agree with removing this reference (and I am not the guy you claimed to be responsible for the Utube and spams). The eurofighter engagement happened, it is a very reliable source and well documented. If these comparisons wouldn't have been fair, the USAF would have hardly agreed to send their F-22. So citing theoretical arguments to remove a real world engagement backed up with sources is not appropriate. Especially since you claim to not know the Eurofighter. At the end lets list the engagements that took place in real world and leave the speculations and simulations and your paper calculations on the side. Also before removing this source, please get the source in question, read it yourself first.

Also in regards to removing the other sources (a 2007 source even) just because you think it's not reliable or warranted is wrong. Honestly I think a 1999 or 2007 congressional report is a pretty reliable assessment and whether it still applies or not is irrelevant since the source contains the date and the user knows that is is older if he can see the date. 

If you have a later source you can claim that the issues have been fixed and add the later source. However just reading this discussion and the deliberate removal of anything that sounds remotely negative seems wrong to me - it almost would want me to use the latest wiki-changes tracking tools to see where/what computer your edits are coming from... that might add some more information to this discussion or even topic.

Then my other request is to REMOVE the following quote:
&quot;Marshal Angus Houston, chief of the Australian Defence Force, and former head of the Royal Australian Air Force, said in 2004 that the &quot;F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built&quot;&quot; 
The reason being that the quote is a pretty stupid thing to say and reflects more the Marshal rather then saying anything about the plane. First recent engagements show that this statement is simply not true. Second to use &quot;EVER&quot; in his statement is simply a dumb thing to say. I am sure there will be hundreds of fighter planes in the coming 1,000 years that will be much more outstanding then the F-22 - in fact I can think of a large number of planes in the previous century that were A WHOLE LOT more outstanding and revolutionary. Just because someone said something doesn't mean it should be included if what they say is just marketing talk.

===Findings regarding the ''IAPR'' report of Typhoon-F-22 engagement===
Although real-life has kept me off-wiki for the last couple of weeks, I have been trying to see what I could uncover about the incident alleged to have happened by the ''IAPR''.  So far I have found not the slightest confirmation that the event ever occurred and many reasons to disbelieve the report altogether.

The article as a whole is essentially an unapologetic puff piece on the Typhoon; that doesn’t mean anything written in it is automatically untrue, but it does caution any reader to beware of possible bias in anything uncited – and nothing regarding the Typhoon vs. F-22 incident is sourced, either internally or by footnote.  The entirety of what was written about the story is a single paragraph:

:''Though still a relatively immature platform, Typhoon has already proved to be a hard opponent to beat, so that when a two-seat trainer was bounced by two F-15s during an operational conversion sortie, the Typhoon pilot was easily able to outmanoeuvre his assailants and position himself for a simulated ‘kill’ against both.  More recently, there have been repeated reports that two RAF Typhoons deployed to the USA for OEU trials work have been flying against the F-22 at NAS China Lake, and have performed better than was expected.  There was little surprise that Typhoon, with its world-class agility and high off-boresight missile capability was able to dominate the ‘Within Visual Range’ fight, but the aircraft did cause a surprise by getting a radar lock on the F-22 at a surprisingly long range.  The F-22s reportedly cried off, claiming that they were ‘unstealthed’ anyway, although the next day’s scheduled two versus two BVR engagement was cancelled, and “the USAF decided they didn’t want to play any more.”  When this incident was reported on a website frequented by front-line RAF aircrew a senior RAF officer urged an end to the conversation on security grounds.''

The F-15 engagement [http://eucitizens.eu/Forum/index.php?topic=166.msg271#msg271 reported] is reliably attested to by multiple reliable sources, so it is not at issue.  (However, as the [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=673262005 ''Scotsman''] makes a little clearer, the fighters involved were F-15E Strike Eagles, not the F-15C air superiority version, and it would have been shameful for the Typhoon to have been bested by these heavier, less-maneuverable birds.)  In fact, one has to wonder if the Typhoon vs. F-22 report isn’t a garbled version of this event.

For this latter, the ''IAPR'' article mentions uncited “repeated reports” (which I’ve been so far unable to find online), but then goes on to refer to only the forum website report.  (Perhaps the “repeated reports” were multiple acquaintances telling him about the website post?)  The author seems to have only secondhand information on the forum – which goes unnamed (just like the “senior RAF officer”).  While he mentions that it is “frequented by front-line RAF aircrew”, the original forum post appears to not have been made by someone in the RAF nor a witness to the alleged events – otherwise he would have said so to gain greater credibility.  Furthermore, RAF professionals or in-place witnesses would not make the mistake of claiming that the F-22 flew against the Typhoon at NAS China Lake.  That’s a US Navy facility, and the US Air Force has its own equivalent facilities.  (Both do offer these facilities to the air forces of allied nations for testing that can’t be duplicated in-country at reasonable expense.)

Of the knowledgeable people I’ve spoken to, few had ever heard of this allegation and all were all but sure that the F-22 has not (yet) been to China Lake nor has it been flown in mock engagements against the Typhoon specifically or against any aircraft flown by non-US personnel.  Of course, one can never prove with 100% certainty that such an event occurred and was highly classified – given how security rules go regarding stealth technology – but it seems unlikely.  In fact, it reads more like “something made up on the Internet one day.”  As it stands, all we have is a report of a rumor on a web forum about a rumor from an unknown source posted by someone without first-hand knowledge or professional experience.  Until there is evidence based on what Wikipedia considers to be reliable sources, there seems to be no reason to include the alleged incident at all. [[User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Askari Mark|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:22, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:Hmm... one has to look at the context here. When entering F22 or eurofighter the wikipedia articles pop up as number 2 -3 on google. Each airplane costs millions of dollars - or billions when looking at contracts. The recent typhoon saudi deal is worth 75 billion. Here is what really happened to my opinion: The meeting took place, but once the results were made public, ANYTHING will be done from the US Side to suppress it, discredit it or mention it has ever happened. You likely won't find any USA military person who will confirm anything - their carreer would be over BIG TIME. In fact I think it would probably make sense from a manufacturers point of view to spend some $ and make sure that the number 2-3 spots on the web don't mention this incident - or even hint towards it. After all it would be disastrous if an army spends twice as much $ on a plane that might not be superior. At the end its economic interest... but I think it's wrong to have Wikipedia be ruled by those interests and allow to have these edits continue. The source is a respected print publication - I highly doubt that a wikipedia admin has more knowledge/clout then a print magazine subscribed to by probably all airforces in this world.

:So let's face it - these 2 entries F22 / Typhoon are absolutely crucial and can win/lose millions for the countries economies.

I think a professional aviation publication subscribed to by all major AF in the world is a valid source period - and if you think the source lied then bring proof.. until then the source is valid - period.

:Let me make my point clear, because it was obviously over your head the last time. Firstly, the forum '''''isn't even named''''', so it's veracity cannot be judged. Second, forums do not in any way '''ever''' constitute a reliable source. Third, what academic source has reviewed the article in question and found it to be suitable or reliable? Perhaps you should read the Wikipedia policy page on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] before you start calling people fools. And sign your posts; it's just 4 tildes. [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] 00:51, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

::First off, [[User:76.102.190.6|76.102.190.6]], Wikipedia has a policy of [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith]] on the behalf of other editors, so unless and until you have firm evidence that I or some other editor is shilling for the USAF, you shouldn’t make the assertion.  It would be the same as someone calling you a shill for Eurofighter simply because you’re a fan of that airplane.  As it is, I think my track record for non-partisanship on Wikipedia is well-attested to by my work.  I also happen to be an aerospace engineer with three decades of experience who has worked with other professionals from many different companies and countries, so I have a broad range of contacts and considerable knowledge about how the “real world” of aerospace works.  Since I found the purported incident personally and professionally interesting, I decided to explore and see what I could learn about it, if anything.  (Contrary to popular opinion, not all embarrassments get classified.)

::As I noted above, it’s impossible to prove the incident never occurred somewhat along the lines described in the ''IAPR'' article; however, there’s nothing more than rumor to assert that it ever actually happened.  Given vague claims with no identification of sources other than a “forum frequented by front-line RAF aircrew” (for beer and grins perhaps?), all we have is a third-hand rumor at best, and one containing enough inaccurate content in that single paragraphs to raise at least some concern regarding the original source’s grasp of the subject matter.  While that may be sufficient “reliability” for ''IAPR'', it flunks Wikipedia’s explicit guidelines for “'''[[WP:RS|reliable sources]]'''” as well as its standards for '''[[WP:V|verifiability]]'''.  Should a ''reliable source'' be found to establish that the incident actually occurred, then I would by all means encourage coverage of the alleged incident here.  If true, it would be an embarrassment to the USAF and Lockheed Martin, but it certainly won’t embarrass me.  Until then, however, there seems to be less to it than a typical ''National Enquirer'' story.

(For those who aren’t aware of it, Prnewswire is a press release distribution service – companies and organizations pay them to distribute their press releases to news providers – and, as such, it is not considered a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] in of itself.)  First, the F-15E engagement occurred over the UK in the Lakes District, not NAS China Lake.  Second, while I do strongly suspect that ‘Exercise High Rider 10’ is the event at which the author of the ''IAPR'' article (and his source) believe the purported F-22 engagement occurred, even this Eurofighter press release makes no assertion that the Typhoon’s weapons trials at China Lake involved any non-RAF aircraft.  It you read the article, it appears the only opponent aircraft involved were the Harrier GR.7 and Tornado GR.4 aircraft of the RAF’s Fast Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit (FJWOEU) that deployed with the Typhoon (from the Typhoon combined test team).  Note that Eurofighter says only a single Typhoon was deployed, not two (as the ''IAPR'' article states); this is another strike against the accuracy of the story published by ''IAPR'', and an unqualified one given that there are no “security” reasons why they couldn’t have said there were two, if there had been.

:::Let's face it the engagement has happened. I think the press release and the exercise name are hints for people who want to , to dig a bit deeper. As a manufacturer you can't claim X beat Y... but the press release provides plenty of information. It just named what aircraft from Europe were deployed but not which one they competed against.
I am still concerned by the bias that is being adopted here. The claim at the beginning of the article is pure &quot;marketing&quot; and has no place on wikipedia, the fact that it is left there shows my earlier assumption of a pr war. I'll remove it to protest it. The claim that &quot;cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter&quot; is simply marketing BS and not worthy wikipedia.... ITS MARKETING period - and any discussion about it is useless and just shows bias. 
Let's face it guys. The Typhoons raped the Raptors at NAS china lake and there are tons of people working on hiding that fact.

== Air Show - Toronto Picture ==
[[Image:F22atToronto02SEP07.jpg|thumb|right|The Raptor at the The Canadian International Air Show, Toronto, Ontario, 2007]]

The F-22 Raptor flown by an international landmark--the [[CN Tower]]--during its first public demonstration outside of the United States on the long weekend of September 1-3, 2007. This is undeniable an historic event. The event was captured on the picture (right). Some wikipedia contributors insist in removing the picture from the main article, their objection being that the picture is low quality. Truly, this is why this picture is published under the &quot;Trade Show&quot; heading: it is meant to be a record of a life event, not a glossy sales brochure. The article shows plenty of other quality pictures of the aircraft. If someone has a better quality picture to illustrate the subject event, be my guest and replace it. Until then, this picture may be the best available to illustrate that historic event.

Before someone just single-mindedly reject someone else's contribution, at least first take a breather, write up your thoughts in this &quot;talk&quot; section, then let's see toghether what is best for this publication.--[[User:JLdesAlpins|JLdesAlpins]] 23:00, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I've removed the pic. Please don't re-add it without a consensus to do so. In addition, I've never been happy with the &quot;Air Show&quot; section in this article, so I've removed that too. What other fighter article on Wkipedia even has one? It smacks of [[WP:OR|Original Research]], even if the individual items are sourced. I don't think the section is very relevant overall, and certainly an article on F-22 airshow appearences would be a bad idea. I agree with Fnlayson (Jeff) that [[Canadian International Air Show]] would be a more appropriate place for such a pic, tho I agree with the original deleter of the pic that this one is poor quality.

==Data link==

This article currently reads: ''In 2007, tests carried out by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and L-3 Communications enabled the AESA system of a Raptor to act like a WiFi access point, able to transmit data at 548 Megabit/sec and receive at Gigabit speed, far faster than the current Link 16 system used by US and allied aircraft, which transfers data at just over 1 Megabit/sec.'' However, the [[Link 16]] page claims a data rate of 31.6kbits to 115.2kbits/sec, about a tenth of that. The higher rate comes unsourced from an article at The Register, which is generally slightly less accurate than reading sheep entrails.

::Wrong in the end Jumper says the following: The F/A-22 performs in much the same way as the Eurofighter, General Jumper said. But it has additional capabilities that allow it to perform the Air Force's unique missions.

&quot;The F/A-22 Raptor has stealth and supercruise,&quot; he said. &quot;It has the ability to penetrate virtually undetected because of (those) capabilities. It is designed to be a penetrating airplane. It can maneuver with the best of them if it has to, but what you want to be able to do is get into contested airspace no matter where it is.&quot;
:: Notice he says ADDITIONAL CAPABILITES. Thinking that the Typhoon is anything more than a 4th generation fighter is sheer stupidity.

:*If you're asking if it's a reliable source, yes. It explains the &quot;kill&quot; as follows:
::&lt;blockquote&gt;''The exercise was focused on training the youngest and newest F-22 pilots, according to Bergeson. Nearly one-third of the pilots involved in the F-22's portion of the exercise had less than 50 flight hours on the aircraft. The &quot;red&quot; force of aggressors consisted of various F-15s and F-16s that were able to regenerate upon sustaining damage; thus they were able to constantly flow into and out of the fight, maintaining a rigorous operational tempo.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::&lt;blockquote&gt;''The friendly &quot;blue&quot; force lost one F-22 during the exercise, Bergeson says. He attributes the loss to a confusing &quot;mulligan,&quot; whereby an enemy &quot;red&quot; fighter regenerated or re-entered the fight unbeknownst to the blue forces. &quot;We made some tactical mistakes and one slipped through,&quot; Bergeson told reporters Feb. 27 during a telecom from Langley Air Force Base, Va., upon returning from the deployment. Apparently, the F-22 pilot did not realize the aggressor was not out of the fight and should have continued to attack the aircraft.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::The article also noted that one-third of the F-22 pilots involved had less than 50 hours in type, and that the F-22's AESA capabilities were not being factored in during the simulation.

[[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] 11:59, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
:::::This F-22 kill was notable because the aircraft was sold on its superiority over others. On paper (and I emphasize paper) it's supposed to eat F15's and 16's and pretty much anything else out there for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and have more appetite for snacks in-between. What the article fails to mention is that the aircraft has an incredible integrated avionics and weapons suite, which increases the learning curve, but once mastered, is a multiplier to the lethality of the aircraft. I wouldn't be surprised if this one loss also helps the Raptor drivers learn some humility and hence is an excellent learning opportunity for all.

::::::Fighter pilots made humble??? I don't think that's possible. In any case, since shot-down fighters don't normally get to regenerate themselves in reality in mid-air and immediately return to battle, it's more a game-induced error. What it does emphasize is that no matter how &quot;dominant&quot; a fighter is, none is utterly invincible; their pilots will always be vulnerable to &quot;surprises&quot; – and it's usually the one you didn't see that gets you.

==air dominance?==

I'm not an expert or even a buff... but most planes like this are listed as &quot;air superiority&quot;. This one is &quot;air dominance&quot;, which if you look it up, doesn't actually have a compatible definition.   &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.174.107.130|68.174.107.130]] ([[User talk:68.174.107.130|talk]]) 16:24, 4 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:There isn't a formal definition of &quot;air dominance&quot;; it's more a phrase intended to underscore that it not only is a top &quot;air superiority&quot; fighter in the traditional sense, but also has electronic, network-centric, stealth and other performance capabilities never seen before.

Reverting other's &quot;good faith edits&quot; constantly and not seeking a resolution here is in contravention of the guidelines established by Wikipedia. Since I assume you are a new editor, let me review the guidelines that all Wikipedia editors follow. The basic tenets of Wikipedia use include:  
* Respect your fellow Wikipedians even when you may not agree with them; 
* Be civil. Avoid making personal attacks or sweeping generalizations; 
* Stay cool when the editing gets hot;
* Avoid edit wars and follow the three-revert rule; 
* Act in good faith; 	 
* Never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point; 	 
* Assume good faith on the part of others, and 	 
* Be open and welcoming. 

At this point, you have been in contravention of all of these guidelines and although these tenets are established to illustrate and guide progress, they are the &quot;backbone&quot; of civil discourse in what is primarily an &quot;open&quot; forum. FWIW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] 06:19, 7 October 2007 (UTC).

:BZuk, unless I'm greeatly mistaken, this is a user (Wikizilla) who has been banned for edit-warring and sock-puppetry. It's already demonstrated it's not interested in rules. Let's try to concentrate on forming a consensus without it, since they have no interest in gaining a consensus. For the record, gaining a consensus is not about ignoring &quot;facts&quot;, but about convincing others that your facts are what should be presented. The USAF calls it an &quot;Air dominance fighter&quot;, and no one disputes that, nor is anyone saying that can't be in the text. Should we use what is apparently a marketing term to describe one individual type fighter in the Infobox? The infobox is there to present a quick summary of information to those unfamilar with the type, or those wanting a quick overview. As such, we should use more general categories, not plane-specific terms. THose who disagree should focus on why such a narrow term should be used in the infobox. Up to this point, no attempt has been made to do this. Instead, a bunch of quotes have been thrown out, and then unilateral changes made to the article.

So where are we on the debate – and attempt to gain consensus – regarding what generic class of fighter the F-22 is?  So far, the only evidence offered by those who insist on “air dominance” – on their “say so” – have been the following:

# A “[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA398411 formal definition of air dominance]” that doesn’t define it.
# A [http://www.f22-raptor.com/government/dominance.html contractor webpage] (see the copyright notice) that they say also defines “air dominance”, but doesn’t – it just offers a list generic F-22 capabilities under a header of “air dominance” and makes no attempt to define just what the concept entails.
# Unsourced assertions that the USAF officially calls the F-22 “air dominance fighter” (in preference to “air superiority fighter” or “stealth fighter” or “next-generation fighter” or “5th-generation fighter” or “fighter aircraft” or several other appellations that can be found in USAF, DoD, or other US government entities).
# A [http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=199 http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=199 USAF fact sheet] that mentions two-thirds the way down the page a single summary info line that reads “Primary Function: Air dominance, multi-role fighter”, quite ignoring not only the fact that the very first line just calls it a “fighter”, but ''nowhere in text of the main article is the F-22 called an “air dominance fighter”''.

I’ve invited them to offer the USAF's formal definition of “Air Dominance” and to show that the F-22's original requirements were for it to be an &quot;air dominance fighter&quot; – in short, to prove that there is such a thing (that is, beyond “marketing-speak”) – but no dice.  Yet, somehow, we’re supposed to accept that one term among the many terms the USAF uses to describe the F-22 as both “official” and meaning something – as yet unidentified – more than “air superiority fighter”.  Kind of hard to kowtow to the sort of “evidence” that is really based on nothing more than “Trust me, I know better than you.”

And, yes, the USAF freely uses other terms for the F-22 with just as much aplomb.  A few examples (emphasis added in all cases):

# [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/bookstaber.html The Air University’s &quot;Air &amp; Space Power Journal&quot;:] “Meanwhile, however, the Air Force has spent close to $20 billion on engineering and manufacturing development of the '''F-22 air superiority fighter''' (which will cost at least $100 million per copy to produce).”
# [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/vorspr03.html Same source:] “For example, '''the F/A-22, the Air Force’s new air-superiority fighter''', only recently received congressional approval for production.”
# [http://www.milnet.com/pentagon/usaf/F-22.htm MILNET fact sheet entitled:] “MILNET: '''F-22 Raptor Air Superiority Fighter'''”
# [http://aupress.maxwell.af.mil/Maxwell_papers/Text/Cate_MP30.pdf Air University Press publication:]  Title: “The '''Air Superiority Fighter''' and Defense Transformation; Why DOD Requirements Demand the '''F/A-22 Raptor'''” Foreword written by USAF '''Maj Gen Bentley B. Rayburn, Commandant, Air War College''' (Think he’d know?):  “In this paper, Lt Col Devin L. Cate tackles the question of whether an air superiority fighter is relevant to warfare in the twenty-first century. Critics of the '''F/A-22, the US Air Force’s next generation air superiority fighter''', have identified it as a cold war relic—unjustifiably expensive and out of step with the Department of Defense (DOD) transformation.” 
# [http://www.af.mil/news/airman/1201/world6.html &quot;Airman&quot;, an official USAF publication:]  “Plans call for the F-35 to be the world’s premier strike aircraft through 2040, said Edward C. ‘Pete’ Aldridge Jr., under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. ‘It will provide air-to-air capability second only to the '''F-22 air superiority fighter''',” he said.”  (Think he’d know?)
# [http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0202/cover4.html Same source:] “An F-22 Raptor soars high above the Sierra Nevada. '''The Air Force’s new air superiority fighter''' will dominate the future air combat arena by integrating advanced avionics, stealth and supercruise.”
# [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123063874 Air Force Link, the USAF’s official website: ] “Elmendorf became the second operational base and the first Pacific Air Forces installation to receive '''the Air Force's new superiority fighter'''.”  (The term “air dominance” shows up nowhere.)
# [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123013789http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123013789 Same source:] “Far from being just boxes of materiel or the world's largest model kit, this cargo, once assembled by the men and women of the F-22 test force, became''' the first of what is now officially the air superiority fighter''' providing air dominance for the Joint Force, the F-22A aircraft called ‘Raptor 1.’” (Note that “air dominance is just something the F-22 “air superiority fighter” provides.)
# [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123020150 Same source:] Article title: “'''Raptors to bring air superiority''' to Northern Edge 2006”  “The F-22A, a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force, is designed to project air dominance rapidly and at great distances and defeat threats attempting to deny access to the nation's Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps.”  (Again, “air dominance” is something it “projects”.)
# [http://www.f22-raptor.com/about/index.html Also on the same LM F-22 website that the anons link as &quot;proof&quot; the USAF has named it an &quot;air dominance fighter&quot;:] “As '''the world’s only operational fifth-generation fighter''', the F-22 Raptor is, and will remain, unprecedented in its total integration of stealth and advanced avionics. … This fighter will provide air dominance and a precision ground attack capability for U.S. forces for the next 40 years.”

So, as you can see, the USAF is just as comfortable with using the term “air superiority fighter” to describe the F-22 as it is with “air dominance fighter” – and these sources date from 1997 to 2007.  There is nothing official or even semi-official about the latter term and therefore no reason to prefer it over anything else.  Let’s ignore the trolls, please, and get on with improving the article.

I added a subsection to cover the F-22's airframe.  The changes from the YF-22 to F-22 are there now.  Another subsection just for that seems like oversectioning.  I plan to add some description of the airframe's basic features.  I don't see the chines mentioned.  Also, the airframe uses a lot of composite skins and titanium. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 03:05, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

The airframe subsection uses the adjective small describing the airframe changes from the YF-22 to the F-22, but the changes mentioned are substantial- reduced the sweep of the leading edge, resized the tail, moving the cockpit, moving the inlets.  Would it be more accurate to just leave out the word- small especially when the difference is described as substantial in a section deeper in the article?

* The external fuel seems odd.  I've never seen anything about the F-22 actually using external hardpoints for anything.  That'd mess up its stealthiness. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 17:15, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
[[Image:F22-051122-01cr.jpg|thumb|right|Two F-22s with external tanks over Mojave Airport, November 2005]]
::I have. It allows the F-22 to carry a greater load of fuel and/or weapons when stealth is not a factor, such as after the enemy's anti-air capability has been eliminated. I suspect that drop tanks could be used on the initial ingress to the target to extend range, then dropped before entering hostile space. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] 17:21, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
::* That makes sense.  I don't think my F-22 book mentions that or I haven't run across it yet.  The F-35 will probably have more of that. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] 17:26, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

::My Frawley Military book states it has 4 hardpoints capabel of 5000 lbs each. THough I haven't found a direct reference to when it would carry external weapons, it would make no sense to build heavier wings that could structurally carry external stores if you knew you could never use them. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] 17:35, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

* The F-22 was specifically designed with the capability for external hardpoints, where (as mentioned above) stealth was not a factor, or the need was dire. Every missile in service in the USAF can be fitted to said hardpoints, as can aforementioned drop tanks.
Also, however, external munitions or fuel also slow the plane down. Supercruising would cost more fuel, and the top speed would be limited, by a few mph or a couple hundred, depending on cargo. In addition to this, the Raptor's manueverability is also limited by external usage, and is why internal stores are so important with the this plane. Hope this helps![[User:!Darkfire!6'28'14|Darkƒire]] 23:15, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

I added the heading mainly because the whole section was getting too long, and the Hulk topic made a good place to start.

PLease realize that many Wikipeidians active in the MILHIST, Aircraft and Aviation Projects consider themsleve (myself included) to be &quot;serious editors&quot;. As such, we want the content of aircraft aritcles to focus solely on the aircraft itself, without ANY coverage of trivia (per [[WP:ATRIV]] guidelines) or the similar Popular culture sections. Many of these editors are aircraft mechanics, pilots, military officers (or both) and veteran enlisted personel, industry-related engineers and designers, light aircraft owners, aviation writers or people otherwise associated with the aircraft. Others, like myself, just have a long love for aircraft, and have read many serious avitaion publications for many years (since age 12 in my case). On the other hand, there many Wiki users whose primary connection to aircraft and military equipment is through video games, popular novels, movies, TV, anime, and comics. THese users tend to feel that EVERY appearance that they can persoanlly remember is import, and thus should be listed. THis is understandable, as everyone wants to contribute to Wikipeida, and it's easy to say, &quot;I saw the X-xxX in this movie!&quot; Or &quot;THis aircraft is in Mental Smear Solid State.&quot;
*I would consider myself an enthusiast in the former category, although I do watch movies from time to time.[[User:Happysomeone|Happysomeone]] 17:26, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

Obviously, the two extreams cannot co-exist simultaneously. Recognizing there need to be some kind of compromise, MILHIST developed guidelines based on Wikipedia's [[WP:TRIV|Avoid trivia sections]] policy/guidelines. WP:AIR followed with guidelines optimized for aircraft airticles, and limited apperances to those that were &quot;especially notable&quot; or in which the aircraft played a &quot;major&quot; role. Obviously, &quot;especially notable&quot; and &quot;major&quot; are open to interpretation, so in cases were ther are disputes, WP:AIR has required sources attesting to the appearances' notability, based on Wikipedia's [[WP:N|Notability Policy]] for articles.

Rembember, this IS policy: ''WIkipeia is NOT a collection of lists, which is invariably what pop-culture sections turn into if they are not constantly pruned/cut back. We've even tried having pop-culture aritcles for Helicopters or specific, but it turned into such a messy cruft magnet that when the deletion-nazis went after it, we had no way to justify keeping it.

But rather than help solve the problem, may users want to argue incessantly over what constitutes notability. This is to the point now where serious editors like myself are ready to throw away the compromise, and BAN ALL pop culture mentions in aircraft article, PERIOD/FULLSTOP! I've found it's alot easier to explain to teenage and &quot;adult&quot; gamers that no pop culture items are allowed, than to explain why such-and-such movie is in the list, but ''their'' favorite game or cartoon is not. I've even had to explain this to someone who interpreted a section to mean &quot;all movies&quot; are notable, but games are not! 
*Having now experienced a taste of this, I would be inclined to support the ban of all &quot;pop culture&quot; references, rather than have something inaccurate presented as fact.[[User:Happysomeone|Happysomeone]] 17:50, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

== Criticism ==

There really needs to be a separate section on criticism of this program, as criticism is coming from both sides of the political aisle, unlike earlier fighter programs. The main point should be the argument in politics on whether the aircraft is necessary at all. This is the first fighter program in modern history that I can recall that has had significant criticism from Republicans as well as Democrats. Then you've got the price issue, the limited quantities that the issue forces, and the already-noted quality issues. This is an aircraft that's been in development since the late 80's, and still doesn't have the bugs worked out. Some of that is because of redesign issues, but that should be part of the criticism argument as well. [[User:DesScorp|DesScorp]] 03:57, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

Apparently, LM has known about these problems for a decade. There's also the ongoing issue of the massive cost of the plane, which the article largely ignores. The article also ignores the question of whether the plane is relevant, or even just the best solution to the Air Force's needs. In short, the article violates the Wikipedia NPV policy.

GAO-01-310 (2001) Tactical Aircraft:

(read e.g. 25-26) - &quot; the Air Force estimates that by the end of development, the F-22 will be able to complete 2 flying hours between maintenance actions; and when the F-22 reaches maturity in 2008, F-22s will be able to complete 3 flying hours between maintenance actions. However, currently the flight-test aircraft are completing 0.6 flying hours between maintenance actions. This means that aircraft are now requiring significantly more maintenance than is expected when the system reaches maturity.&quot;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01310.pdf]

This source from 2001, believe the F-22 will be &quot;able to complete 3 flying hours between maintenance actions&quot; in 2008, but still in 2007 - 6 years later - the F-22 still cant even complete 1 flying hour between maintenance actions. Read page 87-88 in adope pages, in GAO report 2007 - &quot;Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs&quot; - GAO-07-406SP: &quot;A key reliability requirement for the F-22A is a
3-hour mean time between maintenance, defined as the number of operating hours divided by the number of maintenance actions.

'''Currently the mean time between maintenance is less than 1 hour''', or half of what was expected at the end of system development&quot; [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07406sp.pdf]

.....and yes the &quot;100,000 operational flying hours&quot; is pushed into the future in every report, because the F-22 have soomany bugs, it has less flying hours.

&quot;As stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars we must assure the public that we are buying the best programs for our servicemen and women at the best price for the taxpayer.

&quot;The reason for this is quite simple. '''First, it does not take an economics degree to understand that the higher that costs of a weapon system unexpectedly goes up, the fewer of them we can buy. A prime example is the F-22 Raptor.

== The real price of the F-22 ==

Why is the price of the F-22 not correct? Are you simple not aware of the real price or do you try to manipulate it?

The F-22's are bought in smaller quantities at different years at different prices, but all in multiyear contracts, so if i wanted to, i could find you a price on over $200 million also excluding the R&amp;D cost. It seems someone looked for the lowest prce in the USAF budget estimates and picked it, why? Are you not aware the average price of an F-22 is around $185 million? Or do you just pick $135 here on the wiki fanpage to make the F-22 look better? 

you want sources? 

'''Congressional reseach service (CRS) for Congress on June 12, 2007, page 7:'''

&quot;The F-22A's average procurement unit cost is estimated at approximately $185.4 million per aircraft&quot;

'''Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before the Subcommittee on AirLand Committee on Armed Services United States Senate on July 25, 2006, page 2:''' 

&quot;However, because the F-22A has turned out to be much more expensive than other fighter aircraft— procuring 182 aircraft will cost an average of $185 million per plane&quot; 

http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/74xx/doc7424/07-25-F-22.pdf

'''U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) before Subcommittee on Defense, House of Representatives June 20, 2006 , page 5:'''  

&quot;In other words, the unit procurement costs increase from $166 million per aircraft to $183 million per aircraft for the proposed multiyear contract.&quot;

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06455r.pdf

Congress says $185 million is the average price for the F-22, but F-22 fans here on wiki says 135, based on budget estimates picked for one year out of a multi year contract

Its part of a multi year contract, if the average price of the F-22 is 185, and lets the the USAF needs two F-22's spread over 2 years, you could pay $185 million for one F-22 each year, or you could pay $369 million for one F-22 the first year and $1 million the next year, it wont matter, since the average price is still 185 (leaving out NPV calculation). The problem first exist when socalled moods here on WIKI start to use the $1 million dollar (paid in year two) as pricetag for the F-22, based on budget estimates from USAF. 

Using the average unit procurement costs as U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and Congressional reseach service (CRS) will prevent manipulation/mistakes as here on wiki. So in short, either you should show all the different prices for each year and each quantity, or you should use the average cost as US Congress does. What WIKI does it a mistake, whether made on purpose or with intent, I cant say, but readers should not trust what they read in this F-22 article.--[[User:Financialmodel|Financialmodel]] ([[User talk:Financialmodel|talk]]) 17:21, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

* The Infobox lists the flyaway cost of $137.7M and the total program cost of $62B per [[WP:Air/PC]] guidelines.  The article goes on to state these costs and lists two average unit costs of over $330M.  The decrease in number from 750 to 183 is also covered (see Procurement section).  No cost info is being hidden. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 01:00, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

*Allow me to include the average &quot;UPC&quot; (unit procurement costs) and &quot;PUAC&quot; (program unit acquisition cost) also, as stated by the US Goverment accountaibility office (GAO), Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Congressional reseach service (CRS), it's no secret USAF have always been in the buttom price range. It can only improve the facts in this article, since picking prices for different years in a multi-year contract makes no sence. E.g. look at the pricetag in the USAF budget estimates for the first 92 F-22's bought, look at how many active F-22's this article claim there is, and now look at the price you have picked for a quantity of 21 f-22's in a specific year, it makes no sence. I see it as cherrypicking, but i dont plan to start a longer discussion as long as you also include the average UPC and PAUC as descriped by GAO, CBO and CRS.

:::Here we go again. Why do you insist on adding irrelevant information to entries? There is a very good reason to only list unit flyaway cost and total program cost. They can be applied to all military aircraft no matter origin irregardless of accounting practices. By giging those two costs you can also gauge how the size of the production run affects overall out of pocket expenses. Lastly, surely you must agree that when using these prices the most current data should be used. Imagine what would happen if we did not. given the very good chance that the USAF will wind up buying close to 400 F-22s we could use the projected unit cost for a 24 plane production run in 2013 and come up with a flyaway cost less than $100mil.

OF all the 91 active F-22's the pricetag is 168 million USD, but you F_22 fans want to make it look cheaper, and since 91 are bought at 168, and then prices are lowered, because its always best to get a large amount up front, read NPV. You refuse to use average because 92 F-22's at 168 million have a hig weitht, instead you use a pricetag for 21 F-22s, not even active yet, but which will make the Fly away cost for the F-22 seem cheaper, its part of a multiyear conctract, and this source is only budget estimates for the financial payment, not the cost of the fly away cost of the F-22 as such, do averages.

::*Mythsearcher said: Should I remind you that the cost per unit will change accordingly due to material price change throughout time, inflation and technological advancement?

With inflation price increases, and as you can see this is not the case here, your source is a &quot;budget&quot; that show the different payments in a multiyear contract, and it has nothing to do with the cost of an F-22. Spin it as you want, the F-22's price sudently got cheaper from the payment of 168 million for the first 92 F-22's, to 135 million USD for the next 21 F-22's the next year. It's not &quot;due to material price change throughout time&quot; or &quot;inflation&quot;, it's finance 101, you want as much money in as soon as possible, because the Net Present Value is bigger. Right now this article hide this. Article says 91 active F-22's, and we know the first 92 F-22's cost 168 million USD, and yet we use the pricetag from a much smaller quantity of 21, that is '''the payment for the delivery of raptor number 114 to 134'''.

The cost overruns of the F-22 project are huge, but is it mentioned? Read GAO to US Congress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Summary:

'''Based on our review, in our opinion, the DOD has not demonstrated the need or value for making further investments in the F-22A program. The Air Force’s current stated “need” is for 381 F-22As to satisfy air-to-air missions and recently added requirements for more robust ground attack and intelligence-gathering capabilities. However, because of past cost overruns and current budget constraints, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) states that it can now afford only 183 F-22As. This leaves a 198-aircraft gap between the Air Force’s stated need and what is currently affordable'''[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06455r.pdf]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

.....The USAF want to buy 381 F-22's, which they say is needed as a minimum, but because of the huge cost overruns of this project, they can only afford 183, leaving a 198-aircraft gap between the Air Force’s stated need and what is currently affordable, is this conflict presented in the article? No. Instead its presented in a way, that dosent discuss the huge cost overruns of this project, read &quot;Procurement&quot; section, that just run over the numbers as headlines. It dont mention the current conflict where less F-22's are bought than what USAF state is needed, and it dont state why. Instead the article goes on, to speak about the benefits of buying more F-22's eventhought its limit is cut, because it cost too much. The article tells about how cheap this can be done by using fly-away cost, which has nothing to do which the real price, Congress pays, which is why all sources to Congress use UPC, the numbers certain editors refuse to even mention here in the start of article. Read article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;If the Air Force were to buy 100 more F-22s today, the cost of each one would be less than $117 million and would continue to drop with additional aircraft purchases [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123022371 &quot;F-22 excels at establishing air dominance.&quot; USAF ]. + F-22 is not the most expensive aircraft&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In short, this article sounds almost like a '''marketing campain from USAF''' on the great benefits of more F-22's, and no mention on its the huge cost overruns that is to blame for the low numbers, and there is refusal to present the real cost paid by US Congress, average UPC.

And this is what critics tell you again and again, something not mentioned here either, read:

Senator John McCain, &quot;McCAIN INTRODUCES THE DEFENSE ACQUISTION REFORM ACT OF 2007&quot;, May 22, 2007: 

&quot;As stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars we must assure the public that we are buying the best programs for our servicemen and women at the best price for the taxpayer. I have already highlighted critical weapon systems with key acquisition problems. If we continue to buy weapon systems in an ineffective and inefficient manner so that costs continue to go up or the deployment of the system is delayed, it will only hurt the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine in the field.

&quot;The reason for this is quite simple. '''First, it does not take an economics degree to understand that the higher that costs of a weapon system unexpectedly goes up, the fewer of them we can buy. A prime example is the F-22 Raptor. The original requirement was for 781 jet fighters, now we can only afford 183.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt; [http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:0Xq7T9_y5UwJ:mccain.senate.gov/press_office/view_article.cfm%3FID%3D1086+A+prime+example+is+the+F-22+Raptor.+The+original+requirement+was+for+781+jet+fighters&amp;hl=da&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1]

LOL, how stupid are you allowed to be? 
So you want me to find a soure saying the original research done here isnt correct. Ask any economist if there is a difference in unit cost and budget payments (here budgt estimates), and they will tell you there is. Here on wiki you somehow use budget estimates at evidence of the unit cost, which is true original research. Find a source that validates the numbers you picked out of the thin air. You picked certain payments from a multiyear contract with lowest price tag in 2007 to make the F-22 look cheap, none of you even bother to change the price of the F-22 to 2008 payments, since budget payments per unit is now higher. Its bias and should be seen by even a elementary schoolgrader, no economist use budgetpayments in single years from multiyear contracts, to state the unit price. You claim I argue for original research, but facts are you moods have made your own sources out of the thin air - just look at the written sources i gave 3 congress agencies. Now stop wasting my time making up shit, and correct this price to real numbers. If you want to continue your bias cherrypicking numbers in single years, at least pick 2008 numbers in you budget estimates. we have 91 active f-22's and the price of these are badly manipulated. I know why people refer to wiki as a shitty source, even whn confronted with bias here, sources are not corrected and all one can do is to repeat yourself.--[[User:Financialmodel|Financialmodel]] ([[User talk:Financialmodel|talk]]) 18:58, 20 January 2008 (UTC)

** [[WP:TE|Tendentious editing]]. From the Wikipedia guideline on tendentious editing, here are some of the characteristics of &quot;issue&quot; editors:

I would have to say so. Financialmodel has an axe to grind here and the other 2 articles in dispute. As stated elsewhere in this talk page, s/he has been posting essentially the same arguments over and over in wordy diatribes about how the editors here are in some sort of cabal aimed against any sort of criticism; this is hardly the case. There ''is'' criticism of the plane; it's just not in a section dedicated to criticism (which I believe is discouraged anyway; the relevant negative points should ''always'' go right after the positive points they dispute, not separated). IMHO, the cost issue is explained pretty clearly in the article; there isn't any hiding of costs, nor is there figure cherrypicking. The flyaway cost for the current contract is 137 million; that's a fact, and the most current fact, regardless of the average cost of the entire production run (which is, in fact, stated in the article as well). [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 15:42, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

:Outsider Comments:  Upon reading this entire bloody talk page,(all I can say about the general tone is 'my god, you're all adults?  no way!')  I feel fairly obligated to interject a few observations here.
:
:1.) It appears that while Financialmodel is not operating in the best possible way, it also appears that his grasp of the English language is also less than complete, suggesting he's probably not a native speaker.  There is some suggestion of bias on his part, but he does raise a somewhat valid point...once you translate it and get past the personal attacks.  Also, people blowing him off because of his poor English looks fairly bad from the outside.
:2.) Most of the editors responding to him seem to be missing what seems to be his primary point.  He's been talking the entire time about the LISTBOX at the top right of the page, not the content of the article.  He feels, a bit strongly, that it's incomplete, and points out that given that the 'unit cost' appears to have been arbitrarily selected from a list of values, it's somewhat suspicious that the value selected was one of the lowest ones available from any kind of official source(though theoretically the most current).
:3.) 'Unit Cost' does, at first glance, sound like 'how much they cost each', whereas 'flyaway cost' is not even mentioned as well as being a sufficiently arcane term that the layman will probably not understand it without further reading.  Requiring the reader to divide the program cost by the number of articles to get the actual total average price per unit is a bit much, especially as most readers will probably assume that the 'unit cost' is such a thing and not investigate further.
:4.) Financialmodel appears to be attempting to call for arbitration, which is getting shoved to the side and ignored.  This appears to be because the other editors involved have concluded that because of his methods(in particular the conspiracy accusations and unwarranted personal attacks), that he is not worth listening to and cannot be making a valid point.
:5.) I absolutely agree with him that the listbox info does seem somewhat deceptive, and quite possibly not adequately described.  'Flyaway Cost' should probably be a separate entry from 'Unit Cost', as it appears that 'Flyaway cost' is not what the average reader is going to be expecting to be listed as the 'unit cost'.  By all means include it, but it does seem deceptive the way it's set up now.
:
:In short, it doesn't look like anything halfway as malicious as what Financial is saying it is, but there is a bit of a problem.  'Current Flyaway Cost' is all well and great, but it's not what the average reader is probably going to be expecting to be given for 'unit cost'.  Perhaps 'Average unit cost' reflecting the program costs, and 'Current unit cost' reflecting the current flyaway costs?  or something similar, removing the 'do the math yourself' requirement from the reader, as well as adding information and transparency to the summary section of the article(which is, I might add, all most people are going to read). -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.80|66.42.151.80]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.80|talk]]) 22:18, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
::As one of the quasi-adults, let me put something else into context, this editor has been &quot;campaigning&quot; in three different articles, against the consensus views of other editors, to institute a POV that supports his contention that the Eurofighter Tyhoon is superior to other contemporary fighters. The &quot;flyaway&quot; costs are a canard that he has instituted on this page, on the [[4th generation jet fighter]] page, he attempted to introduce comparative analysis based on unverifiable exercise reports while in the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] article he introduced a copviol that was misquoted but again was a wholly unsupportable document based on hearsay. So, in short, your analysis does not take into consideration the disruptive tendentious editing pattern that was instilled.

:::No, he's not operating in good faith, no he's not operating reasonably, yes it was initiated as a retalation...  But that's all his problem, and will result in consequences if it continues.
:::And frankly, that's why you need the outsider viewpoint right now.  You've gotten yourselves so riled up because of his methods, and it frankly looks like it's also partially because he's presenting a different viewpoint you don't agree with, that you're just discarding everything he says out of hand without even stopping to consider that he could possibly have a point.  We're supposed to be neutral and rational and I'm not seeing much of that here.
:::
:::Quite simply, 'unit cost' and 'flyaway cost' are not the same thing, and it is not what the majority of the readers are going to be expecting.  They're going to look and say 'oh so they cost 137 million each, so why are people talking like it was 200 million plus?' and close the article.  Regardless of what else he has done, that much is true and no amount of posturing about his bad faith attacks will make it any less true or relevant.
:::
:::Finally, I have to add that stooping to his level in response to his attacks is not what wikipedia needs.  We would all be better served if everyone involved in such disputes took a step back, examined what was actually being said, and considered it rationally and calmly.  If that had been done here a lot of nonsense from all parties could've been avoided very easily, and his 'attack' would've been pretty well staved off.  Ever heard the expression 'don't feed the troll'?  Well that's what happened here.  He trolled in response to stuff elsewhere, and rather than looking at it rationally and easily defusing it, it was escalated further to an absurd point.  It takes two to have an argument.  Better to make him look like the idiot he is by pulling the rug out from under him by operating in good faith even when he doesn't. -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.80|66.42.151.80]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.80|talk]]) 22:56, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

::Flyaway cost is not some useless thing.  It is what the aircraft would cost now for a new order.

If a different cost was used for different articles, then that would of couse open up a huge can of worms, and likely lead to much bigger edit wars than we've gt at the moment.  While it may be better to use a better title - this is part of the infobox template and changing it may be problematical - perhaps the fact that it is flyaway cost could be explained as a footnote?[[User:Nigel Ish|Nigel Ish]] ([[User talk:Nigel Ish|talk]]) 23:22, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
::J, That's a good idea and can be incorporated either in the form of an &quot;invisible&quot; or as a footnote (or expanded note, or asterix note) so that everyone can see it. I don't see the need for it in every article but it certainly could apply here. FWIW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 00:02, 21 December 2007 (UTC).
:::Yes, as I said, there's a very good rationale for including it, and it is indeed useful information.  Some clarification of what the number refers to wouldn't hurt a bit, and would make things much more clear for the average reader that isn't going to go digging into talk pages and such to find out the details of it.  I personally tend to think that including BOTH the Flyaway and Average Per Unit cost over the lifetime of the program in the infobox is the best way to go, but it's a bit harder to accomplish than just adding an explanatory footnote.  The two figures are different, but both relevant in different contexts.  Flyaway cost references how much an individual unit costs to procure at the moment, whereas average unit cost would be the average cost per plane of the entire program.  The former is more relevant to additional procurement, while the latter is more relevant to the controversy about the cost of the program.  Clarifying with a footnote of some kind is an excellent temporary solution however. :)
:::Trick here is that most users reading this article that have heard about all the controversies about how expensive it is are going to be looking for cost information, and there's a fair chance they're going to skim most of the article, if they even bother to so much as glance at anything outside the infobox and the summary.  And a lot of them are going to be expecting the development, manufacturing, testing costs etc. to be included.  As I said, the problem isn't so much what figure we're using, as that it's labeled unclearly and takes more effort to find out what it is than most readers are going to put in to it.  The net result of which is that anyone that just glances at it comes away with the incomplete although correct impression that the plane is cheaper than all the reps in congress fussing about it let on.
:::Another problem with that one, is that if someone reads in the paper that the per unit cost is $185 million US, and sees here that it's $137 million US, and doesn't realize the two figures are different, there is the chance they could conclude the figure here is wrong.  If they're bold they'll try to change it(which from some of the comments and the page protection sounds like it may have occurred here), if they're not they'll probably just conclude that it's 'yet another example of wikipedia being inaccurate'.  Which is part of why I tend to prefer more information, clearly labeled, rather than less.  Especially where it prevents confusion or inaccurate impressions. -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.80|66.42.151.80]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.80|talk]]) 01:30, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

::::::I am glad that [[User_talk:66.42.151.80|Graptor]] is attempting to introduce some clear-headed debate into this folderol.  However, I’m afraid he and others have misconstrued “flyaway cost” and “unit cost” as separate things; this isn’t necessarily.  [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] was kind enough to post a link to my [[User:Askari Mark/Understanding aircraft unit costs|essay]] explaining the confusing hodgepodge of costs quoted for military aircraft; since I wrote it to help editors avoid such fracases as these, I would encourage everybody involved to read it.  As I pointed out there, a “unit” cost is simply the indicated type of cost divided by the number of aircraft being paid for (i.e., the &quot;per airplane&quot; cost). In some cases, the reported cost is normally a unit cost; e.g., “flyaway cost” (FAC) and “unit flyaway cost” (UFAC) are the same thing, so use of the term “unit” is actually rather superfluous.  On the other hand, some types of costs need that clarification.  “Program cost” (or “procurement cost” or “production cost”) is usually taken to be the ''total'' program cost – unless it is specified as a “''unit'' program cost” (UPC).

::::::My advice has been – and WP:AIR prescribes – the use of FAC and/or UPC costs for infoboxes.  Why?  Because they’re the only kinds of costs that are usually readily available or calculable for almost all aircraft and they’re in line with what the average reader thinks of as “the airplane’s” rough cost.  Should we list every possible kind of cost in the infobox?  No.  It’s only supposed to provide highlights and comparable information across all aircraft.  If “program acquisition costs” (PAC) were widely available, then it would make sense to include them as well.  However, pretty much only the USA publishes such costs and not even for all of its aircraft.  They are appropriate, though, for inclusion in the main text, where their significance can be explained to the general reader.  Is there a good reason to ''not'' include PAC in the infobox?  Yes, there is.  It is because people who have an inimical POV to push like to (mis)use it for their own political agenda, as I noted in my essay.  Since you can’t explain it in an infobox, it really shouldn’t be there.  If anything, having an estimated total program cost is fine ... but just how much “stuff” needs to be in an infobox?  I hope this helps to better clarify the matter for the editors at debate here.

== Cockpit ==

I propose adding a new sub-secton, immedaitely after Avionics, entitled &quot;Cockpit&quot;, with suitable references, using some or all of the following information:

===Cockpit===

====Overview====
The cockpit was one of the first so-called “glass-cockpits” without traditional round dials, standby or dedicated gauges and represents a marked improvement on the cockpit design of previous jets.
====Start Up====
There are only three steps to take the F-22 from cold to full readiness for takeoff: the pilot places the battery switch 'on,' places the auxiliary power unit switch momentarily to 'start' and then places both throttles in 'idle.' The engines start sequentially right to left and the auxiliary power unit automatically shuts down. All subsystems and avionics are brought on line and built-in testis are made.  Navigation information and pilot's personal avionics preferences are loaded automatically. The airplane can be ready to taxi in less than 30 seconds after engine start. 
====HMI====
The GEC-built monochrome Head-Up Display ([[HUD]]) offers a wide field of view (30  horizontal, 25 vertically) and serves as a primary flight instrument for the pilot. The HUD is approximately 4.5 inches tall with standardized symbology compatible with that used head down. 
The HUD is planned to also have a rubber buffer strip on it that will effectively shield the polycarbonate of the canopy when it flexes during a bird-strike and should prevent it shattering. Design is also underway for a HUD that will collapse during a bird-strike.
The Integrated Control Panel (ICP) is the primary means for manual pilot entry of communications, navigation, and autopilot data. Located under the glare shield and HUD in the upper centre the instrument panel, this keypad entry system also has some double click functions, much like a computer mouse for rapid pilot access/use. 
There are six liquid crystal display ([[LCD]]) panels in the cockpit. These present information in full colour, are fully readable in direct sunlight and offer less weight and size than traditional [[CRT]] displays. Two Up-Front Displays (UFDs) (3&quot;x4&quot;) located to the left and right of the ICP are used to display Integrated Caution/ Advisory/ Warning (ICAW) data, communications/ navigation/ identification (CNI) data and also serve as the Stand-by Flight instrumentation Group and Fuel Quantity Indicator (SFG/FQI). 
The Stand-by Flight Group also presented on LCD, shows basic information, such as artificial horizon, needed to fly the aircraft in [[IMC]]. The SFG is tied to the last source of power in the aircraft, so if everything else fails, the pilot will still be able to fly the aircraft. 
The colour Primary Multi-Function Display (PMFD) (8&quot;x8&quot;) is located in the middle of the instrument panel, under the ICP. It is the pilot's principal display for aircraft navigation (including waypoints and route of flight) and Situation Assessment (SA).
Three Secondary Multi-Function Displays (SMFDs) (6.25&quot; x 6.25&quot;) are located on either side of the PMFD and under the PMFD between the pilot's knees. These are used for displaying tactical (both offensive and defensive) information as well as non-tactical information (such as checklists, subsystem status, engine thrust output, and stores management). 
====Integrated Caution, Advisory and Warning System (ICAW)==== 
To reduce pilot workload in flight, the uniquely designed integrated caution, advisory and warning system (ICAW) can display a total of 12 individual ICAW messages at one time on the up-front display and additional ones can appear on sub pages of the display. 
All ICAW fault messages are filtered to eliminate extraneous messages and tell the pilot specifically and succinctly what the problem is. For example, when an engine fails, the generator and hydraulic cautions normally associated with an engine being shutdown are suppressed, and the pilot is provided the specific problem in the form of an engine shutdown message.  ICAW also incorporates an electronic checklist.
If multiple ICAWs occur, their associated checklists are selected by moving a pick box over the desired ICAW and depressing the checklist button. Associated checklists are automatically linked together. 
====Cockpit Display Symbology ====
Enemy aircraft are shown as red triangles, friendly aircraft as green circles, unknown aircraft as yellow squares, and wingmen are shown as blue. Surface-to-air missile sites are represented by pentagons, along with an indication of missile type and its lethal range. An in-filled triangle means that the pilot has a missile firing-quality solution against that target. The pilot has a cursor on each screen, and he can use this to request ask extra information more information.
The Inter/Intra Flight Data Link (IFDL) allows a number of F-22 to be linked together to trade information without radio calls with each F-22s in a flight or between flights.
====Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS)====
The F-22 features a side-stick controller (like an F-16) and two throttles that are the aircraft's primary flight controls. The GEC-built stick is located on the right console with a swing-out, adjustable arm rest. The stick is force sensitive and moves only about one-quarter of an inch. The throttles are located on the left console. HOTAS switches, both shape and texture coded, are used to control more than 60 different time-critical functions.
====Accommodation====
The cockpit accommodates the 0.5 to 99.5 percentile, i.e. the body size of the central 99% of the U.S. Air Force pilot population. This represents the largest range of pilots accommodated by any tactical aircraft now in service. The rudder pedals are adjustable. The pilot has 15-degree over-the-nose visibility as well as excellent over-the-side and aft visibility. 
====Lighting====
The cockpit interior lighting is fully Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible, as is the exterior lighting. The cockpit panels feature extended life, self-balancing, electro-luminescent (EL) edge-lit panels with an integral life-limiting circuit. 
====Life Support==== 
The F-22 life support system integrates all critical components of clothing, protective gear, and aircraft equipment necessary to sustain the pilot's life while flying the aircraft. In the past, these components had been designed and produced separately. These include: 
	An on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) that supplies breathable air to the pilot. 
	An integrated breathing regulator/anti-g valve (BRAG) that controls flow and pressure to the mask and pressure garments. 
	A chemical/biological/cold-water immersion (CB/CWI) protection ensemble. 
	An upper body counter pressure garment and a lower body anti-G garment acts a partial pressure suit at high altitudes. 
	An air-cooling garment, also to be used by pilots on the Army's RAH-66 Comanche helicopter providing thermal relief for the pilot. 
	Helmet and helmet-mounted systems including C/B goggles and C/B hood; and the MBU-22/P breathing mask and hose system. 
Escape-system tests have proven the life-support system to wind speeds of up to 600 knots. Current life-support systems are designed to provide protection only up to 450 knots. 
The head mounted portions of the life-support system are approximately 30 percent lighter than existing systems, which improves mobility and endurance time for pilots. With its advanced design, the HGU-86/P helmet that will be used by F-22 pilots during EMD reduces the stresses on a pilot's neck by 20 percent during high-speed ejection compared to the current HGU-55/P helmets. The F-22 helmet fits more securely as the result of an ear cup tensioning device and is easily fitted to a pilot's head. The helmet provides improved passive noise protection and incorporates an Active Noise Reduction (ANR) system for superior pilot protection. 
The chemical/biological/cold water immersion clothing meets or exceeds Air Force requirements and fit a wider range of sizes and body shapes (the central 99%). 
====Canopy==== 
The canopy is approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, 27 inches tall, and weighs approximately 360 pounds. It is a rotate/translate design, i.e. comes down, slides forward, and locks in place with pins. 
The canopy's transparency (by Sierracin) features the largest piece of monolithic polycarbonate material being formed today. It has no canopy bow and offers the pilot superior optics (Zone 1 quality) throughout (not just in the area near the HUD) and offers the requisite stealth features. 
The canopy is resistant to chemical/biological and environmental agents, and has been successfully tested to withstand the impact of a four-pound bird at 350 knots. It also protects the pilot from lightning strikes. 
The 3/4&quot; polycarbonate transparency is actually made of two 3/8&quot; thick sheets that are heated and fusion bonded, with the sheets melding to become a single-piece and then drape forged, i.e. no laminate as in the F-16. Post-ejection canopy-seat-pilot collision has been designed out as the framed canopy weighs slightly more on one side than the other slices nearly ninety degrees to the right as it clears the aircraft. 
====ACES II Ejection Seat ====
The Ejection Seat is an improved version of the ACES II (Advanced Concept Ejection Seat) used in nearly every other U.S.A.F. jet combat aircraft, with a centre mounted ejection control. Improvements over the previous seat models include: 
- An active arm restraint system to eliminate arm flail injuries during high speed ejections. 
- An improved fast-acting seat stabilization drogue parachute system to provide increased seat stability and safety, located behind the pilot's head and is mortar-deployed. 
- A new electronic seat and aircraft sequencing system that improves the timing of the ejection event sequence.
- A larger oxygen bottle providing more breathing air to support ejection at higher altitudes (if required). 
The system utilizes the standard analogue three-mode seat sequencer that automatically senses the seat speed and altitude, and then selects the proper mode for optimum seat performance.

The price used in this article is based on original research, and false research that it. I wanted to correct this but was prevented, also i wanted to improve the cost section with UPC and unit program cost, so readers see what is what, with refference to what the difference is, but this too is prevented, eventhough we have clarl numbers fom 3 US congress agencies. In short, stop original research in fly away cost, which is manipulated numbers cherrypicked for small quantities with low pricetags in a multiyear contract. Using single year budget estimates in multiyear contract as source for the real price is something no economist would ever do. the 20 f-22's you picked the pricetag of isnt even active yet. --[[User:Financialmodel|Financialmodel]] ([[User talk:Financialmodel|talk]]) 20:11, 20 January 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, it is resolved.  Consensus has been reached; it need not be unanimous.  The fact that you couldn’t sway consensus to your cherry-picked highest-number-ever-reported price for the F-22 does not make the officially released numbers “original research” or “false research”; it just simply doesn’t suit the objective of your personal POV campaign.  For someone who styles himself “FinancialModel”, you seem to possess little knowledge of commercial economics in general or US budget processes specifically.  If you did, you would not make so many absurd statements and claims (such as mistaking “UPC” – the abbreviation for “Unit Program Cost” – as two different things).  

:Any budget analyst familiar with the aerospace industry would be surprised to hear that “flyaway cost” is “original research”; rather, they would recognize it as a very traditional type of cost (that had been around and used for decades before UPCs came into use).  They also understand that airplanes don’t have just one cost, but a range of different costs, each including different things and used for different purposes – and they appreciate that only the same types of costs should be used in comparisons.  Any professional economist is well aware of the “bath tub effect” in the production costs of manufactured items:  As production ramps up, production teams advance up their learning curves, and production rates approach the most economically efficient production rate, the cost initially drops, then stabilizes for a long period, until production begins tapering off at the end of the product’s life, when costs rise as production rates move away from the optimum.  You might be surprised to learn that economists ''actually do'' consider the latest price to ''be the most accurate current price'' of a commodity, and use it in preference to prices of several years previously.  They also understand that the whole purpose of a multi-year contract is to stabilize production for lower cost to the producer and a lower price for the buyer – and that that’s considered a good thing.  This is all Econ 101, really.  It's a new year, so why don't you please resolve to put aside the disruptive trolling and try to be a constructive editor instead?

::Just don't forget that the majority of people that read the article are neither budget analysts nor familiar with the aerospace industry; not to mention disinclined to read six articles just to understand one.  Articles being difficult to understand was one of the things the Nature review of wikipedia found as a flaw.  Articles, or large parts of them, are all too often written by experts in a way that assumes an advanced understand of the general topic, and requires one to decipher; particularly the science articles.  Just try to keep in mind how the things in the article look to someone that doesn't have all that specialized knowledge.  If it's all written with that one thing in mind, these sorts of problems will be a lot harder to push.

:Hate to poke in again, but after some thought, and finding some articles in the WP namespace that I hadn't seen before, I feel more than a little compelled to do so.  I think I can more clearly explain what I was trying to say back in December now.  I gather the controversy has largely been resolved, but I know that I can sometimes be less than clear in getting things across, and was apparently so in this case.  
:First a couple minor, but relevant, personal details.  I'm a huge fan of the F-22.  Have been ever since I heard about the thing.  I've been using the nick 'Graptor' since 1998, a personalized version of 'Raptor', a term I've had something of a fascination with since I first heard it.  When the F-22 got named 'Raptor' it was already my favorite aircraft, bar none, but that was one hell of a bonus.  I'd give damn near anything to fly one of the things, impossible though that may be.  
:Thing is though, it's a surprisingly controversial aircraft.  Specifically the US Congress decided they didn't like the amount of money being spent on it, and wanted to cut it, but at that point the only way to cut it was to cut procurement.  Which they did.  Repeatedly.  It's such a controversial topic that it's actually managed to creep into the mainstream media from time to time, with the issue of costs always coming up.  Nearly always a cost-per-aircraft is cited, most recently generally in the neighborhood of $185 million, though in some cases as a derivative of the total program cost divided over the number of aircraft, a figure which goes up dramatically with lessened procurement.
:Wikipedia for, as far as I can determine, completely valid reasons, uses the 'flyaway cost', which is, as I've gathered from the comments available, simply what it would cost if you went to Lockheed Martin/Boeing and wanted to buy one right off the line, with all the startup and development costs excluded.  This figure is far lower than generally quoted figures, in particular as regards the controversial issue: the perceived high cost of the program as related to the number of aircraft acquired.
:The problem is in fact pretty much specific to this one aircraft as far as the cost goes, and exclusively because of the controversy involved.  Laypeople who hear of the controversy may very well come to wikipedia looking for more information.  To such a person, the fact that flyaway cost was being used wasn't apparent, what 'flyaway cost' referred to is/was not readily apparent, and perhaps most importantly, the reason the flyaway cost differs so drastically from the figures often quoted by the opponents of additional procurement isn't readily apparent either.  Combined they could serve to produce more edit wars(well meaning users changing 'unit cost' to what they think is the 'right' number based on other sources, not understanding why flyaway cost is used), a general confusion among people seeking information on that topic(particularly if they don't read further into the article.  Many of them will probably be looking for confimation of a figure only and not more in-depth information), and perhaps worst of all, lead some to conclude that wikipedia is simply wrong.
:I have a sneaking suspicion that the issue regarding the procurement and costs of the F-22 is far from dead.  The US Air Force has never been happy with the number of aircraft congress has authorized, and the recent discovery of structural problems in at least part of the F-15 fleet could very well bring it right back to the fore.  If it does end up being used as an argument for increased procurement of the F-22 to replace, rather than supplement, the F-15 fleet(as was intended by the Air Force all along!), it's all too likely the ensuing discussion will drive even more people to this article, and all the more important that it be clear to those people.
:It was once said that there are three kinds of lies.  Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics.  The whole controversy over the cost contains massive amounts of the latter, and it being a substantial issue that's dogged this aircraft for many, many years, I tend to think it requires some extra effort to make very clear, to the layman specifically seeking such information, what the actual numbers involved actually are within the article itself.  Flyaway cost is a great, useful addition, particularly for an infobox.  It just needs to be clear to some random person reading the article that is flyaway cost(achieved! yay!), what specifically 'flyaway cost' refers to, and how it relates to the other numbers they'd have heard tossed around so they can understand why it's so much lower.

::I found the procurement section very clear on the cost of the F - 22, it clearly states the current cost, and why the cost is so high. However, I would change the unit cost in the blue box at the top to a current unit cost at 339 million, and an additional unit cost at 137.5 million. This would clarify the difference to the casual observer. [[User:TwistedWeasel|TwistedWeasel]] ([[User talk:TwistedWeasel|talk]]) 15:26, 21 March 2008 (UTC)


== Lead paragraphs ==

I am requesting a discussion to fend off an edit-revert &quot;conflab.&quot; I had placed the paragraph in this section as it provided a general statement regarding the capability of the F-22. I also consider the edit a &quot;good faith&quot; edit which necessitates other editors to alter or revise but not to outright revert the passage unless it contravenes MoS or other stipulations. The discussions on this page do not specifically address the issue. Read [[Help:Reverting]], For your convenience:
* Reverting is a decision which should be taken seriously.
* Reverting is used primarily for fighting vandalism &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism&gt; , or anything very similar to the effects of vandalism &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism&gt; .

If you are not sure whether a revert is appropriate, discuss it first rather than immediately reverting or deleting it. If you feel the edit is unsatisfactory, improve it rather than simply reverting or deleting it. FWIW [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] ([[User talk:Bzuk|talk]]) 02:52, 5 January 2008 (UTC).

* The comparison paragraph in the lead was part of the Comparisions section that we decided to remove in October.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F-22_Raptor&amp;diff=166507297&amp;oldid=166506668 Oct. 23 version].  Some could say it falls under that consensus or does not.  I think the paragraph should be moved to the Design section or just removed.  -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 03:58, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

**I think that the USAF and a fairly current high ranking RAAF officer are sufficient sources to include this on the basis of notability by recognized experts in the field. Obviously the &quot;best&quot; is going to be somewhat subjective. That however is not the point of including it in here. I think the real reason why it needs to be included is to put in context why the USAF is willing to pay upwards of 130M for each copy. I think how the air force and other experts aside from the manufacturer view the aircraft and the importance of the ability in their eyes at least to dominate the skies is very much relevant. While it may not belong in the lead paragraph I do think it is important enough to include it somewhere. Last, I was not the one who put it there originally.

:Actually, the opinion of, say, engineers would matter. The opinion of military officers on engineering design is not worth much. If only because &quot;best&quot; means nothing. Is it the fastest plane? Has it the longer range? Is it the stealthiest? Is its design so good that vast quantities for absurdly low price were produced? Etc.

::Cyrille, I see your point, these are pretty &quot;broad&quot; statements and even though they are sourced, are subject to controversy. The reason for my moving the passage up into the &quot;lead&quot; was that it seemed to be a defining statement of the purpose of the aircraft, ie. as an &quot;air superiority&quot; weapons system. I certainly am open to suggestions as to what to do with the statements and if the consensus is to alter, revise, reposition or even redact or remove them them, so be it; my main contention in initiating this discussion &quot;string&quot; is to engage discourse as well as stymie an edit/revert war.

== F-22 in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem ==

I'm unsure whether adding info in the pop culture section is necessary, but it does raise something interesting. In the film, the F-22 drops a nuclear bomb which is not fitted with a JDAM. I'm not sure if this is possible

May be worth mentioning.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.69.38.87|62.69.38.87]] ([[User talk:62.69.38.87|talk]]) 01:36, 2 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::JDAM is just a kit that converts a 'Dumb Bomb' into a guided one, literally by bolting on the relevant fins and electronics.  Thus as far as holding and dropping it, there really isn't any difference other than the electronics hookups.  As long as the onboard computer had the appropriate software to calculate and display the impact point to the pilot,([[Constantly_computed_impact_point|CCIP]] for example) there's no reason it couldn't use an unguided bomb.  So long as the bomb would physically fit in the bay or on one of the wing hardpoints(though as discussed, using the wing hardpoints DESTROYS the stealth). -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.173|66.42.151.173]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.173|talk]]) 20:54, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

== Nuclear munitions ==

I believe, but I have no confirmation, that the F-22 is capable of carrying current air dropped/launched nuclear munitions.  The [[B83 nuclear bomb]] article states that it is capable of being delivered by the F-22, but it has no citations.  Is it possible that we can find citations for this? &amp;mdash;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold; font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;[[User:Scetoaux|scetoaux]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Scetoaux|talk]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Scetoaux|My contributions.]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 03:02, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

:Semi-helpful poking around: both the B83 and the B61 are approx 2 feet longer than the 1000 pound JDAMs the F-22 is stated to be able to carry internally, in fact they're closer in size to a 2000 pound JDAM than a 1000 pounder at about 12 feet, at least that's what wikipedia and its sources say.  An AMRAAM however is about 12 feet long, so length wise either would probably fit.
:Diameter wise you got a different story.  B83 is about 18 inches, B61 about 13 inches.  A 2000 pound JDAM is either around 18 inches, or a bit over 14 inches, depending on version.  A 1000 pound JDAM is either 14 inches or not quite 11, again depending on version.
:Weight on the other hand... B83 clocks in at around 2400 pounds, well over what the F-22 is supposedly capable of carrying internally.  B61 is about 700 pounds.
:Leading to the ultimate conclusion, assuming all this data is right, that if the dang thing can carry a B83, it's probably only on the wing pylons, the bugger's almost without a doubt too big and heavy for the bay.  Granted it can probably carry just about anything we've got that's airdroppable on the pylons, as they're estimated at a capacity of 5000 pounds.  A B61 might, might be possible internally(though it sounds like it might possibly be a tightish squeeze).  Obvious problem there is you'd have to be nuts to carry stuff on the pylons atm, as it completely negates the stealth.  Thus while it might be possible, a B83 ain't likely to happen anytime soon.  Unless they get those stealth wing pods working and make them freaking big.
:Trying to find something to verify that has so far turned up nada.  Trying to get something about the B61 possibility in particular is heavily complicated by the fact that an old F-22 Flight Sim(which I have, actually), included such a possibility in the game.  Being able to drop nukes was one of the most touted features of the game, so most attempts to link the F-22 to the B61 turn up that game high on the list.  -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.173|66.42.151.173]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.173|talk]]) 12:01, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

::Slight Correction.  I got going so fast that I missed one thing, it's capable of carrying two 1000 pound JDAMs *with* two AMRAAMs, all of it in the bay.  This suggests there's some extra room in the bay anyway, potentially allowing for larger sized ordinance if the AMRAAMs are left out(assuming it has an appropriate rack in the center of the bays to hold it, and that it's not too big in diameter to fit.  I've got no evidence as to either, pure speculation here).  The counter-arguement there is that nowhere have I ever heard anything about it being able to carry a 2000 pound bomb internally, AMRAAMs or not.  As the B83 is reasonably close in size and weight to a 2000 pound conventional, finding somewhere that it could carry a bomb of that size would suggest(but obviously not prove) that possibility.  Unfortunately, everything I've ever seen or heard indicated that two 1000 pounders was the internal limit.  -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.173|66.42.151.173]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.173|talk]]) 07:32, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

== Unit Cost ==

I'm questioning the unit cost of the F-22 at ~$140 million. There's a discrepancy with the F-35 Lightning. The F-22 was supposed to be the pinnacle fighter for the USAF. The F-35 was supposed to be a &quot;watered down&quot; version of the F-22 and an F-16 replacement. How is it that we have a ~$140 million unit cost for F-22 and ~$200 million unit cost for the F-35? One of the Wiki's is wrong. I should add that a recent report by the GAO said the F-35 program had ballooned in cost and is also behind schedule.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[gelato]] ([[gelato|talk]]) 16:08, 3 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I think if the USAF makes a Unmaned jet fighter, the F-22 or the F-35 would be the ones to do it with. The F-22 is so mauverable that there are things that keep it from killing the pilot! if we took the pilot out and put in a robot, it would be a huge advantage over everyone.

I am of the belief that this does nothing in the way of educating readers on the aircraft.

:that they've said it IS factual.  If what they said is true is open to debate I suppose.  That they're biased in favor the aircraft is undoubtedly true, but keep in mind that *EVERYONE* is biased, including any possible source that can be used, and in fact each and every contributor to the article and any debate about it, including yourself.  In your case you sound more than a little hostile and defensive right off the bat, a stance which is likely to attract all sorts of enmity from some of the very people you're trying to convince if it escalates.  Keep in mind [[WP:MASTODONS]] and we can avoid the kinds of stress, strife, and most importantly punishments that come with such Bad Things as flame wars, edit wars, and personal attacks.
:Keep in mind that quotes from people involving the aircraft can be and in this case are indeed relevant to the article.  The key is to always, always, always keep in mind wikipedia's very strict [[WP:NPOV|Neutral Point of View]] rules.  Any praise, or criticism, should be presented always in a neutral and balanced way.  Simply including it does NOT make it non-neutral, unless it's included in a way that presents it as the 'correct' or 'better' point of view.  In this case both quotes are qualified as being 'claims'.  They are not in fact presented as facts, but as claims by the primary user and a potential user.  It is very explicitly stated that they are in fact opinions and not necessarily true simply by the way they are included.
:Rather than trying to get them removed(especially by confrontation!  That's just bad things waiting to happen), a better response might be to find some illustrations of opposing viewpoints and include them as well, in order to improve the balance of it.
:Also Rigdon, a few quick wikipedia tips.  If you place a Colon(:) at the beginning of a line, it will indent that line, allowing a 'threading' structure.  Each colon added does one indentation.  Each level of a thread can be indicated simply by adding one more colon was on the last thread.  None for the initial post, one for the reply, two for the reply to the reply, etc, making following the flow of the discussion far easier.  You can also automatically sign and datestamp your posts by including four tildes(~) in a row at the end, which can be automatically inserted by clicking the 'sign your username' link just under the bold warning about not using non GFDL compatible text.  These two things make attributing specific comments and understanding the discussion far easier on talk pages, and will contribute greatly to getting your point of view heard. -Graptor [[Special:Contributions/66.42.151.173|66.42.151.173]] ([[User talk:66.42.151.173|talk]]) 22:27, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

I recently read an interesting interview with Gen Zelin of the Russian Air Force, so i decided to add the quote on his view on the Raptor, but apparently it was removed in less than a day. We've already got two extremely western-biased opinionated quotes (almost as if the USAF had edited this article in propaganda purposes), so why is it that the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force General Alexander Zelin (an expert opinion if you ask me) is not allowed, while the two existing ones are?

== Question about thrust ==

I'm looking for some clarification about the F-22 engine's thrust. I've been going to various articles about fighters and trying to compare the levels of thrust and thrust to weight ration etc, but when I came to this one I see that the quoted figures are not in the same format as in the other articles. For instance in the [[Eurofighter]] article there are two separate figures provided for the thrust i.e. &quot;''Dry thrust: 60 kN (13,500 lbf) each. Thrust with afterburner: 90 kN (20,000 lbf) each''&quot;, whereas this article only provides a single figure &quot;''Powerplant: 2× Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 Pitch Thrust vectoring turbofans, 35,000+ lb (156+ kN) each''&quot;. So does this figure mean it has 156 kN '''''Dry thrust''''' or 156 kN '''''Thrust with afterburner'''''? Or is it that this engine system doesn’t distinguish between the two? (i.e. is 156 kN the Maximum or Average thrust?). So anyone know about this? --[[User:Hibernian|Hibernian]] ([[User talk:Hibernian|talk]]) 20:15, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

: For any article without dry power thrust listed, then the thrust listed is max thrust.  That's one of the most common spec provided. -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 15:35, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== F-22 Raptor Weapons Acquisition - IEEE article ==

The F-22 is featured on the cover of the November, 2008 IEEE Spectrum magazine under the title &quot;Weapons Acquisition - Spending Too Much, Getting Too Little.&quot; (see http://spectrum.ieee.org/weapons )&lt;br /&gt;The article cites a number of DoD programs, and includes a separate sub-article entitled &quot;F-22: Success, Failure, or Both?&quot; which provides a brief discussion of the F-22 acquisition and outlines its acquisition history, framing it as a failure (see http://spectrum.ieee.org/nov08/6931/weapsb1 ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is whether/where/how to bring up this aspect of a weapons system, since it could be useful in classifying this weapons system's effectiveness. I'd like to know how experienced Wikipedians would deal with this dimension of this article in particular, and weapon systems in general.

== Loaded weight ==

How do we estimate the &quot;loaded weight&quot;? Would that be plane+fuel?
If the empty F22 weights 19,700 kg and the internal fuel is given with 8,200 kg, how can the loaded planes weight be
25,107 kg?--[[User:HTG2000|HTG2000]] ([[User talk:HTG2000|talk]]) 12:16, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

: Loaded weight is often the normal takeoff weight.  In other words a typical weapons load and not a full fuel load.  Not sure where the value listed in the specs came from.  It looked reasonable before the recent empty weight change/update.  Still have doubts on that... -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 12:49, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

:: I see, I just checked the history and realised that the empty weight changed from ~15t to ~19t. With the old ~15t figure the &quot;25t loaded&quot; makes sense: ~15tplane+~8tfuel+~1tweaponary. But with the new 19t figure its all messed up. Wouldn't that mean we have to change the &quot;loaded weight&quot; and also the t/w ratio?--[[User:HTG2000|HTG2000]] ([[User talk:HTG2000|talk]]) 13:16, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

I did some math and with the updated &quot;empty weight&quot; the &quot;loaded weight&quot; should be ~29.200kg (empty weight+8.2t fuel+6AMRAAM+2AIM9+pilot) That would make a T/W ratio of 1,09. Does everybody agree? --[[User:HTG2000|HTG2000]] ([[User talk:HTG2000|talk]]) 14:29, 18 June 2008 (UTC)
* Thanks, those estimated/calculated numbers look reasonable but that seems like original research.  I'd say to just delete the loaded weight values from those fields if they weren't used for the thrust to weight ratio. Wait until the data is provided by a valid source. Any other ideas, anybody? -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 14:55, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

If the &quot;19t empty&quot; figure given by LM and USAF is true the figures given for &quot;loaded weight&quot; and the t/w-ratio in the Wiki-article are definitely wrong. The problem is that my calculations are based on estimates (weapons/fuel), but so were the previous figures for &quot;t/w&quot; and &quot;loaded weight&quot;. I checked the sources given for the &quot;Specifications&quot; section and none of them gave an actual t/w or &quot;loaded weight&quot; figure. Maybe we should remove both figures and replace them with a &quot;Specification needed&quot;-tag? I dont dare to do it myself..:) --[[User:HTG2000|HTG2000]] ([[User talk:HTG2000|talk]]) 15:59, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

The German Wiki had the exact same discussion last night, at least they have a better calculation basis than my estimates:
19700kg(plane) + 8200kg(fuel) + 1142kg (6 AMRAAM + 2 AIM-9X) + 292kg (munition for the canon)= 29334kg without Pilot.
That makes a t/w ratio of 1.08 (31754/29334=1,08) I guess we should use those figures as they are more exact than my estimates.

::Just have to weigh into this and ask, is it normal for a loaded weight to include the maximum internal fuel? I'm not trying to suggest lowering the figure but if you're going to do independent research perhaps it should be established first what the 'standard' fuel load for an F-22A is. There are ranges with different kinds of aircraft ... some light fighters have very limited internal fuel so carry a full load every time ... other heavy fighters are designed to take more internal fuel then is typically required just in case. The fact that the F-22A is a stealth aircraft might add to that. It is often equipped with external tanks BUT theres a good chance they would increase its RCS ... in other words perhaps it was designed so that in the interception role it could carry a 70-80% load of internal fuel, no tanks and still be considered 'loaded'. I suspect this is the case with the Su-27 ... although I could be wrong.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.107.140.247|122.107.140.247]] ([[User talk:122.107.140.247|talk]]) 10:58, 8 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Prior to transformers I'm pretty sure the f-22 was featured in the movie The Incredible Hulk, the hulk grabs onto it and the F-22  pilot takes him for a ride. Is this worth mentioning?

::Thanks. I had missed that section. Still though, what constitutes major? It isn't like Starscream was a focal point of the TF movie. Maybe my memory is off, but as far as Raptor action goes I recall him shooting a missile at the ground forces in the city and having a brief skirmish with the human Raptor squadron. He takes off when injured, the F-22's pursue, and next time we see Starscream he's running away. Hardly comparable to Top Gun and the F-14. It just seems that the F-22's appearances thus far in films have been relatively brief sequences of the military running afoul of some super-character or another, a scuffle ensuing, and then the film moves on.

I added that. If a complete fight with Hulk, in a scene lasted for several minuts is not notable, so what's the point to have a 'culture pop' section at all. Hulk was a notable movie (who says that Transformer is more notable, after all? Because it was made by Spielberg?) and the scene was surely notable, not a few seconds one, with no intereset.

'''5)In far east there are 2Pair of devided country which seek unification like Vietnum.''' 
*In 2003 China and North Korea uniratrally aimed 1300 missiles to South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.In 2009 it increased over 2000 missiles more than 1845 SS20s which Soviet Union aimed to Europe at European Cold War era. And more than 1.5million troops are still alarting beside DMZ of Korean peninsula. And North Korean old nationalist generals cannot accept south oriented unification and runnning on the road of Nuke armament. Legacy cold war still exist in far east, becuse of two divided country.
   
'''6)How Taiwan and South Korea and Japan asked them, North Korea and China have not Stopped their military expansion.''' 
*Because of huge deficit of the goverment,Japan really hoped mutual disarmament but no chioce.  

'''Merit for US employment and Trade deficit'''
*If pentagon finish development of &quot;Confidential Part Delited Water downed export variant of F-22&quot; until 2014-2018,and if congress aprove to build 60around F-22s for &quot;bridging production&quot;,F-22 export Japan business can susutain 25000 direct employment and 70000poeople's indirect jobs,until 2030-2040. If Israel or Australia order it then employment will be increase.
*In 2007 US Trade deficit to Japan is $82billion,US grobal arm export is $7.5billion. 200 F-22s+150 F-35s value is $74billion

'''Development cost collection for US taxpayers'''
*F-22s development cost is $28billion. and unit procument cost is $142million.  And US quoted Japan &quot;Water downed Variant development cost&quot; $2.3billion which Japan should pay,Unit salling price $233million per unit, for first lot 40 F-22s.($9.3 billion for 40 F-22s). That mean US taxpayer can recollect F-22's development cost,$91million($233million-$142million)per unit export.  If US sell 200 F-22s then US taxpayers can correct $18.2 billion(200x$91million) by FMS. So it is strange Mr Gates complain to $8.5billion 60 F-22s bridge order investments for getting $18.2 billion export revenue for US Taxpayers. If pentagon report&quot;Export is possible&quot;then US Taxpayers can get 60 F-22s by FREE and more over can collect $9.7billion.

'''[[Sukhoi PAK FA]] and [[J-XX]]'''
*F-22 is too eary born than her rivals but even if Soviet Union collupted,Russia still capable to develop &amp; equip &amp; export F-22's rival.And rising China also have been developping her indignus 5th Gen. Twin engine Stealth fighter [[J-XX]] by using world No2 military expenditure.  
*In 2009 Russia start fright test of [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] and it will be deployed 2012-2015. [[J-XX]] are said to be deployed 2015-2020. If US only build 187 F-22s and close it's production line at 2009,and 2009-2015 Russia and China will start fright test of [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] and [[J-XX]].And if they deploy 400-600 each [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] and [[J-XX]],US may lose global air power superiority.
*There are no&quot;stealth fighter mutual disarmament treaty&quot;. And China's production cost is much cheaper than OECD countries. At least US need to be wach out how many [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] and [[J-XX]] will be built, before rush to close F-22s production line.
*That's why airfoce General mentioned &quot;close production line at only 187 F-22s is risky, 247 F-22s still moderate risky.&quot; --[[User:Jack332|Jack332]] ([[User talk:Jack332|talk]]) 13:25, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

::I looked at MaeseLeon’s source; basically, what we have here is a reporter’s misunderstanding of what he is writing about.  (A first time for that, eh?)  A ''cancellation'' of the F-22 would mean abruptly ending an existing production contract.  What is actually going on is that the new administration is trying to decide whether to place ''further orders'' for the airplane.  The DoD was supposed to have decided by March whether to place a firm order for the long-lead items for the first four of another 20-aircraft “Lot 10” batch, but they slipped that to April, and it may now not be until May.  The longer the decision is delayed, the more likely it is that there will be a break in production, which would make further orders more costly.  The USAF would actually like to have that and two further batches (11 and 12) of the same size before production ends.

Gates thinks that the F-22 is the best plane the Air Force has--the thing is, like most of the F-22 critics, he thinks that the F-22 is TOO GOOD, is tops in more areas than a CAPABLE jet needs to be tops in, and that's why it's unnecessarily expensive. Instead, he wants to keep the small numbers of the F-22's that we already have to use as sort of a first strike secret weapon, while making up the rest of the Air Force with cheaper, ALMOST as good, F-35's. Personally, not that it matters here, LOL, I agree with him. Why spend billions more on 100's of more F-22's that 10 years from now may be outclassed by stealth fighters made by other countries. Let's use the F-22's we have, build lots of F-35's, then when other nations build their 5th generation planes, we'll come out after them with even better F-22 Mark 2's.[[Special:Contributions/68.164.6.249|68.164.6.249]] ([[User talk:68.164.6.249|talk]]) 01:16, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

::''Shutting down the line'' is not necessarily the same thing as ''cancelling'' the program. Gates proposed canceling several programs, such as the VH-71. The F-22 program of record (POR) calls for 183 aircraft, and Gates is proposing 187 – the POR aircraft plus the 4 GWOT supplemental proposed by Congress. (It would actually be fair to say he is proposing ''extending'' the program by four aircraft.) &quot;Cancellation&quot; of a program is what happens either prior to its planned entry into production or a work halt imposed in the midst of an ongoing production contract; what Gates is really proposing is &quot;capping&quot; the program at 187 aircraft.

== Yak-43 ==

Regarding the possible desing influences of the Yak-43 on the F-22, please note that both Bill Gunston and Yefim Gordon, the two most widley published authors of books on Soviet aircraft, have both stated that the similarities between the earlier Yak-43 design and the F-22 are too great for there not to have been an influence. Please remember that Lockheed-Martin was already working very closely with the Yak-43 design team on several systems for the future F-35 at the time the design of the F-22 was being developed. Finally, I would encourage anyone who wants to dismiss this as a possibility to first look at the design drawings of the Yak-43 dating from 1983-1984. There is little doubt that Lockheed-Martin gained a lot more than just VTOL development from their $400 million investment in Yakovlev. - [[User:Ken keisel|Ken keisel]] ([[User talk:Ken keisel|talk]]) 22:48, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

:I've seen a pic in Y. Gordon's book of one the Yak-41/-43 offshoots, and it does resemble the F-22. However, to even imply a connection without direct supporting statements from reliable sources is too much of a stretch. Companies are capable of arriving at similar designes totally independent of each other. At least that is what we are told re: the Su-24, Tu-144, Buran, etc! Btw, Mark, do you have any cited info on the extent of the relation between the X/F-35B and the Yak-141? We currently have conflicting info based on separate sources.

::I don't know what image Gordon has (perhaps a publisher's error?), but when I look at them, I see no real resemblance at all. The Yak-43 layout follows a clear evolution from the Yak-38 and Yak-41/141. The F-22's layout comes from a variety of factors, not the least of which are signatures reduction. I frankly believe the general layout of the F-22's design was pretty much settled (though tweaking remained) well before the Yak-43 even became known to the West.

::As for Yak's influence on the F-35, I've already added a link there to my earlier explanation of the exact relationship. I'll try to see if I can find some sources.

:::Based on what few drawings one can find of the proposed Yak-43, the &quot;eyeball test&quot; would seem to reveal that the F-22 has much more of its basic layout design in common with the aircraft that it was built to succeed, the F-15.

It underscored his belief that future wars are going to be more like these current conflicts, for which the F-22 is not necessary, than more traditional scenarios with peer or near-peer opponents.  Also, the USAF does want more, it’s Secretary Gates who does not; if they were in agreement, there’d be a whole lot less controversy.

== Major Neutrality Problems with this Article ==

I came here to find some information and to see if the article could be used as a link as university course materials.  While the article is excellent in its presentation of the plane's specifications and development history, its political and social history is severely lacking.  After quickly reading through the discussion I can see that this has been a ongoing problem; a problem that this community should try to solve soon.  As an encyclopeaida, especially a popular online wiki, the article needs to answer the questions of many different users who will come to this article for information.  Wikipedia is not a Janes military reference book.  As such, it also needs to have information about all aspects of a subject.  This would include the plane's conception and design in the Cold War and why funding was proposed to be cut in the most recent DoD budget request. The controversies surrounding the plane also need to be covered, especially so since this would be one of the major motivating factors for users coming to the article at this particular moment in its history. Like I said, this is an excellent article in terms of the technical information and reference materials but it must have information about the social and political aspects, especially when the plane is so much in the news.   &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:DClearwater|DClearwater]] ([[User talk:DClearwater|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/DClearwater|contribs]]) 17:56, 3 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Most of that type info can not be found in an [[Encyclopedia]].  Encyclopedias and in particular Wikipedia do not cover current events like a news service.

: I did not mean that the statistics and reference material be removed.  As I said, that aspect of the article is excellent.  What I mean is that there has to be factual information about the social and political nature of any topic.  For example, the plane's length of development (i.e. conceived at the height of the Cold War) and recent changes to U.S. military strategy essentially resulted in a reduction of its planned use and then the funding cuts (these events affect it political history). From that comes its social history (including the controversy that resulted over the proposed cut to its funding). Such information can be presented in a factual manner that will not contravene [[WP:What Wikipedia is not]]. Similarly, listing factual information about criticism of the project as a whole does not mean that the entire article is biased. In fact, leaving out information about these aspects of the plane's history could be considered as contravening neutrality.  I mean, imagine the entry for the Vietnam War (or any other controversial topic) not including information about protests or changes to public opinion. Also, when I mentioned that the plane is so newsworthy right now, I did not mean that this wikipedia entry should act as a new service, but that since the plane (and its funding cuts) are in the news, it would be reasonable to assume that many people would seek information by consulting its article here.  That is why there needs to be factual information about all aspects of the plane and project. --[[User:DClearwater|DClearwater]] ([[User talk:DClearwater|talk]]) 19:29, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry, another quick remark. The current version of the article sounds like an encyclopedic entry for an aeronautical engineering reference book.  Of course, that is very good.  But what the article lacks, are the perspectives of other disciplines. The wikipedia entry for Encyclopedia ( [[Encyclopedia]] ), clearly defines it as &quot;a comprehensive written compendium that holds information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.&quot; Wikipedia is general in nature so we need the approach from different disciplines or branches of knowledge. --[[User:DClearwater|DClearwater]] ([[User talk:DClearwater|talk]]) 20:10, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

::: I don't understand your meaning here... if no detail, then why does the article already have many details about the engineering and procurement process?

::::: Whoa, whoa, whoa... the current article has a heading about the public display of the aircraft so there is a lot of detail already.  I don't see it as a problem that the article is heavy in favour of the history of the engineering of the aircraft, but you are asking that no other aspect of the plane/project be included. I am sorry, but that is why the neutrality of this article is missing. This plane is not just a plane, it is a part of the U.S. defense sector and a major part of Pentagon funding and U.S. gov. expenditures. Sadly, as such it gets caught up in the larger politics of U.S. society... all I am saying is that we cannot deny that fact and therefore it needs to be reflected in the content of the article. --[[User:DClearwater|DClearwater]] ([[User talk:DClearwater|talk]]) 21:25, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I understand that many who have contributed to the article have done an excellent job (and, more broadly, have contributed a lot to wikipedia) so I am not trying to be confrontational here.

::Actually, if I understand you properly, your issue is not so much with [[WP:NPOV|''neutrality'']], per se, as it is with the ''scope'' of coverage. Is that correct? That's always a challenge; at some point providing context plus balancing POVs runs into another problem with trying to balance it against [[WP:UNDUE]].  Considering that pretty much all major government programs — defense and non-defense — attract controversy, debate, and cost issues, it's unclear just what to cover. It's relative easy in those cases where the issue is ''unique'' to (in this instance) the airplane because those are usually fairly clear-cut; the problem is just how much all of the timeless dove/hawk debate should one cover? Perhaps you could share, from your perspective, what 1-3 issues are ''most notable'' with respect to the F-22 — what you think the average Joe/Jane Reader might most wish to find information on here.

::: Hi Askari. Yes, but it is a neutrality issue in the sense that there has been a concerted effort here to prevent any mention of public or political controversy surrounding the plane and project as a whole. As a result, the cultural significance of the plane/project has also been resisted. It could be argued that restricting the scope of an article is similar to only allowing one dominant POV. My main issue here is that the article's current focus is almost exclusively from an aeronautical/engineering perspective. If wikipedia was solely an engineering/aeronautical encyclopedia, that would be fine.  But the general scope of wikipedia means that other disciplinary perspectives need to be reflected in the article; for example, political science, media studies, popular culture studies, etc. Now, that may mean that others take the lead in creating these sections but since wikipedia is a collaborative and community-driven project, that should not present a problem. With a plane as iconic as this one, there definitely needs to be a 'cultural significance' section (which could include the current 'popular culture' section).  A section on the criticisms of the program (that is, dealing with politics surrounding the program) and a section on funding controversy are needed too. As long as these sections are well-written, there should be few reasonable issues with balance or providing context... but, again, all perspectives need to be represented.  Again, there is already an incredible amount of detail in the article but it is from a single discipline's POV. No group or discipline should have final say about the entire scope of an article here on wikipedia.

:::@DClearwater: Personally, I don't think the F-22 is all that &quot;iconic&quot; which makes it difficult for me to understand just what to do with your suggestions (which are more nebulous than I was hoping for).  It's true that Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTPAPER|not paper]], there is an effective limit to the size of an article beyond which it engenders &quot;reader fatigue&quot; – which I rather suspect we're at already.  This article is basically about the airplane; to cover a host of other disciplines' perspectives – and keep it within the bounds of [[WP:UNDUE]] would make the article even more unwieldy than it already is.

:::Despite the perceptions of some, the active editors here have never been opposed to including negative information and controversies about the F-22; indeed, much of it has already been worked into the article.  As long as it's presented in a balanced, well-sourced and preferably pithy fashion, that's fine.  You will have observed, though, a lot of resistance to the inclusion of a &quot;Controversies&quot; section.  Experience here and on other articles has demonstrated that these become magnets for every sort of negative issue (notable and trivial) that can be found, only negative information is supplied with no attempt to present both sides, and they become overly long.

:::From what you have written, I see that you would like (ouch!) three new sections:  a &quot;cultural significance&quot; section, one on &quot;political issues&quot; regarding the airplane, and another on &quot;funding controversy&quot;.  I would like to ask for more specifics and some clarifications.  Regarding the first, I'm not aware of media studies or popular culture studies on the F-22; are there are some seminal ones you could point us to?  I've already partially addressed the political issues theme, insofar as using a &quot;Controversies&quot; section per se; I'd appreciate your thoughts on a specific few you think most notable – as opposed to those issues simply endemic to major government (and particularly defense) programs.  (I would suspect the politics of ending the program would be one – and we are already incorporating that.)  As for the third, what specific &quot;funding controversy&quot; (or controversies) are you referring to?

:::: @Askari: sorry, I have to be brief here. Honestly, one only has to look over the past discussions and edits to see that there has been an (informal?) effort here to limit the wiki page to just what is already there.  I can even see a pattern that whenever a discussion of anything that might appear as negative comes up, it is quickly minimized away ('the article is too long already,' 'its a magnet for criticism,' or by simply posting one sentence replies that point to entire wiki-articles or definitions about POV or whatever).  I do agree that some of the past information was not neutral in its wording but that only means that the wording has to be edited.  Instead, these sections have been deleted. As for the 'iconic' status of the plane... of course, its iconic and very high profile.  That is why there are multiple videogames entirely devoted to the plane itself... and this is a part of its cultural significance (which is not all negative BTW). &quot;What funding controversies?&quot; You're kidding right?  --[[User:DClearwater|DClearwater]] ([[User talk:DClearwater|talk]]) 15:51, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:::::No, not kidding.  There are and have been a number of funding controversies regarding the F-22.  Whether to fund further production is just one – and since it’s being addressed already and you seemed to be suggesting a funding controversy not being covered here.  (By the way, whenever it is decided to end further production, there will be another controversy over which shut-down approach to follow and how much that costs.  For instance, if there will be a need to hold onto items for further production – possibly for Japan – then that requires a different approach than a total shutdown and is more expensive.)

:::::I’d dispute your perception that there has been an (informal) attempt to keep negative information out of this article; if it were true, then it would be hard to explain how any has made it in.  Whether we agree on how iconic the F-22 might be, I think we’d both agree that this article attracts a very high degree of vandalism.  Some attempts to add cited negative information may have been accidentally interpreted as such.  On the other hand I’ve noted that when such editors have been invited to add properly cited negative material along with properly cited contrary views, nothing of the sort ever appears ... all that remains is griping by same that they didn’t get their (uncited or unreliably) negative material in.  That tends to be a clear sign of POV-pushing; after all, it’s not that hard to find and provide such balanced information ... if one desires to. That invitation is a standing one and it's a good one for editors to hone their NPOV skills on. 

:::::In any case, I think your real beef is with those who aren’t the regular editors.  Please note the quick removal of “negative” material Hcobb and I put in.

:::::After having a chance to thoroughly read the arguments and points here, I have to agree with user DClearwater, and Falcon 8765, on the above issues.  Also, some of us are inspired by the possibility that this article could become more credible and reach next class at some point not too far in the future, yet, edits to include information on it's political and procurement controversies have been reverted at almost every turn.  For example, Hcobb just vaporized some sourced material on a congressional vote, an edit I don't believe is very inclusive or appropriate.  This article will never have the degree of encyclopedic dimension that the [[B-2 Spirit]] article has with such edits.  It seems there's no clear consensus here so far on keeping the article in the style of a &quot;Janes military reference book&quot; or &quot;aeronautical engineering reference book,&quot; and to be clear, it does currently smacks of such material, IMHO.  That this article is listed in WP:project aircraft should not preclude or overshadow the inclusion of other notable economic and political issues. In consideration of the scope of public expenditure on this project, it's grossly lacking in comprehensive detail. Should we open an [[WP:Rfc]] on this?

Yes I opened up an arbitration page, but owing to a busy schedule, this is the first time I have been able to do anything wiki-wise in awhile. I just read over the talk page and it seems that some of these issues still have not been resolved. I was pleasantly surprised, however, when maintenance issues finally appeared in the article, though getting those there was a fight as well.  The last two issues that have yet to be resolved are A: the role that the f22 will play in current and future likely combat scenarios and B: direct comparisons with the planes that the F22 will be replacing (the F16).  Both issues need to be addressed if this article is not to read like a book from Lockheed-Martin. If need be, we can take this to arbitration.

:Only thing the Raptor is replacing is the F-15C and only a few of those.  The F-16 replacement is the F-35, always has been and always will be.  As for the F-22 mission, it's really simple.

As for adding a comparison of the F-22 and F-15, I'm afraid I don't see the point.  Any reader can compare the specs from the two respective articles.  To add such a section while not tripping over [[WP:RS]] by quoting Wikipedia nor conducting [[WP:NOR|OR]], we'd have to find a source that does so.

== External tanks ==

In the Armament section, the paragraph about the external hardpoints says: &quot;The wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle 5,000 lb (2,300 kg). Each hardpoint has a pylon that can carry a detachable 600 gallon fuel tank&quot;. But then later in the paragraph we have: &quot;The two inner hardpoints are &quot;plumbed&quot; for external fuel tanks&quot;. So, we have a little contradiction there :-) [[User:McSly|McSly]] ([[User talk:McSly|talk]]) 23:33, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== Trading Raptors for Super Hornets? ==

Hcobb, I removed the following text because it needs further clarification and a couple of corrections before going back in: 
*The effectiveness of stealth is greatly improved when combined with electronic jamming and the need for additional jammer aircraft was one reason cited by the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the termination of the F-22 production line in favor of the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/08/navy_EW_080209w/ Joint operation uncertain as Prowler retires]&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the clarification:  Since the F-22 itself reputedly has jamming capabilities, it’s unclear why “additional jammer aircraft” are needed (or why they couldn’t be more F-22s).  I think you meant to say something along the line of “when combined with ''standoff'' [or ''offboard''] electronic jamming”.

Second, the correction.  The F-22 line is '''not''' being terminated in favor of the F/A-18 Super Hornet.  This statement does not accurately capture what the source says; what Gen. Cartwright said was “it was one reason for halting the Air Force’s F-22 fighter program and ''potentially redirecting that money toward electronic attack''.” [emphasis added].  Note that he says nothing about the F/A-18 or any other aircraft – and in any case, it’s the [[EA-18G Growler]] that is the jammer.

:How about the primary source, i.e. the actual transcript?

http://armed-services.senate.gov/Transcripts/2009/07%20July/09-58%20-%207-9-09.pdf
Another thing that weighed heavily certainly in my calculus was
the input of the combatant commanders, and one of the highest
issues of concern from the combatant commanders is our ability to
conduct electronic warfare. That electronic warfare is carried onboard
the F–18. And so, looking at the lines that we would have
in hot production, number one priority was to get fifth generation
fighters to all of the Services. Number two priority was to ensure
that we had a hot production line in case there was a problem, and
number three was to have that hot production line producing F–
18 Gulfs, which support the electronic warfare fight.
So those issues stacked up to a solid position, at least on my
part, that it was time to terminate the F–22. It is a good airplane.
It is a fifth generation fighter. But we needed to proliferate those
fifth generation fighters to all of the Services, and we needed to ensure
that we were capable of continuing to produce aircraft for the
electronic warfare capability, and that was in the F–18. In the F–
18, we can also produce front-line fighters that are more than capable
of addressing any threat that we will face for the next 5 to 10
years.

:Um, that line of reasoning seems to go more like 'DEQ' than 'QED'.  I'm not sure how Cartwright came up with the idea of shutting down a hot production line (that is the only extant hot fifth-gen line to boot) &quot;to ensure that that we had a hot production line in case there was a problem&quot;, but that is what the man said. (He also has two &quot;point two's&quot; – I'm definitely not letting him teach my kids math.)  In any case, the fact that EW was only &quot;another thing&quot; (after the first 2 – or 3 – points) hardly hand [[Death (personification)|Death's]] scythe to the F/A-18.

Now if there are a dozen or more votes on this bird, they don't all deserve their own paragraph, per se, but each vote or groupings of votes could be reduced to a well-sourced clause in a sentence, for example, if editors at that time feel that's appropriate.

::I concur with Chris. Removal of the information prior to the resolution bill making it out was premature. However, Hcobb is correct that there was no real or implied claim that the F-35 is all-around superior to the F-22. What has been said is that the F-22 is superior to the F-35 in air-to-air (and SEAD, per some), but the F-35 is more flexible in that it is a multirole aircraft with excellent air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities.

:Well, that is true, but the source leaves that linkage implicit, not explicit.  Right now the F-22 is the most capable “escort jamming” aircraft the USAF has.  There are only a few ways they can redress this:  1) buy more EC-130s and EC-135s, which aren’t really suited for this role or survivable in it; 2) continue developing the EB-52, which has just been canceled (again), isn’t ready for production, and can’t keep up with modern fighters; 3) buy more F-22s (which wouldn’t seem to be in the cards, even assuming its reputed electronic attack capability is really up to the role); or 4) purchase – or transfer funds to the Navy to buy – EA-18Gs (which would make the USAF the poster child for ''lèse-majesté'').  But Cartwright does not say funds saved from cancelling the F-22 would go to EW at all, much less to Growlers.

I think it should be clarified that a) the plane has never flown a combat mission as the congress has voted to halt production (I think this is notable for a plane with these far reaching goals) &lt;ref&gt;http://chattahbox.com/us/2009/07/21/congress-votes-58-40-to-stop-f-22-production/&lt;/ref&gt;, and b) that is has had issues with rain.

:That argument is a red herring. The same could be said about modern nuclear weapons: never used, no longer in production.

:::I don't know whether to laugh or to cry.  First off, it's not true that the F-22 hasn't been used in combat ''because'' the Congress has voted to discontinue production.  In actuality, Gates noted – several months before Congress voted on the issue – that the F-22 hadn't been used in Iraq or Afghanistan as one of his reasons why he saw no need for further production.  Now, if I had not heard it with my own two ears, I would never have believed that anyone intelligent enough to serve as a Secretary of Defense (and a former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] to boot) would say something so inanely irrelevant – not to mention that detracts from his message by bringing into question the amount of thought that went into his other points.  Think about it folks:  what is being offered as a &quot;criticism&quot; of the F-22 is basically a recognition that the U.S. military has responsibly not mis-used the aircraft – and thereby wasting tight operations and maintenance funds – for missions it was not designed for.  It's an air superiority machine that can also take out &quot;double-digit&quot; SAMs; neither the Iraqi insurgents nor Afghan Talibani have fighters (or any other aircraft, for that matter) or advanced SAMs networked in an integrated air defense system.  Yes, it would be easy to send a few F-22s over to drop a few bombs on guerrillas and claim they are &quot;battle-tested&quot; – and Secretary Gates has all the authority he needs to &quot;make it so&quot;.  (And, yes, unfortunately, there are precedents for just such an irresponsible action.)  That he hasn't done so is a &quot;good thing&quot;; that he effectively criticizes ''himself'' for not doing so is a bizarre thing; that intelligent people take this inanity for a &quot;good thing&quot; because they believe it to be a &quot;criticism&quot; of a &quot;bad thing&quot; is a truly, truly sad thing.

Riddle me this Batman, how's that Raptor spotting that SAM without IRST and what weapon will it use against it?  The next-gen SAM hunter is the F-35, which is constantly slammed for having decent air to ground capabilities. The truth is that it's insurgencies all the way down.  We're gladly lacking in peer competitors and anybody foolish enough to take the open field against the Americans deserves their afterlife.  So the mission for the F-22 is the same as the mission of the most advanced Russian fighters, attending airshows.  [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 03:51, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

And on what basis do you prognosticate that there will never be a need to achieve air superiority?

::::Well, there’s something called [[network-centric warfare]].  One possibility is having a UAV (or other air- or ground-based source) that has spotted one (by having been alerted to the area by other intel) hand off the target coordinates to an F-22 which then delivers a brace of satellite-guided JDAMs on the real target instead of the displaced antennas.

:::We can assume that the United States will be engaged in two types of conflicts in the future, against enemies who put a lot of thought into how to withstand the blows of Le Hyperpower and those that don't and we really don't need to worry too much about the later type.  The F-35 has better LPI comms than the F-22, but if the F-22 is just a dumb bomb truck that depends on &quot;something else&quot; to find targets for it then you need to define what that something else is and that looks a lot like a F-35, which can drop bigger bombs than the F-22 can.  As for air to air combat the best fighter radars the Russians have are outranged by the current AMRAAMs so they die before they see the F-35 and this is on top of being outnumbered by more than ten to one by those F-35s.

== Reserve Raptors ==

Certain units of the Air National Guard are slated to get Raptors.  What's the status of this and does it count as a pure USAF-only aircraft after this point?  [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 00:23, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

:The answer is, as we say, as clear as mud.  The USAF has what is known as the Total Force Integration (TFI) concept which matches up active-duty and reserve-component (Guard and Reserve) units to fly and support some of its fighters.  There is a main unit to which is attached a so-called &quot;associate&quot; unit.  Each Guard or Reserve unit scheduled to fly F-22s is &quot;associated&quot; with an active-duty unit, except in one case.  This exception is the 199th Fighter Squadron (Hawaii ANG) of the 54th Composite Wing, to which an active-duty unit, the 531st FS, will be associated.  The other reserve component units to scheduled to fly the F-22 are the 149th FS (Virginia ANG) of the 192nd Fighter Wing – which became the first Guard unit to operate the F-22 back in June 2008 – which is an &quot;associate&quot; unit conjoined with the active-duty 27th FS of the 1st FW, and the 301st FS (AFRC) which will lose its F-16s to serve as an associate unit to the active-duty 49th FW.  Since no more F-22s are to be built, it will probably be a very long time before any other reserve component squadron gets to fly Raptors. 

:The USANG isn't particularly happy with the TFI approach because it usually means supplying reserve-component air and ground crew personnel to support active-duty-owned airplanes; they would prefer their own aircraft on their own airbases.  Their F-15s and F-16s are due to wear out before they are scheduled to get F-35s, so they were hoping for further F-22s to be ordered since they prefer to fly what the active-duty Air Force ''will'' be flying, not what it ''was'' flying.  In any case, whether Guard-owned aircraft will be counted as belonging to the USAF, it depends upon what you are trying to count.  If you are counting numbers operated by the USAF overall, yes; if you're trying to distinguish between active duty and reserve component aircraft, then no.  Hope that helps.

== That's more like daydreaming ==

&gt; The F-22 is capable of functioning as a &quot;mini-AWACS.&quot; &lt;

That is impossble to do owing to human overload. The ex-WARPAC countries tried to play Mini-AWACS with the MiG-23MF shortly after the commie block fell. The MiG-23 has a really big radar dish, with a lot of rotation horizontally (plus an extra 60 degrees left and right available with manual steer override) and good ground clutter canceller. Sorrowfully, playing AWACS proved too much workload for a single pilot and that's not a issue a glass cockpit could fix. It is also very costly to use a supersonic fighterplane for mini-AWACS and USA has its economic problems nowadays.

* Well first off, you completely failed to even understand the whole point of that section, let alone read all of it.

Besides, given that nobody here actually has any personal knowledge of what the F-22 can really do, I think we should list all the capabilities that the manufacturer and USAF say it can do rather than dismiss an &quot;official&quot; capability just because some Wikipedian thinks that if something couldn't be done with the Mig-23 than obviously it can't be done with the F-22.

I'm quite sure the F22 HAS been used as a mini AWACS, during simulated combat against f15's, after expending all their missiles and cannon rounds, planes stayed on station, presumably an F22 can track an enemy and use the wireless link to tell another where it is.

The datalinking ability of the F22 does not require the pilot to run tactical mission allocation.  Ground teams and a real AWACs would do that.  While the pilot could be a FAC, the aircraft is essentially an extension of the sensor reach of the combined air assets that are data linking.  Ditto with the canceled Comanche, but for the JSTARS.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.178.139.76|66.178.139.76]] ([[User talk:66.178.139.76|talk]]) 22:01, 9 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I think that the technical criticisms should be separated from the criticisms of the program or the controversy over the reduction/funding-cuts as they are different issues.  The discussions over technical problems/flaws (not sure what the right word would be) could go into its own section under the technical aspects of the article (But as Hcobb says, there is plenty in the various sections already).

I had what I thought was a lot of knowledge of the F-22, including first-hand experience, but I was blown away by a Washington Post article on the maintenance issues of the F-22.  Yesterday I checked this wikie and found no mention of the maintenance issues, so I added it.  Then another user deleted every *referenced* fact I added and called them &quot;biased&quot; (a fact can be biased?) and &quot;redundant&quot; (there is no other mention of any of the facts I added). The facts included the cost of maintenance according to the SecDef, the average time between critical failure, susceptibility to rain and abrasion, flight readiness, and the need to hand-fit pieces.  

I agree that one sentence I added does sound biased &quot;The F-22 has not flown a single sortie in Iraq or Afghanistan, so actual battle data is not available.&quot; but I added that as an explanation as to why the data is from exercises.

:Having taken a look at the proposed &quot;Controversies&quot; section, I have to take exception to the claim that it was full of &quot;non-biased source citations&quot;.  Every claim quoted was an ''opinion'' from a source with an anti-F-22 position, and no rebuttals from supporters.  There was nothing NPOV about it.  The Maintenance section is better balanced, although most of the problems cited are sourced to a single ''Washington Post'' article.  Given that its sources are anonymous or have a fish to fry, that makes it a thin reed for reliability.  It should also be kept in mind that WaPo is well-known for publishing spin from anonymous insiders in the government.  As the article itself notes, &quot;Sensitive information about troubles with the nation's foremost air-defense fighter is emerging in the midst of a fight between the Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress over whether the program should be halted next year at 187 planes….&quot;.  Since the SecDef himself is against more F-22s, anonymous material coming out of DoD that gives support to his preference should be taken with eyes fully open.

:I would also like to point out that in the sentence reading, &quot;However, the ''Washington Post'' reported the aircraft skin is vulnerable to rain and abrasion, which partly accounts for the average flight time of 1.7 hours before critical failure&quot; the last clause is misleading; in fact, it's [[WP:NOR|original research]] in that it draws two different WaPo sources together for an original conclusion.  The ''Post'' article mentions the skin sensitivity issue and attributes it to a variety of sources (cf. that article's 2nd para.).  The portion about 1.7 average hours flying time between critical failures comes from – as WaPo expressly points out – &quot;a ''Defense Department critic of the plane'' who is not authorized to speak on the record&quot; [emphasis added].  That source does not appear to have provided any substantiating evidence, so it's just his say-so, as an F-22 opponent.  We also don't know what kind of &quot;critical failure&quot; it is (e.g., mission-critical or any failure at all), or whether his figure is from early in the program or recent.  Frankly, if we are to keep it, we should find a better, more reliable source than a passing-along of hearsay by an admittedly biased and safely anonymous individual.

::Finally an editor I can have a discussion with.  I glanced at your talk page, edit history and such. Before I say anything else, I would like to state that I too am a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineer (currently completing my last year of schooling, I will sit for the EIT exam this coming spring). Given my experience in the field and given your edit history it is readily apparent that you either work in the Aerospace industry or for a subcontractor that does work in that industry. You present a specific and unique viewpoint on this matter.  The problem is that you assume that your view point is the only view point. More background for me, I am a four year high school debator, and have also spent many, many hours pouring over argumentation and logic.  Yes that background is important.

::The sources you claim that are &quot;unbiased&quot; come directly from industry groups that make parts for the plane. That in and of itself presents a clear conflict of interest as those groups have a direct financial incentive to convince people that this plane is needed. You attack as &quot;biased&quot; every single source that disagrees with that industry assessment. For an FYI, the WaPo, NYTimes both maintain massive editorial staff whose sole purpose is to fact check their reporters and sources, certainly they slip up every now and then but no one is perfect. Flagrantly biased sources such as the Citizens Against Government Waste and The Nation represent biased sources, but on opposite sides of the US ideological spectrum. We have a truely unbiased source (Sec Gates), a liberal biased source (The Nation), a conservative biased source (Citizens Against Government Waste) and two of the world's leading newspapers (WaPo and NYTimes) all coming out against this project.

::::&quot;Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view.

:::::@ EricLeFevre: Yes, I am an aerospace engineer with three decades of experience, having worked with two major defense aerospace firms, for the U.S. Air Force, and as a consultant to the DoD (on a non-aerospace but systems-engineering-related program.)  My primary responsibility these days is to sift through extensive, incomplete, conflicting, partially mal-informed, heavily politicized, and marketeer-spun material to determine &quot;ground truth&quot; and to identify and project the impacts of long-term trends in the global defense aerospace sector.  So, while I did not participate on a debate team during my school years, I am nevertheless very experienced in sifting through bias and minimizing its footprint in my analyses.  As for the F-22 particularly, whether the program is extended or curtailed at 187 makes no difference to me and I expect the outcome will have no impact on me.  What ''is'' important to me here is that the edit warring cease and a consensual and NPOV outcome is reached.

:::::That said, I do have to point out that the strawman against which your polemic your polemic is addressed bears no relation to what have written in this thread.  It is, for instance, your own – boldly incorrect – assumption that &quot;[I] assume that [my] view point is the only view point.&quot; You obviously do not know me and are unfamiliar with my body of work on Wikipedia.  I do think, though, that I can fairly claim that I have greater expertise than the average Wikipedian in those area in which I am a subject-matter expert.  [You will find out eventually, though, that the average Wikipedian does not hold experts in awe – nor should they.]

:::::To address your other specific points succinctly,

:::::* Nowhere in this thread have I identified &quot;sources [I] claim that are 'unbiased'&quot;, much less any that &quot;come directly from industry groups that make parts for the plane.&quot; 
:::::* I have nowhere &quot;attack[ed] as 'biased' every single source that disagrees with that industry assessment.&quot;  That would take a lengthy tome, indeed, were I even slightly interested in writing one.  What I objected to was that the proposed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F-22_Raptor&amp;diff=303591316&amp;oldid=303591034 Criticism section] contains ''only'' presentations of material from opponents of continued F-22 production.  [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] is not about removing bias, but rather presenting both (or all notable) sides' POVs.  Yes, opposition to the F-22 comes from organizations or individuals with a wide range of positions along the political spectrum – but the same is true of its supporters!  Adding a section composed solely of &quot;anti-F-22&quot;-biased views is not made neutral because its proponents are bipartisan ''politically''.  That is why several editors here have, not incorrectly, disparaged the proposed (unbalanced) section as POV-pushing.

::@ Falcon8765:  The issue is not one of whether or not the ''Washington Post'' is a credible, responsible, and reliable source – it is.  Nonetheless, that does not excuse us from responsibly handling material sourced from it.  Are news articles, op-eds and advertisements all equally reliable sources (per [[WP:RS|Wikipedia's definitions]] of it)?  Obviously not.  One of the things that makes WaPo reliable is that they provide information on the quality and reliability of their sources.  One of the WaPo articles I addressed earlier uses a DoD source that WaPo was required to keep anonymous.  Well, that could be anyone from the janitor to the SecDef himself.  We don't know.  But the journalist who wrote the article made clear that the source was an &quot;F-22 critic&quot;; to wit, it identified his bias, which is the responsible thing for a journalist to do.  To the intelligent reader, it's a warning to treat the source's claims cautiously – which is what responsible Wikipedia editors should do.  If the blogs and personal websites of known individuals are not considered reliable sources for Wikipedia, then how can an anonymous source with a known agenda but without any hard evidence be more reliable source than they?  That is one of the matters that is at dispute here.  [[User:Askari Mark|Askari Mark]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Askari Mark|(Talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:29, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

:::While op-ed material from WaPo, NYT, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, etc. may not be &quot;reliable,&quot; the news reporting in these publications is distinct from the opinion pieces as per [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#News_organizations]].

== If we had a F-22 vs F-35 page ==

Should such a page exist I'd list out the various factors from all the sources every which way.

For example on SEAD we have supercruise against time sensitive targets as an advantage for the F-22 vs the F-35's ability to track launchers as they fire (much better IR) and instantly strike back. (DEAD SAMs).

Both platforms lack the ability to stealthily carry the [[AARGM]] so there is a capability gap until we get some sort of super AMRAAM upgrade. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 00:57, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

All that's needed is more on the Air Dominance role of the F-22.  The F-35A/C does not have any special advantage in BVR combat over 4 and 4.5 gen fighters except for its stealth characteristics, which are compramised when carrying external stores.  Sensor fusion is helpful when there are other workloads, but on the offensive a conventional fighter pilot will not be any slower launching on targets in a MIG-29 assuming his systems have already detected targets.  When it is all the pilot is focused on and he/she is well-trained, sensor fusion is a luxury, allowing less concentration, even laziness.  Nice, but doesn't necessarily win the fight.  Most of the research on JSF's air combat effectiveness is based on dogfighting, but the fact is even a Harrier will beat most aircraft in a dogfight.  Removing the VTOL, the F-35 is only as effective as the pilot and the weapons he's got in a close-in fight.  And if both sides have off-boresight, they might as well eject after launching in the merge.  Because they'll both be dead otherwise.  The F-22 cruises at high altitude, very fast, has more range, and thus the kenematics of its medium range missiles are greatly enhanced.  U.S. AAM technologies have ALWAYS trailed the Russians.  The whole point of the F-22 was to allow us to use (in some ways inferior) AMRAAMs and still beat top-line MIG and SU fighters of the future.  The fact that the F-35 is an attack aircraft that can fill an air superiority role with a small loadout does not nullify that it is NOT air dominance capable against any potential future air threat.  Now, 187 aircraft is no small potatoes, but this article and the F-35's when taken together are making biased and unsubstantiated cases that F-22's are not a prudent thing to have around at all.

And do any of you have a clue how the Nazis started out, with anti-western indoctrination youth camps?  Putin's been pulling the same stuff.  A whole generation of brown shirts for the 21st century.  And he created a new position just so he'd stay in the top leadership of his country.  Scary stuff.  Now the Russian navy has proved it can still deploy its subs all the way to the U.S.  Rumsfeld said, &quot;you don't fight with the military you want, you fight with the military you have.&quot;  Well, what you're going to have in the future is decided first in the past and present.  And there's something of a conflict of interest, you have to admit, in having a former DCI put in charge of the military and saying technology is less important than HUMINT.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.178.139.76|66.178.139.76]] ([[User talk:66.178.139.76|talk]]) 22:28, 9 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:F-35 has a few other tricks during a BvR fight, not to say that stealth isn't a major factor(Its a HUGE factor), the F-35's avionics suite is second only to that of the raptor. The range for example matches or excels that of the latest Eagle. As for WvR, the trick the F-35 has is the capability to use DAS to acquire, and fire at any target, in any direction, thus, negating the need to try to out turn the other. These are Huge advantages over any 4.5th generation fighter. F-35 doesn't just have off bore sight capability, but rather one that fully covers all directions.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/136.159.72.2|136.159.72.2]] ([[User talk:136.159.72.2|talk]]) 15:26, 21 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== People editing are confused between the F-22's possible future and current Mission capabilities ==

Just because the F-35 in the future will be a great plane, does not mean the F-22 does not have an useful mission now. This is a article about the F-22. Why are Editors bringing in information about a future F-35 plane and future modifications to the F-22 to prove that the F-22 is currently useless currently now? There are numerous articles that speak about that the **CURRENT** capabilities of the F-22 are useful in Air-Ground combat. Surely, the Air-Ground capabilities will be improved in the future but they are sufficient **NOW** for the Israeli's to want them given **THEIR** knowledge of when they will take deliver of the **F-35**. Why do editors attempt to make some convoluted argument that the future deliver of the F-35 somehow makes the current model of the F-22 useless when this is not supported by the facts. It's very frustrating that editors are trying to show that the F-22 has no useful mission in todays current Political climate even when this is not supported logically by the facts. I can only image they have some dog in this hunt. [[User:Doug rosenberg|Doug rosenberg]] ([[User talk:Doug rosenberg|talk]]) 05:54, 27 September 2009 (UTC)
:The problem is finding missions where the current F-22 can actually be useful.  If the entire mission profile is BVR a2a then the Raptor is the best choice.  Once you go hunting for ground targets it gets a lot trickier.  Currently the F-22 can not see a S-300 launcher before it turns on its radar and it's ability to strike back in a stealth configuration is limited to a pair of unguided half-ton bombs, because it has no SAR, FLIR or designator.

:This entire picture changes with the F-35 that can spot and designate targets on the ground and plink them from a long ways off using the [[AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon]] (internal stealthy carry on all except for the F-35B).  Not to mention that the F-35A has a longer range on internal fuel.

:I agree with you. The F-22's air-ground ability is kind of an afterthought once they figured out they won't be in dog fights with the Soviets. It's not ideal but it may be the only possible tool for certain missions now. I personally don't think Israel will strike Iran since they don't have the bunker buster technology to do enough damage to the Iranian nuclear bomb development effort even if they can evade the S-300. So I think the argument is a little specious. It will be interesting to see what the US uses if and when they have to attack Iran. As to to the limitations of the F-22 in Air to Surface, I think it would be interesting for you to expand upon the limitations of the F-22 in Air to Surface.[[User:Doug rosenberg|Doug rosenberg]] ([[User talk:Doug rosenberg|talk]]) 22:40, 27 September 2009 (UTC) And if you want to Nuke a country you would just use a missile.[[User:Doug rosenberg|Doug rosenberg]] ([[User talk:Doug rosenberg|talk]]) 23:05, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

== Developed Into? ==

Is it common practice to list theoretical (un-designed, un-built) aircraft in the &quot;developed into&quot; field?

I would say the F-16 was &quot;developed into&quot; the F-16XL because a test article was built and flown.

-Nice try but these &quot;shock diamonds&quot; do not come out in such a tint of purple as the one in the picture. The only &quot;shock diamond&quot; I found that was close to that tint was from a nitrogen plasma jet (which the f-22 doesn't have). And this &quot;indium-tin oxide&quot; that was said to give the raptor a gold tint is also wrong. Indium-tin oxide can appear pale-yellow, yellow-green or even gray, the picture showed it as a strong goldish/yellow orange color. Plus no other picture has the cockpit in that color, all other pics of the f-22 have it as see-through glass (with a glare of yellow when shined in the sun, but not competelty gold as in the main image).--[[User:Brainiack16|Brainiack16]] ([[User talk:Brainiack16|talk]]) 02:28, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

:::(I indented your comment for neatness) I think trying to analyze the color of exhaust plume is a bit silly. On my uncalibrated LCD monitor, the color isn't very purple. Maybe your monitor is more saturated or or mine is undersaturated. Or maybe the deep blue of the sky is affecting the apparent color of the photo. Or maybe the photographer increased the blue saturation level in photoshop to give you that nice sky, and it had the unintended side effect of making the exhaust purple-ish.

Where on earth are you self-appointed analysts getting any of this nonsense from? The F-22 hasn't set foot in a warzone or for that matter flown much outside of the United States.

I sincerely doubt it has completed CAP's near Russian territory or purposely tried to evaluate it's stealth characteristics by flying near enemy S2A sites.
The USAF are still ironing out the wrinkles in the F-22's stealth suite, and trying to overcome it's very limited flight duration in poor weather or at high speed (which deforms/erodes the RCS-reducing contours and the radar-absorbing coating; requiring significantly costly maintenance to restore).

I don't think they'd throw the Raptor into harm's way without being sincerely sure it would be able to evade detection.

Please, '''stop the speculation''', there's enough of that crap as it is.

Also for your information, the specific knowledge of which countries possess the S-300 or any of its variants (SA-10, SA-12, SA-20) is '''extremely sketchy''' at best and there is no confirmation Syria are fielding the system. Only that they announced their intention to purchase it at sometime.

And finally the S-300's/400's/500's target acquisition and early warning radars (NATO reporting names: FLAP LID &amp; TIN SHIELD) are some of the most potent &amp; advanced S2A radars in the world. They do have extensive capability to detect low-observable and reduced-RCS aircraft at range.

If the term F-22E pops up in a reliable source then you can discount it as Goon's latest delusion.

Following the example of a very successful and cost-effective development of the F-15E from the F-15A&amp;C, the F-22A needs to be developed along the lines of the Strike Eagle – a two-place, much enhanced “F-22E” fighter with the rear seat Weapons System Officer monitoring sensor feeds, advising the pilot and managing the passive and active terminal countermeasures – and, yes, it must have the agility and persistence to overmatch both the PAK-FA and the Su-35S.

== Software &quot;Glitch&quot; Unverifiable? ==

The following quote (3rd para. of [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor#Service_history]]) seems to be largely unsupported by the cite given [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123041567(#141)] &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;141.

{{cquote|While attempting its first overseas deployment to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, on 11 February 2007, a group of six Raptors flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii experienced multiple computer crashes coincident with their crossing of the 180th meridian of longitude (the International Date Line). The computer failures included at least navigation (completely lost) and communication. The fighters were able to return to Hawaii by following their tankers in good weather. The error was fixed within 48 hours and the F-22s continued their journey to Kadena.&lt;sup&gt;[141]&lt;/sup&gt;}} 
All the ''source'' says about the issue is:
{{cquote|While en route, a software issue affecting the aircraft's navigation system was discovered Feb. 11 causing the aircraft to return to Hickam. The issue was corrected and the aircraft continued on to Kadena.}}

The article also mentions &quot;Ten&quot; (source says 6) F-22 Raptors.

The interesting thing is I ''have heard'' of such a bug in a USAF aircraft, but as I recall (unverifiable!), it was discovered in testing before practical application of the software.

The article states &quot;... and the development of the cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in calls to end F-22 production.&quot; In the description of the F-35 it is stated that the production cost of the F-35 is in fact higher than the one of the F-22.

:The joy of mass production is that production costs suffer from vast [[Economies of scale]] which is especially true with the F-35 as tools are being built to build massive numbers of F-35s.  By counting these tool costs in addition to the current costs of building F-35s by hand you get to a higher cost than the last few F-22s.  The F-35 costs continue to drop year after year and will soon be half or less of the F-22s.  The other issue which is not mentioned is that the F-35 is built to be maintained and so will require vastly lower operating costs than the B-2s and F-22As that take so much loving care to fly.

== ADA Operating System ==

Jeff, you reverted my F-22 edit which clarified the problem with the ADA operating system as per the cited reference at sldinfo.com. You said Ada is a DoD programming language. That's true, but that's not what Michael Wynne said in his article about the problems with the F-22 development program. He said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because of a nagging fear of being hostage to an industrial solution, the Defense Department specified in detail its own operating system, called ADA...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I acknowledge your expertise in the industry, but can you please explain how you go from &quot;ADA operating system&quot; to &quot;Ada programming language&quot;? Or are you asserting that Wynne was incorrect in his article? Because unless I'm missing some exotic nuance, they're completely different things.

::Concur totally. In my opinion, the &quot;Fighter generation&quot; stuff is next to useless in real-world analysis, being suitible only for marketing hype and fanboyish nationalism. Development of the what became the F-22 (the ATF program) was actually begun before the Typhoon itself. Even more, the F-22's stealth advantages have not be &quot;tried by fire&quot;, so we really don't know how effective it really is. That said, it's still a good airframe/system. It's certainly better in the short run than the F-35 &quot;Aardvark II&quot; (a reference to one of [[Robert McNamara]]'s many follies, the &quot;multi-role&quot; F-111), which really looks like it will at least as expensive as the F-22 by the time it enters production. And the funny thing is that Japan is willing to buy the F-22 no matter the cost, and such a sale would lower the production price.

:::Agreed that the fighter generation stuff is next to worthless. Honestly, I with they would go away, just to save us the headaches on wikipedia.

The decision process to end the F-22 production began in 2006, and its chief champion was SecDef Gates, who was originally a Pres. Bush appointee. Gates and the Joint Chiefs both wanted to end F-22 production to free up money for F-35 and other upcoming programs. Obama got a lot of press for ending F-22 production because Gates reccomended (and Obama threatened) vetoing the approps bill if LockMart lobbied their way into adding it back to the budget (See Boeing and the C-17 for a similar situation), but Obama didn't start the process.

Agree strongly with BilCat. The comparable list should be there to illustrate what might be in the air at the same time, doing a broadly similar job, on the same side, on the opposing side, or neutral. The facts (hopefully) in those articles should make it clear how comparable planes are, and importantly make it clear to what degree one can really know and to what degree of generality. Incidentally this article just suggests that the F-22 is invincible, which I suspect was the intention. Almost makes me WANT some afghan to shoot one down with a catapulted rock in the fanblades ;). In reality however, it might get sand in the gearbox like those helicopters did in the desert.

It come to my attention, by someone that responded to a bloggpost, that the F-22 is short legged (especially considered the substantial fuel load).

[[User:Wikinegern|Wikinegern]] ([[User talk:Wikinegern|talk]]) 11:31, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

:Range doing what and with what load?  Do you have a change in the way the performance blocks are formatted or the terms used in them?  Also different aircraft are designed for different missions and so state their ranges for their own missions so it's difficult to compare ranges between aircraft.

[[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 18:26, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

::The only way that the F-22 has limited range is from supercruise, which makes it seem like it's short legged, but really, it's trading endurance for energy (speed/maneuverability).

The F-22 carries 18,000 lb fuel internally while the F-35A has 480 more lb fuel and its one engine burns less fuel than the two engines on the F-22 (and the F-35A has a much lower empty weight to drag around). [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 17:47, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

The Variant section should look like this:

* '''[[Lockheed YF-22|YF-22A]]''' - annotation.
* '''F-22A''' - F/A-22A from (200?-0?), single-seat, annotation.
* '''F-22B''' - planned two-seat version, cancelled to save costs in 199?.

;Derivitives
* '''FB-22''' - annotation.

== The F-35 is more versatile ==

In response to the latest Koppian edit I just undid: A short list of things the F-35 can do, that the F-22 can not.

* The F-35 can track and engage targets outside of a narrow 120 degree arc and with sensors other than just active radar.  (The F-22 isn't a fighter, it's an interceptor and had best stay out of dogfights with HOBS equipped fighters like the PAK-FA and F-35.)

* The F-35 can carry a much wider selection of weapons internally, including the one-ton bombs that will not fit inside the F-22.

* The F-35 B and Cs can deploy from the seas, while the F-22 is limited to airfields with long runways, greatly limiting the role of the F-22 in projected conflicts with China.

* The F-35 has MADL built in and this has been delayed yet again on the F-22.  The result is that the F-35 gets to whisper to the B-2, and the F-22 does not.

And so on.  The F-35 is more versatile, but the F-22 does have a few &quot;silver bullet&quot; capabilities that make it a better interceptor, if not multirole fighter.  [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 17:11, 10 October 2010 (UTC)

One of your refs is from a few years before the F-22 was cancelled and after reading both other sources I see very little connection to how the plane being built all over the nation was a killing point.  The F-22 had always been excessively expensive and the USAF (along with congress for that matter) had no problem with that.  The pressure to terminate production came almost exclusively from the executive branch.  Most jets have parts that are built in several different locations (how many people are supposed to be building the new 787?)

: Remember the Common Integrated Processor (CIP) design for the F-22 Raptor advanced tactical fighter? It was developed two decades ago by what was then Hughes Aircraft (bought later by Raytheon), and was based on the Intel 80960 processor. Hughes promoted the CIP as an open-systems computer, but anyone who took a look at it quickly realized that Hughes held the keys to the architecture, and no third-party suppliers could participate in the CIP without the approval and support of Hughes.

This article was used to show the F-22's high crash rate in comparison to other fighters in the USAF inventory, but there is one flaw in the article that makes it rather questionable.  
:&quot;According to the latest statistics provided by the Air Force, which go through 2009, the F-22 since being fielded has suffered six Class A accidents -- accidents that result in more than $1 million in damage -- since entering the inventory.&quot;
Since no less than two aircraft have been completely destroyed in crashes so far how does the total result in &quot;more than $1 million&quot;?  The aircraft are over $150 million a pop and considering the overall cost of the F-22 program $1 million isn't even something worth writing about.

Although I must congratulate the author on an excellent and concise description of the F-22 I must disagree with the figure for empty weight.

The real empty weight according to Jane's &quot;all the world's aircraft&quot; is 14,365kg (31,670lb).

:Due to its supercruise ability, the F-22 is capable of covering long distances in regions like the Arctic Ocean, the continental U.S., the Western Pacific, and the Persian Gulf with supersonic flight without the need to engage afterburners.

Note that they do not ref this paragraph because it has no connection to reality.  The F-35 has a greater range than the F-22 when both aircraft are subsonic and engaging in supercruise reduces the range of the F-22. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 05:52, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:::Not sure what you mean.  The optimal cruise altitudes and optimal cruise speeds of Raptor are above FL400 and above mach 1.2 significantly below mil power.  That's the whole point of the fixed inlets, low drag (without the external hardpoints), and high-surface area lifting body-like design.  You can easily go over FL500 and mach 1.5 with power potential to spare on dry thrust, but then you're getting into progressively less efficient fuel consumption if you're worried about extreme range without refueling.  Ultimate capabilities are entirely limited by fuel efficiency and thermal/wear concerns on the airframe and engine outlets.  Afterburner is entirely intended for acceleration (linear and angular) and rapid climbing to cruise altitude.

The US Military needs at least 750 F-22 for it to destroy the Chinese Airforce. The F-35 should only be ground attack, IT ONLY HAS 2 MISSILES FOR GOD'S SAKE. There should be about 500 hundred F-35 and 1000 improved Raptors, or the US will suffer a crushing defeat by the Chinese like Japan during WW2. The F-22 should have a HMD, better radar, more and better weapons and more combat range and speed.

::There have been three (or more) claims by China of shooting down F-22s.

Presumably some F/A-18s might have been damaged by enemy weapon's fire, combat losses may count against, a lack of suppliers or a simple lack of manhours/manpower onboard a carrier to simply service the every demand the fleet had; I'm worried this isn't comparing like for like. Surely it would make sense to compare a Super Hornet's early peacetime mission capable rate with the Raptor's peacetime rate; where the service conditions are at least not coming under the pressures of war verses the leisures of homeland security. Have I looked too deeply into this? [[User:Kyteto|Kyteto]] ([[User talk:Kyteto|talk]]) 23:15, 24 September 2011 (UTC)

For these training missions, the F-22As flew only within visual range 1 vs 1 BFM (Basic Fighter Manoeuvring) sorties, and did so carrying under-wing fuel tanks, and with radar reflectors fitted, preventing opponents from seeing how ‘stealthy’ the F-22 is in operational configuration, or from experiencing the F-22’s AN/APG-77 radar and highly advanced AN/ALR-94 passive receiver system.

Here is a debunking of these points. 

* The F-22 has not been placed in combat because it is an air superiority fighter, and the USA has not had an enemy with aircraft since 2003. So unless you want it to shoot AMRAMMs at the ground, of COURSE it's not going to be in combat. As for the recent crash, that is one incident. The F-22 has had almost 100,000 hours of flight, so how the hell does one incident with the OBOGS mean it &quot;doesn't work&quot;?

* You don't know whether or not it WAS his fault. And also, they DID ground the fleet for quite a long time, and have worked to fix any problems with the OBOGS.

* $150 million per aircraft, not $200 million. It is not a &quot;hangar queen&quot;, it has nearly 100,000 flight hours (at latest source), and its maintenance per flight hour has been reduced from 30 hours in 2005 to 10.5 hours in 2009, which exceeds the 12 hour requirement. As for cost as a whole, the aircraft is very expensive yes, but its also extremely capable.

== Speed is Stealth ==
http://www.dvidshub.net/news/88337/bird-prey-bulldogs-accept-delivery-last-raptor
&quot;In the anti-access, area-denial role, altitude and airspeed are some of the keys to survivability when you start talking about going against very robust surface-to-air missile systems. The higher you are and the faster you are, the better your stealth works. That has been proven.&quot;

:What he is not saying here is that the F-22 is harder to pick up on radar because it operates at altitude (increasing the distance from ground radars) and at speed (decreasing the time the radars have to track it). However this pushes the F-22 up into a flight regime that other fighters do not operate in, exposing the pilots to conditions that the USAF has not prepared them for. Unless we can find a ref for this, it's all OR and all we could report is that Speed is Armor for these battlecruisers of the skies.

== Radar Cross Section ==
There is a table In paragraph &quot;2.5 Stealth&quot; comparing the radar cross sections of various aircraft to the F-22. It states that the radar cross section of the Typhoon is around 1 m². According to the German Typhoon article on wikipedia, the radar cross section of the Typhoon is around 0.05 to 0.1 m². This is due to the use of radar absorbant material on key radar reflectors and design measures such as jet inlets that conceal the front of the jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. The source for this information is the Japanese aircraft magazine J-Wings, in particular &quot;J-WINGS」 2010年08月号 イカロス出版 (J-WINGS 08/2010, Ikaros Publications)&quot;. That's more than a magnitude lower than the figure published here. So I think this should be corrected.[[Special:Contributions/77.4.82.138|77.4.82.138]] ([[User talk:77.4.82.138|talk]]) 12:41, 29 July 2012 (UTC)

We are not talking about the radar cross section of the F-22, we are talking about the radar cross section of the Typhoon. The first production model of the typhoon was delivered at two to three years after the cited book was published. Furthermore, we have an additional source, a Japanese flight Journal that discloses contradictory information. Therefore, the information is not reliable. Therefore, I am going to revert the revert.

:To be honest, the whole table should be thrown out. It was rejected from the Eurofighter Typhoon article earlier in the year, due to controversies over the validitity of the source's ability to know the information they claim to have, and an arguement was made that it is effectively an instance of [[WP:Synth]] due to it comparing statistics that none of the original sources compared to create a synthetic comparison. After being chucked out on the Typhoon page, it shortly enough emerged here. To be consistent, it either shouldn't have been removed from the Typhoon article, or it shouldn't have been added to this one.

No, the Eurofighter Typhoon defintely did not fly in the 90s. There were experimental aircraft flying, which were under developement. Type acceptance of the EFA was achieved in June 2003. The first series production aircraft was delivered in August 2003. Here is the source: http://www.eurofighter.com/eurofighter-typhoon/chronology/jumper/chronology-2003.html. Prior to that the plane was still in developement. I have cited my source previously, I don't have to repeat myself. This is an article about the F-22 and not the typhoon.

It's peacocking. First RCS is a function and not a number, and second the RCS &quot;number&quot; gives a very misleading feel for performance. A causal reader might assume that stealth that is &quot;twice as good&quot; would allow a fighter to only be detected at half the range. This requires an RCS that isn't halved, but instead divided by a factor of 16. Putting this table in the RCS article itself would at least expose the reader to the math behind the science. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 09:37, 31 July 2012 (UTC)

The first thing that happens here is an edit war: I would like to ask all the people who want the table to be included to explain the following: 
1.How did the author know about the radar cross section in 2001, when the first production plane was delivered in 2003? 

2.The radar cross section is a function, it depends on the angle of view and the frequency of the radiation. For which radar frequencies and angles of view do the numbers stand for?

3. Why is it that a renown Japanes aircraft magazine reprots a completely different figure für the Typhoon viewed from the front?

*'''Oppose'''. Not just in this case, but in general. The current title follows the standard format of ''manufacturer-designation-name'' used by WikiProject Aircraft for all aircraft articles: see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Aviation/Style guide#Aircraft|here]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/page content#Name|here]], and especially [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (aircraft)|here]]. It seems to be a good, reasonably complete, and unambiguous format, without being overly long, and it gives the reader the aircraft's full name at a glance. Since it also helps to disambiguate designations that have been used repeatedly, of which there are a number in the history of U.S. military aircraft, it gives all aircraft article titles a consistent form, without needing special cases to disambiguate aircraft where the designation has been reused. Shorter forms which allow readers to quickly find the proper article can easily be handled with redirects, as they are at present. As for your objections that this does not follow Wikipedia's title [[WP:CRITERIA|criteria]], you should read that section more carefully. Conciseness is only one of several characteristics listed, and the section states &quot;These should be seen as goals, not as rules&quot; and &quot;When titling articles in specific fields, or with respect to particular problems, there is often previous consensus that can be used as a precedent. Look to the guideline pages referenced.&quot; For this project the consensus has been to use the current title form, a consensus that has been heavily discussed (see [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (aircraft)|here]]) and which I would continue to support. --[[User:Colin Douglas Howell|Colin Douglas Howell]] ([[User talk:Colin Douglas Howell|talk]]) 22:49, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I would draw an analogy with articles on biological subjects, where the formal Latin names are used, eg ''Ranunculus repens'': It might be commonly called a creeping buttercup, but ''Ranunculus repens'' is its proper name, &amp; the accepted article name.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 22:58, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

We moved the Lockheed articles to the new title format (M/D/N) first to give other users a chance to respond to the proposed naming convention revision. There was no opposition at that time, so the new conventions were implemented for all aircraft articles soon after.

:What is truly misleading here is the small sample of published works you've evidently consulted, primarily if not exclsively those available on the internet. The vast majority of printed aviation encyclopedias and reference works use the M-D-N format for lisitng the entries on individual aircraft. I have several dozen books on aviation published over the past 35 years, and then majortiy of them use this format. These are books by leading authors in the aviation consuimer-reference field, including [[Bill Gunston]], Mike Spick, Bill Yenne, David Donald, David Mondey, and several of Jane's print works. I am sure that other editors here have books going back even further than that. A lot of these books have been available in libraries and book stores for many years. Since WP is a reference work writ large, it was natural for the editors of WP aircraft articles to chose to put the manufacturer first in the titles. Futher, many of the fan sites on the internet also use this format.

:So your earlier claim that &quot;The current aircraft naming conventions allows Wiki to designate aircraft by names no one else has ever called them&quot; is clearly inaccurate.

:Per [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Explicit conventions]], &quot;This practice of using specialized names is often controversial, and should not be adopted unless it produces clear benefits outweighing the use of common names; when it is, the article titles adopted should follow a ''neutral and common convention specific to that subject domain'', and otherwise adhere to the general principles for titling articles on Wikipedia.&quot; (Italics mine.) The &quot;clear benefits&quot; here are a consistent naming format across all aircraft articles that matches that found in the majority of printed reference works, and so would be familiar to readers with even a basic knowledge of aviation. As to readers with no such knowledge, redirects are avalable to point them to the correct articles. Further, after reading several aircraft articles, an average reader should have clear idea of how the WP aircraft articles are titled, and as it's a fairly intuitive format, should be able to find other aircraft articles quite easily, especially with redirects. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 20:23, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

Less than a year after getting &quot;rainbow enhanced&quot;, the USAF took a critical look at their clothing and narrowed down the problem to the vests.

So my rewrite would go along the lines of...
* The crash
* Problem determined
* Alternative paths tried
* Vests fingered
* Current restrictions
* Fixing and testing vest and other fixes and plan to lift altitude restrictions.

I would leave minimal references in other sections (such as cockpit) that largely just pointed to the operational problems section.

The F-22A is a very solidly built aircraft (to handle thrust vectoring) and it has that thick layer of spray-on-stealth that the aluminum F-15 doesn't.

The small armament is quite odd, though. The 500 lb would fit what is known as Taxi fuel (TF) and Take Off fuel (TOF) for civilian airline designs. It should be enough for taxiing, high speed afterburner start, and military power maximum climbing up to 37,000 ft within a minute and leveling to operational altitude. It may be enough for afterburning all the way, but I wouldn't be so sure. In any case it makes no sense for any flight configuration to have less than 50% fuel.

The growth is a result of design teams requesting additional weight budgets to meet requirements such as reliability, survivability and observability. The USAF says that it is &quot;...trying to hold the line on affordability&quot; and wants to trade weight against cost and performance.

::Keep in mind this statement refers to design Configuration 645 for the first production F-22 EMD (from Code one Magazine 1998). By now it may differ somewhat albeit not that terrible off. Actually, all released information prior to 1998 are quite accurate and not much censored. Since then it appears censorship kicked in. And since the production F-22 has higher performance than the YF-22 most YF-22 performance values still apply, except fuel and max. possible velocity. There's only a little unknown regarding wet empty weight which is empty weight plus oils, lubricants etc. Although, it's a given we don't really know for sure if the empty weight stated is really the empty weight. Official information may not lie but the wording may be misleading.

::As to the load weight calculation in the article, it certainly is wrong. The load weight calculates by adding the pylons (if any), the weapons, the launchers and racks for the weapons (if any), '''unlinked''' cannon ammo (in this case the linking is already part of the cannon magazine system), fuel (+ fuel additions), oil lubricants, hydraulics, coolants, and pilot. Like that I would get for A2A with 100% fuel a load of 24757 lb (12 lb error margin) without coolant and empty weight. Added your 31640 lb empty would give 56397 lb. Added max. external load of 21544 lb would give a max loaded weight of 77941 lb. The difference of internal bomb load and missile is just 68 lb (-8 lb error) more. This happens to be within the max 83500 lb given. A discrepancy of 5500 lb which happens to be the missing fuel specified originally (25000 lb). Unless this is wrong the weight problem seems solved.

:There are no other and if it probably won't solve anything due to the information policy. As you have seen there is only a 5,000 lb margin to meet all the load requirements. Further the ATF specification says: &quot;a gross take-off weight of 50,000lbs&quot;. If you use the 43,340 lb as empty weight the A2A take-off weight will end up being 68,187 lb instead of 56,397 which is way over the allowance the Air Force was willing to give in the news article above. It is possible that it's a typo that just so happens to have a leading 4 instead of 1 and lb instead of kg turning 13,340 kg to 43,430 lb.

== F-22 cheaper, more versatile than the F-35 ==
* Moving this section to the end of the talk page. - [[User:Nick Thorne|&lt;font color = &quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;'''Nick Thorne'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Nick Thorne|&lt;font color = &quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''talk''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:11, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

Until today, when I corrected these glaring factual errors, the article was perpetuating the falsehoods that the F-35 is &quot;cheaper&quot; and &quot;more versatile&quot; than the F-22. The reverse is actually true.

The F-22 was always designed and intended to be superior to the F-35 in both air to air and air to ground combat, and that is indeed the case. In air to air combat, the F-22 can carry eight A2A missiles internally, in stealth mode; its high power aperture APG-77 radar is much more powerful than the F-35's APG-81; and it is far superior kinematically and aerodynamically with a top speed of Mach 2.25, a top supercruise speed of Mach 1.82, and a combat ceiling of 65,000 feet, versus the F-35's meager top speed of 1.61 (on afterburner) and combat ceiling of 43,000 feet. In fact, on dry thrust the F-22 outperforms the F-35 by a good margin. Moreover, the F-22 is Very Low Observable from all aspects, while the F-35 is VLO only from the front and only in the S/X-band.

In A2G combat, the F-22 is also superior to the F-35. Not only is it VLO from all aspects across a much broader range of radar bands than the F-35 (whose deeply sculpted lower fuselage and classic engine exhaust nozzle make for splendid radar wave returns), it (the F-22) can defeat most air defense systems by kinematics alone, due to its high speed and combat ceiling. It's too fast and flies too high for most radar to detect it. The F-35, by contrast, cannot rely on kinematics to evade radar, and if spotted from below or the rear, would be easily detected. Furthermore, on an A2G mission, both aircraft can carry 8 Small Diameter Bombs, but the F-22 (as Wikipedia's article on the subject admits) can also concurrently carry four A2A missiles for self defense internally.

More on the F-35's decisive inferiority in both A2A and A2G combat is available [http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-2008-08.html here] and [http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-2009-01.html here].

The F-22 is now also cheaper than the F-35, costing only $150 mn compared to the cost of all three F-35 variants, which is yet to be finally determined but is currently at ca. $200 mn per copy, for all F-35 variants, per Wikipedia's own page on the F-35 program. As the F-35 experiences further cost overruns and delays, the unit cost of an F-35 will go up, not down.

In short, the assertion that the F-35 was &quot;cheaper and more versatile&quot; than the F-22 was and is totally incorrect.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.70.109.30|89.70.109.30]] ([[User talk:89.70.109.30|talk]]) 10:06, 1 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The UK govt seems to think the F35 has become way too expensive, and it's no great improvement over the Typhoon.  The place where the F22 would work best is in Europe, particularly in the east. It then counters the newer Russian machines, with apparently very good phased-array radar, and supercruise abilities. The F22 is just a big waste of money sitting around on US soil. The US govt should simply sell the entire F22 fleet/project to the Europeans.[[Special:Contributions/220.244.247.195|220.244.247.195]] ([[User talk:220.244.247.195|talk]]) 00:27, 16 January 2013 (UTC)

== [[Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Operational_issues|Operational issues]] sub-section rewrite? ==
I suggest that the article subsection [[Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Operational_issues|Operational issues]] be summarized and then perhaps split off into a separate article, perhaps one that is somewhat differently formatted to allow the information to be more visually accessible and appealing, as right now it's just a block/mass/wall of monolithic text. The info is important, no doubt, especially the operational issues as covered by CBS 60min w/ the whistle-blower claims, etc., but I think this sub-section could be better rendered for the readers' benefit. I'd like to hear from others though as to their thoughts on the matter. Thanks. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.15em 0.15em 0.1em&quot;&gt;[[User:Joep01|joepa]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.25em 0.25em 0.12em&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Joep01|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20:35, 21 January 2013 (UTC)

:My suggestion is to rewrite from hindsight and cover the following:

*Initial design choices and review that foreshadowed the problem.
*The incidents that finally got the ball rolling.
*Reactions by pilots and others.
*The partial fixes to date and the plans going forwards.

::I agree. The best thing to do is a rewrite. There is probably enough information to warrant having a sub-article, which could be summed-up here in the parent article. However, the style used in that section is all wrong for an encyclopedia. (Note: This is only meant as constructive criticism.) The section is written like a series of excerpts from newspaper article, with very little coherency, except the long string of dates linking everything together. Unless you're very good at keeping track of numbers, this linear method of explaining makes it very difficult to keep track of exactly what the problems are, and what has-been/is-being done to fix them. Information presented in this manner would be well-suited to a timeline, but not so much for a summary. That's what this section should be about, is a summary of the problems, the tragedies that reesulted, and the solutions (or lack thereof) --in that order.

== Myths, Performance and Analysis ==
Out of interest and to deter wild speculation or guesses, I'm going to give some insights into aeronautics. I could be wrong in some details but the following are mostly basic knowledge. Any aircraft enthusiast should know them already except for some aerodynamic issues. In case you need to look-up refer to the following terms: ''air density, Mach speed, lift force, [[Drag (physics)|drag force]], [[Drag coefficient]], [[Transonic]], [[Shock wave|shock front]], [[Bow shock (aerodynamics)|bow shock]], wave drag, aerodynamic efficiency lift-drag-ratio (L/D)''. I will only explain some. For reading references: Modern Air Combat (1983); U.S. Supersonic Commercial Aircraft: Assessing NASA's High Speed Research; Temperature Issues for a Mach 2.4 High Speed Civil Transport. Further I'm using aeronautic language which means 'miles' are 'nautical miles' or knots and SI units.

Subsonic drag force rises roughly &quot;linear&quot; with the speed. Supersonic drag is roughly normal drag squared. In the transonic area the drag rises dramatically, more than supersonic drag even. That's why for most aircrafts afterburning is needed to break the Mach barrier. One official statement said the YF-22 can do 800 kn max. (Mach 1.2) at sea level. Interestingly, drag becomes &quot;linear&quot; again beyond Mach 1.2. That's why some aircrafts like the Concord can supercruise with normal dry thrust. Air density changes with altitude. At 36000 ft it's only about one-fourth. That's why some people estimate the max speed to be Mach 2.4 for the YF-22. At Mach 2.4 the skin temperature would be 177 °C (350 °F). According to Nasa, only in 2009 are non-foreign materials available that could be used.

However, the wing leading edge sweep was increased to 48° for the production F-22. Aerodynamic efficiency (L/D) virtually dictates that its max speed is reduced to around Mach 2.2 (likely less). The reason being the nose wave drag cone wall touching the wing tip at this speed. It simply will be trouble flying faster. Due to air density Mach 2 can only be achieved around 37000 ft and beyond. As air gets thinner lift gets less which means at higher altitude an aircraft has to fly faster to keep itself aloft. Beyond 37000 ft airspeed stays the same for the same lift despite flying faster. It was stated that the F-22 supercruised at Mach 1.58 at 36000 ft. and afterburned at Mach 1.7 at 30000 ft. Based on air density that would be Mach 2.04 afterburned at 36000 ft. a bit faster than the F-16. 

This is definitely true for a fixed inlet but the F-22 has 'slots and slats' to divert excess air out. It was obviously inspired by the movable guide vanes in the intakes of the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-29]]. This allowed intake air to be regulated to some degree allowing higher speeds.

Mach 2.04/Mach 1.58 squared gives 0.667 as the difference of drag force, hence, engine power between dry thrust and afterburner. However, afterburning is generally and stated to be about 40% more than mil power. Adjusted for military power would give a max supercruise of Mach 1.724. That's about true for most engines, though. At Mach 2.2 the skin temperature would be 153°C (307°F)

Each F119 engine is supplied by an air mass flow of (exactly) 150 kg/s (-1.5 error)(+unknown precision error). [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 21:47, 24 November 2012 (UTC)

:You really do need hard refs for these things. The F-22 (and especially the F-35) are not just software defined aircraft in their internal operations, a large amount of computation has gone into their aerodynamics. [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 23:52, 24 November 2012 (UTC)

::This was an analysis to show the range of what's possible and what's not based on physical laws. There is no need for hard fact other than the references for calculations (Jane's 2004-5). The error margin is near zero but based on released speeds which are of course not true maximums. The real error margin is probably 5-10%. The aerodynamic efficiency, however, is dependent on the form of the aircraft, and is in plain view. Only the real angle of the nose will reveal the finer tweaking, but the error margin is small and won't have that much of an impact. And frankly the maximum possible speed isn't that important or used often other than for running away. By the time it's used there won't be much fuel left, and fuel will be the major factor in sustaining it. In short it can't be used for long. Supercruise on the other hand is more important, but it's not like it's new or unexpected. The F-18/F-16 with missiles can go about Mach 1.8 in interceptor role, only not long of course. The Su-27 has more fuel and can go as fast with afterburner and should be able to give a good chase 1/3 of the way given same fuel. Long enough to use some missiles. Yes, a lot of computations but they were more for maneuvering ability and stealth than speed. [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 03:11, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

::::Actually, Mightyname is quite right. See: Kermode, A.C., ''Mechanics of Flight'', Introduction to Aeronautical Engineering Series, Pittman Publishing Limited, London, 1972. ISBN 0 273 31623 0 pp.371-75. Plenty of discussion there about the relevance of wing planform in supersonic applications, particularly in reference to Mach cones/lines. This will tend to support his conclusions on top speed.[[User:Flanker235|Flanker235]] ([[User talk:Flanker235|talk]]) 06:36, 5 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::Corrected a minor error for drag above. On a side note, most of the official values are partly standard values the Air Force gives for many aircrafts. On another note, due to speed limit engine power isn't as important as for the F-35. However, it is important for acceleration as the recent Red Flag 2012 showed how the better powered Typhoon won the energy battle dog fight. On another note, BMI composite at the time of production was limited to the 250°F range according to numerous papers, although, there were better foreign alternatives according to NASA. [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 13:59, 9 December 2012 (UTC)

::::::Actually, the Typhoon and the F-22 probably have very similar T/W but the Typhoon has an advantage in being a smaller, lighter aircraft to start with so has an inertial advantage. Also, the F-22's likely corner speed would probably be between 330-440 kts (not sure where I read this) while the Typhoon apparently works a bit better at lower speed where it can use its acceleration better. In short, the F-22 is more an energy fighter and the Typhoon more an angles fighter though both perform exceptionally well throughout their respective envelopes.

::::::Did the Typhoons win? Nobody seems know for sure what the score was in Red Flag (this was the unofficial part) because, in theory, nobody was keeping score. I suspect it's classified information anyway, regardless of the score. What is known is that two Typhoons were seen sporting kill marks, one German aircraft - 30+30 - had &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt;.[[User:Flanker235|Flanker235]] ([[User talk:Flanker235|talk]]) 10:31, 13 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::::T/W=acceleration. Inertia is already accounted for by the mass because that's what it is. Saying they have the same T/W while inertia is different is a contradiction. The only difference is for rotation see [[Moment of inertia]]. That's because of torque and the size or distance at which it works is different. Then again the F-22 has vector thrust which should result in a better torque effect. A delta flyer like the Typhoon likely dives (harder to stir up), have higher corner speed, and is unstable. How much better the canards can improve that is unknown. The F-22 was designed to rotate even when it falls with zero speed as has been demonstrated during air shows. Perhaps both are equal in this respect. Corner speeds seem all very similar for most fighters (without any real data available). All in all, the inertia and angle reasoning seems off. The real reason should be a combination of differences in drag and T/W. What we know for sure is that the X-31 beats the F-18 which in turn beats the F-22.

::::::::T/W is a static measure. Wing loading is a static measure. There are static and dynamic stability considerations too. Both can tell you a lot about the aircraft's potential but don't necessarily give you a complete picture, even in combination. There are any number of other things which can be factored in.

::::::::&lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of these factors will contribute to an aircraft's agility. No single factor will be absolute.

::::::::But whatever the case, I was actually referring to the specific example of straight line acceleration. What I was questioning was the ability of the aircraft to accelerate in a straight line, based on inertia. The [[EJ200]] engine, which is about 60% of the weight of the F-22 engine, &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; theoretically have lighter components and &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; possibly spool up slightly quicker than the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney  F119]]. I don't know the answer to this because much of the P&amp;W's performance is classified. Unlike a car, jet aircraft don't have positive traction in the normal sense. It's purely aerodynamic and it takes more time for the reaction to occur. I guess what I'm really talking about is [[Specific Impulse]]. Let's say the EJ200 can spool up from idle to max afterburner in 3 seconds and the F119 in 3.5. Let's assume there is no perceptible difference in AB light time. The advantage is with the Eurofighter.

::::::::Conversely, I would expect a lighter aircraft to slow more rapidly when power is reduced than a heavier one, even allowing for the increased size and drag of a larger airframe. What I'm proposing is that, in the merge I would expect to see the two aircraft approaching at say M=1.5 and decelerating to commence the engagement. Admittedly, the F-22 would likely be at its corner speed slightly sooner, given that I would expect it to be between 330 and 440kts, whereas the Eurofighter has to drop back to say 280-350kts. But it is axiomatic that combat slows as it goes. If the Eurofighter pilot can train his guns early on, he will maintain initiative.

::::::::If, on the other hand, the F-22 pilot can get a bead on the Eurofighter, if would be in the pilot's best interest to slow the combat down until he can either gain initiative or break off. This is where I would expect to see a smaller, lighter aircraft be able to accelerate away a little better. Whether it would be successful is anyone's guess but, as I said, I'm speculating and not proposing that anyone is right or wrong.

::::::::Unfortunately, F22 debates being what they are, it's not always easy to get a rational answer and equally, this sort of question I'm proposing probably falls outside the scope of a Wiki article.[[User:Flanker235|Flanker235]] ([[User talk:Flanker235|talk]]) 06:36, 24 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::It's all relative that's why static measurements under equal conditions are done. No matter the change of conditions the relative difference will be the same for the same conditions. The only dynamic difference is for example flow changes due to different aerodynamic flow over the body and or wind shadows from the body.

:::::::::The limits for intake airflow is the same for any aircraft. There may be differences in the pressure and temperature regime limits of an engine inlet, but they all work in the same &quot;main regime&quot;. Therefore, we can ignore the end limits. Since these are turbofans the flow at the turbines is more important than the fans. As the engines are similar they are roughly scaled version of each other which also means they will work relatively the same for the same air flow. The difference is the amount of air (=energy potential) stored. The bigger engine has exceeding more volume for any scale, hence, more power can be exerted. So the F119 should develop more power in the same time period for turning the turbine. Specific impulse is nothing more than an expression for energy density or flow potential if you so will. In this case the mixture of fuel and air. It doesn't say anything else. Thrust is its actual performance for an engine. Spooling time is as good as instantly since the [[General Electric J79]] with its revolutionary ability to turn the blades of its fan. At least that's what I'm understanding what the literature says. So it seems the spooling time is negligible now-a-day. 

:::::::::The F-22 has been optimized to maneuver at high mach speeds. I dunno about the Typhoon in this regard. On paper the F-22 is supreme. The literature says an aircraft slows down instantly as soon as thrust gets lower this is due to the enormous supersonic drag. I think that overrides the weight difference. According to the literature, the head-on-fight would be over already before both maneuver as both will open fire 3km away. It's also historically the most kill event with guns. Also it says early aiming is bad because the pilot will be forced to maneuver to correct the angle when it counts. In theory initiative=speed=energy, you have to keep yourself on the move no matter what =&gt; Speed is life. [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 02:48, 26 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::From a NASA TM X-73648 research paper on the F100 in 1977, it had a &quot;time to achieve commanded thrust change&quot; of 0.5s at Hi alt. and 2.0s at Lo alt. From sci.aeronautics.simulation/E-dYnE2nJrk someone (insider?) said &quot;The F100-PW-229 that is used in the F-15E has a starting RPM of 20 % N2.  From Idle to mil the response time is almost immediate, the same goes from mil to max.&quot; The idle N2 given seems low, though. [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 21:07, 26 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::Closer examining reveals that it's slower on low power setting. In the tested higher power range (propably mil power) the time ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 seconds. There are no data on the combat relevant settings. Idle is obviously at 20° PLA which explains the 20% citation above. Based on the 35 year old and early F100 engine data, and design differences the F119 has likely better reaction times. On a side note max N1 rpm is (a lot) less than half of max N2. That's all regarding combat engines for now. [[User:Mightyname|Mightyname]] ([[User talk:Mightyname|talk]]) 19:21, 27 December 2012 (UTC)

::::::::::&lt;code&gt;It's all relative that's why static measurements under equal conditions are done. No matter the change of conditions the relative difference will be the same for the same conditions. The only dynamic difference is for example flow changes due to different aerodynamic flow over the body and or wind shadows from the body.&lt;/code&gt;

::::::::::This is not true. It is true that the results are usually predictable but dynamic stability changes with airspeed, the centre of pressure shifting further aft as the aircraft accelerates. The changes in dynamic stability depend on design, particularly when canards are brought into the equation. In short, the dynamic stability of the F-22 will likely be more linear than that for the Eurofighter.

::::::::::As for the engine spool up speed, it's worth remembering the formula F=MxA. We're talking about &quot;work done&quot; here and a larger mass will need a larger amount of energy.

== Basic math inconsistency ==
The article says &quot;The F-22 was in production for 15 years, at a rate of roughly two per month&quot;, quoting the
referenced article [33] which says: &quot;“We’ve usually delivered two per month for the past 15 years,” said F-22 
Program Manager Jeff Babione.&quot; but 2/mo for 15yrs is 360 aircraft, and the true output was 195. This ought to 
rate at least some sort of acknowledgement in the text. Clearly Babione has inflated his estimate by 100%.

== F-22 vs Eurofighter Typhoon ==

Regarding the statement that slicked or stripped down Typhoons had a maneuverability advantage over the F-22, this was directly from the perspective of the Luftwaffe's EF Typhoon pilots. However the USAF's pilot accounts were never taken into context.  According to an interview conducted with the Raptor pilots, some of the accounts were quite interesting to say the least.

“I reviewed the HUD footage, a lot of gun shots from the F-22′s to the Eurofighters and not a whole lot coming back,” one Raptor pilot reported.

“the Typhoon has good energy and a pretty good first turn, but we were able to outmaneuver the Germans due to the Raptor’s thrust vectoring. Additionally, the Typhoon was not able to match the high angle of attack capability of the F-22. “We ended up with numerous gunshot kills,” another USAF pilot says.

== Unit Cost ==
Why is there still a unit cost of 150 millions in the box? It is an estimate from 2006 and doesn't seem to have any more relevance, since it since went up significantly. It seems the price is more like well over 300 millions (also mentioned in the section production and procurement). Since it is known, that the whole programm cost over 66 billion and 195 planes were built, its not so hard to come up with the actual unit cost. Can anybody enlighten me? [[User:Basilicum|Basilicum]] 21 June 2013
::The $150 million is correct. That is the production cost. The $300 million per is based on the project cost divided by the number aircraft built and delivered. That's not what it cost to actually build the plane, it's a common misconception. [[User:Dkspartan1|Dkspartan1]] ([[User talk:Dkspartan1|talk]]) 10:53, 29 June 2013 (UTC)

== Fighter Mafia and Eurofighter Red Flag engagement ==
The Eurofighter claims of downing Raptors is not a notable event. The consensus on the Eurofighter talk page was that it doesn't belong on that article either. Even if it was notable, the Eurofighter page is where it would go. The claims aren't NPOV, they don't include the US side of the story. We don't know what the exercise parameters were. The statement is nothing more than propaganda.

The Fighter Mafia bias of the F-22 and F-35 are well known. They try and claim the F-16 is just as good as the F-22. They are not reliable sources. If they are included then I'll just add a paragraph that debunks them if need be. [[User:Dkspartan1|Dkspartan1]] ([[User talk:Dkspartan1|talk]]) 10:48, 19 July 2013 (UTC)

== Removing this section ==
While it may be valid, I don't think this section belongs on this page, since it talks about perceived shortcomings of the F-22 by another company. Regardless of its validity, I believe it would be more suitable to place in the Sukhoi T-50 page, not here.

&quot;The F-22's design did introduce some limitations, however, as aircraft designers at Sukhoi noted when they designed the T-50. The F-22's engines are very close together, so thrust vectoring is not available to assist roll or yaw (see Aircraft principal axes), and there is no room for weapons bays on the same plane as the engines; they had to be placed around and below inlet ducts. The inlets' twisting design adds extra weight and recovery from stalls is complicated if thrust vectoring fails.[128]&quot;

I'm trying to do a bit of copy editing and trimming and make the tone of the article more professional and fix some of the grammar issues. Don't know why a lot of those edits got reverted. Also, is it really necessary to have the exact dates for everything? Consider this segment.

&quot;On 24 September 2008, Congress passed a defense spending bill funding continued production of the F-22.[68] On 12 November 2008, the Pentagon released $50 million of the $140 million approved by Congress to buy parts for an additional four aircraft, thus leaving the Raptor program in the hands of the incoming Obama Administration.[69] On 6 April 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates called for ending F-22 production in fiscal year 2011, leaving the USAF with a production run of 187 fighters, minus losses.[12] On 17 June 2009 the House Armed Services Committee inserted $368.8 million in the budget for a further 12 F-22s in FY 2011.[70]&quot;

I find all these specific dates rather unnecessary. I think just stating the year is good enough. Like this.

&quot;In 2008, Congress passed a defense spending bill funding the continued production of the F-22 and the Pentagon released $50 million of the $140 million approved by Congress to buy parts for an additional four aircraft, thus leaving the Raptor program in the hands of the incoming Obama Administration.[69] In April 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates under the Obama administration called for ending F-22 production in fiscal year 2011, thus leaving the USAF with a production run of 187 fighters.[12] However, in June 2009 the House Armed Services Committee inserted $368.8 million in the budget for a further 12 F-22s in FY 2011.[70]&quot;

Same message without the exact dates, because some of them are frankly just not important.

I'm also trying to reduce the usage of semicolons to make the sentences more fluid.

I'm also trying to fix errors. The first F-22 that flew in 1997 wasn't a production aircraft, it was an EMD jet, the first &quot;true&quot; prototype, if you will. The first production jet flew in the early 2000s. The YF-22s are strictly speaking not prototypes, but technology demonstrators.

&quot;The F-22's design has its engines positioned close together, so there is no room for weapons bays on the same plane as the engines; the bays were placed around and below inlet ducts. The inlets' twisting design adds extra weight and recovery from stalls is complicated if thrust vectoring fails.&quot;

Frankly, it just sounds out of place and doesn't belong here. This is what Sukhoi ''thinks'' is the F-22's limitations when designing the T-50. While it's relevant in the T-50 article, I don't think we need it here. I think it's much better to trim it to the following:

&quot;The F-22's engines are positioned close together, with internal weapons bays placed around and below the inlet ducts. Though heavy, the serpentine inlets ensure the engine face remains out of the line of sight of any exterior view.&quot;

Alternately, we can just remove this section completely.

== Modifying the lead ==
I propose that we cut or modify portions of this segment in the lead.

&quot;[The USAF] claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter. Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor's combination of stealth, speed, agility, precision and situational awareness, combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, makes it the best overall fighter in the world today. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in 2004 that the &quot;F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built.&quot;&quot;

I think it just sounds way too promotional, and a tad outdated now that more advanced Russian and Chinese fighters are appearing and will enter service in a few years. I think the following cut will sound more objective and professional.

&quot;The first fighter to combine stealth, speed, agility, precision and situational awareness, the Raptor offers greatly enhanced air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities compared to prior fighter aircraft.&quot;

== Is this overcite? ==

&quot;The F-22 has a threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint. The Raptor's stealth allows it to safely operate far closer to the battlefield, compensating for the reduced capability.[114] The F-22 is capable of functioning as a &quot;mini-AWACS&quot;, though the radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms such as the E-3 Sentry. The F-22 allows its pilot to designate targets for cooperating F-15s and F-16s, and determine whether two friendly aircraft are targeting the same aircraft. This radar system can sometimes identify targets &quot;many times quicker than the AWACS&quot;.[114] The radar is capable of high-bandwidth data transmission; conventional radio &quot;chatter&quot; can be reduced via these alternative means.[114]&quot;

The problem, as I see it, is that the sentence is a run-on. I'd first tackle this by breaking it into two sentences. The first sentence should be clarified in the manners that either RadicalDisconnect or Electric Wombat suggested. (I'll pick one at random.) I would also put the reasoning (the why) at the end of the sentence, because it is less important than &quot;the what.&quot; 

The latter sentence should begin with the sentence connector (respectively), because this serves the same purpose as a conjunction. The sentence should also be expanded and rearranged to show exactly what the percentages stand for. (Don't expect the reader to simply make the connection.) 

Thus, I would have it read something like this: ''&quot;The F-22 is constructed using materials such as high-strength [[titanium alloy]]s and composites, to withstand stress and heat.  Respectively, titanium accounts for 39% of the total weight while composites constitute 24%.&quot;'' But that's just my suggestion, based upon my interpretation of the context.

== Paragraph Break ==

The first two paragraphs of Design is currently as follows.

&quot;The F-22 Raptor is a fifth generation fighter that is considered fourth-generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, maneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single platform. The Raptor has large shoulder-mounted diamond wings, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading and trailing edge flaps, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these control surfaces also serve as the speed brake.

The aircraft's dual afterburning Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines are closely spaced and incorporate pitch axis thrust vectoring nozzles with a range of ±20 degrees; each engine has a maximum thrust in the 35,000 lbf (156 kN) class. The F-22's thrust to weight ratio in typical combat configuration is nearly at unity in maximum military power and 1.25 in full afterburner. Maximum speed without external stores is estimated to be Mach 1.82 during supercruise and greater than Mach 2 with afterburners.&quot;

However, I think it makes more sense to break it up this way.

:The decision on where to make a paragraph break should never be based upon a certain size. Instead, these breaks should be made when one point is finished and a new point begins. The first few sentence are like an introduction paragraph, so it is suitable to make the break just like you said. The next few sentences are about control surfaces, so they are well-suited to be their own paragraph. The last sentences are about the power plant, so that should be a paragraph of its own. Does that make sense? 

:Also, the sentence about the speed brake is not a clause but a complete sentence. There is a misplaced hyphen in 'fourth generation,&quot; and there are a few descriptions that are long and confusing, which could use hyphens and commas to improve the flow. The last sentence would be easier to understand if the word &quot;in&quot; a certain power-level was changed to &quot;at&quot; a certain power-level. In other words, I think it would read better like this:

::Noted. Although I don't think there should be a hyphen in &quot;stealth fighter&quot;. In addition, are the commas in &quot;large, shoulder-mounted, diamond wings&quot; are necessary? Also, why the hyphen for &quot;fifth generation&quot; but no hyphen for &quot;fourth generation&quot;?

:::The hyphens and commas are added when more than one adjective is used to describe a noun. A hyphen is used when one adjective is used to describe another adjective, but a comma is used when both adjectives are used to describe a noun. This helps to avoid snags caused by confusion over which is which. For example, in &quot;stealth-aircraft technology,&quot; the word &quot;technology&quot; is the noun, but the adjective &quot;stealth&quot; is being used to describe the other adjective, &quot;aircraft.&quot; Therefore, a hyphen is used to connect the adjectives. 

:::In &quot;fourth generation,&quot; the word &quot;generation&quot; is the noun and &quot;fourth&quot; is the adjective. Because only one adjective is being used, there is no confusion and, therefore, no snag. Thus, no need for a hyphen. However, in &quot;fifth-generation fighter,&quot; both &quot;fifth&quot; and &quot;generation&quot; are adjectives, describing the noun &quot;fighter,&quot; so it is better to use a hyphen to show that the adjective &quot;fifth&quot; is being used to describe the other adjective and not the noun. (More importantly, it shows that the word &quot;generation&quot; is not a noun.)

:::Another snag is found in the phrase &quot;large shoulder mounted diamond wings.&quot; With so many adjectives in a row it is difficult to tell which is describing what. By adding some commas and hyphens, it becomes clear what the adjectives are describing, and therefore eliminates the snag for the reader, improving flow. The long description of the engines are also in need of hyphens and commas, because that is a big snag. [[User:Zaereth|Zaereth]] ([[User talk:Zaereth|talk]]) 09:48, 29 December 2014 (UTC)

:::I might also add that anytime there is a noun ending in &quot;-ing,&quot; being used as an adjective to modify another noun, it should usually be hyphenated with the noun to avoid noun/verb confusion.

== Rephrasing this section ==

&quot;The USAF had originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a cost of $26.2 billion, with production beginning in 1994. The 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced the number to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996. In 1994, it was cut to 438 aircraft entering service by 2004; in 1997, the number was further cut to 339.&quot;

I think the part that describes the gradual reduction in procurement numbers is overly detailed, especially the part above. After reading the source, how about we change it to the following:

The 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced the number to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996. By 1997, funding instability further cut the number to 339.&quot;

== Reassess article under GA criteria? ==

This article has seen quite a bit of change since it was promoted to GA status back in 2011. Should we reassess it now? [[Special:Contributions/108.228.145.163|108.228.145.163]] ([[User talk:108.228.145.163|talk]]) 06:25, 29 December 2014 (UTC)

== Difference between ranges? ==

FTA:
 Range: &gt;1,600 nmi (1,840 mi, 2,960 km) with 2 external fuel tanks
 ...
 Ferry range: 2,000 mi (1,740 nmi, 3,220 km)
Since the ferry range also includes external fuel tanks, and the range doesn't include cargo because that would be the combat radius, what is the difference between the range and the ferry range in this case?  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.139.86.190|82.139.86.190]] ([[User talk:82.139.86.190|talk]]) 13:27, 10 January 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Range, Combat radius, and ferry range are linked in the specs table.  Either you not try clicking on those links or those pages were not clear enough.  Ferry range is without payload (other than fuel), while range is ''with'' payload.  Combat radius is the radius of a circular area of operation with a certain amount of time on station (combat radius is less than half of the range). -[[User:Fnlayson|Fnlayson]] ([[User talk:Fnlayson|talk]]) 15:29, 10 January 2015 (UTC)
I did click all the links, but it wasn't clear. The range doesn't specify what kind of range it is, most of relevant external links don't load, and those that do don't contain the figure, nor an explanation of what the figure means. The figure itself is also uncited.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/145.15.244.30|145.15.244.30]] ([[User talk:145.15.244.30|talk]]) 07:34, 14 January 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Remove this bit ==

Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]], former Chief of the [[Australian Defence Force]], said in 2004 that the &quot;F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built.&quot;

I don't think this belongs in the lead. That is a subjective statement made more than 10 years ago, and it doesn't reflect new developments like the Sukhoi T-50, Chengdu J-20, or the USN's upcoming F/A-XX or the USAF's planned F-X.

:Second this removal. It's an old statement, and made in the context of the early 2000s assumption that manned fighters will disappear, a trend that doesn't reflect current DOD projections anymore.

I'm unclear from the article if 3.2A is now an operational capability or still under testing. Do we have a better ref for this? [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 18:10, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
