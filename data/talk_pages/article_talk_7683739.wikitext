== The red looks angry ==

The red color you have now is rather angry looking - I'm assuming it's reflecting your stress level?  Sorry.  :(  Can I change it to a nice, soothing, Esperanzial green?  ;)  Also, I've managed to get the first post after you archived again - yay! -- [[User:Natalya|Nataly]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Natalya/Esperanza|a]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

''I'm feeling better now'' - wow!  That's exciting, and rather positive!  Wheeeee! :D  Next time you're stressed out, I'm going to remind you that at one point you actually said that things were better. ;)  -- [[User:Natalya|Nataly]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Natalya/Esperanza|a]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:18, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

==re:Please stay==
I appriciate your concern Highway, but.. damn, I'm getting sick of the people on Wikipedia (not you :p) I got other things to do rather than waste my time trying to prove to people that I have good intentions. It's just too much for me to handle right now, all I',m doing right now is trying to fix-up the SummerSlam articles and then I'm outta here. Honestly, I'm tired of assuming good faith with an Encyclopedia that doesn't give it back. — &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Moe Epsilon|&lt;font color=&quot;CD2626&quot;&gt;The King of Kings&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:06 July 19 '06

:::Well, I've had a stalker since December because I edited his user page ''one'' time and he through a fit and decided to ruin any chance at adminship I ever had. The NCV stalks me, I some lunatic in Australia stalking me over the Internet and taking my nickname &quot;King of Kings&quot; and using as his own on his own personal website, which is just retarded in retrospect. I also have another person from the [[YTMND]] wiki spamming me which is getting annoying.

So, I guess after I finish up the articles I'm working on, I'll move on with life.

The line in question is &quot;Dropping the health to half or below activates a hold item called a Salac [[List of Pokémon items#Berry|Berry]], which increases the speed of the holder, when the HP falls below one half.&quot; It's already mentioned that it activates when HP is below half, it doesn't need to be stated twice.[[User:MasterSlowPoke|Craig Sniffen]] 05:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

== Comment ==

You are also breaking the terms of conditions by favouring a person's summary over the another. You yourself said earlier through your mouth that no one owns the article and is free to change the content if one feels there are inaccuracies. [[User:Digisouth14|Digisouth14]] 00:13, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

I have the right to report you too. Why so? You could have just edited my summary and not revert it. It shows your personal slant towards your choice of articles which is the same as your accusation of my using personal prose, your slant of which has not one thing to do with fact. Btw, Homophobia getting in the way of writing down facts is also a personal thing.[[User:Digisouth14|Digisouth14]] 00:30, 23 July 2006 (UTC)


No power to edit summaries?  So how come the fellow before me had the right to have his/her summary wrtten, stayed,  not totally edited? As a plus, other folks have  the right to edit pior's summary and their editions stay, can you honestly tell me they are one of the &quot;6&quot; mentioned? Some sort of privilage thing going on? Who has the right to objectly say yes or no? [[User:Digisouth14|Digisouth14]] 01:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)


To HighwayCello, Please do not engage in personal attacks, subtle threats or try to start an edit war. Refer to [[WP:NPA]].

That edit is not good. &quot;That is what nijongo (sic) means&quot; doesn't cut it - First off people reading the article can't see the &quot;nihongo&quot; - Second, though, convention for fictional characters is that, if the name actually differs in Japan, you say XX, known in the Japanese version as YY(Nihongo that), - That's what is done for all fictional characters on Wikipedia.

== Goody! ==

That's so nice to see that your stress level is down - yay! :D  It makes me smile (and I'm sure it makes you smile a lot more!).  Nice with the wireless keyboard, too, that's pretty awesome. -- [[User:Natalya|Nataly]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Natalya/Esperanza|a]]&lt;/font&gt; 00:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
:Ah, you would be surprised to know that I did actually know that you had something on the &quot;Did You Know&quot;. 

:Wow... that was a crazy sentence.  Congratulations on it! :D  -- [[User:Natalya|Nataly]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Natalya/Esperanza|a]]&lt;/font&gt; 00:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::Oh my goodness, Dr. Seuss!  I just read through his [[Dr._Seuss#List_of_books|bibliography]], and I forgot how awesome his books were - even not as a little kid!  Too bad I don't have any anywhere, or I would totally read them, despite the fact that I would probably look more than a little silly. :) -- [[User:Natalya|Nataly]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Natalya/Esperanza|a]]&lt;/font&gt; 11:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== my RfA ==

&lt;div style=&quot;align: center; padding: 1em; border: solid 2px darkblue; background-color: lightcyan;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Smiley.svg|left|60px| ]] Thanks for your support in my RfA! Unfortunately, the request did not pass, with a vote of (43/16/7). But your support was appreciated and I'll just keep right on doing what I do. Maybe I'll see ya around -- I'll be here!&lt;br&gt;Cheers! - [[User:CheNuevara|CheNuevara]] 17:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;

== &quot;rollback beats me to vandalism&quot; ==

Just curious, but why does this bother you? I'd think the effect is the same (the page is cleaned up), so where does the difficulty come in? If your edit is more than a simple rollback (i.e. you're tagging other things for citation, or expanding/rewording the article), then you can still go ahead and add your edits on top of the rollback..right? Or am I missing something? -- ''[[User:Nae'blis|nae]]'[[User_talk:Nae'blis|blis]]'' 18:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== Your RfA ==

Hi HighwayCello,

Good to see you've decided to re-apply for adminship. I was neutral last time, but I'm likely a support this time. One detail though: I'd like to see a link to your last RfA from this one. I believe its pertinent information and it would be much better if you are open about the first RfA. Some editors may believe that you are trying to hide the past. I'd hate to see your second RfA run into opposition because of that. Good luck, [[User:Gwernol|Gwernol]] 22:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
