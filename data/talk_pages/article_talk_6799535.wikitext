[[Image:Stop hand.svg|left|30px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. We invite everyone to contribute constructively to our encyclopedia. Take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing. However, unconstructive edits, such as those you made to [[:Slavery]], are considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]. If you continue in this manner you may be '''blocked from editing without further warning'''. Please stop, and consider improving rather than damaging the hard work of others. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:blatantvandal-n --&gt; A link to the edit I have reverted can be found here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74059414 link].

Please stop. If you continue to vandalize pages, as you did to [[:Slavery]], you will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. &lt;!-- Template:Test3-n (Third level warning) --&gt;  If you feel that the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slavery&amp;diff=74147388&amp;oldid=74147296 edit I reverted] should not have been reverted, please contact me. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User_talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 15:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
