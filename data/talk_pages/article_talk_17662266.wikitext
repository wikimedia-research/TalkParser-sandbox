==[[List of fictional supercouples]]==
When putting in couples without urls to validate their listings, do you think you can list what page it is on? If not, because you don't have the page number, for whatever reason, or because it was rather an online citation whose url has gone dead, that's fine.

But remember to place any couple you add in order on the list. [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]] ([[User talk:Flyer22|talk]]) 00:29, 29 May 2008 (UTC)
