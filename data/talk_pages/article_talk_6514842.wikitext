== Speedy deletion of [[Template:Infobox LE Organization]] ==
A tag has been placed on [[Template:Infobox LE Organization]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#T3|section T3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is a deprecated or orphaned template. After seven days, if it is still unused and the speedy deletion tag has not been removed, the template will be deleted.

If the template is intended to be substituted, please feel free to remove the speedy deletion tag and please consider putting a note on the template's page indicating that it is substituted so as to avoid any future mistakes (&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;#123;{transclusionless}}&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).

Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:RL0919|RL0919]] ([[User talk:RL0919|talk]]) 20:50, 16 October 2009 (UTC)
