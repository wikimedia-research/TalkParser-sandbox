[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]

The article [[Pauvre couture]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''[[WP:V|Unverified]] and a cursory Google search indicates this is not a [[WP:NEO|notable neologism]].'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Pauvre couture|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist.  The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; ''[[User:Pink Bull|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color: #FF1493&quot;&gt;Pink&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Pink Bull|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color: #FF1493&quot;&gt;Bull&lt;/span&gt;]]'' 01:52, 13 December 2010 (UTC)
