==Naval or National?==
*There's an obvious problem here, the picture in the infobox clearly says &quot;'''Naval''' Aviation Museum&quot; not &quot;'''National''' Aviation Museum,&quot; so which is it? Is the article under the wrong title, or do we have a picture of the wrong place? [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 16:48, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

==It is Naval==
*sorry about that. I didn't know how to go back and edit the main title of the page. But for sure, it should be Naval and the picture is correct. Please change the main title to &quot;Naval Aviation Museum&quot;, Thanks --[[User:Theoffice89|Theoffice89]] ([[User talk:Theoffice89|talk]]) 22:19, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:{{fixed}} Although I had to disambiguate it from [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] so I tacked (India) on the title.--[[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 22:28, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
