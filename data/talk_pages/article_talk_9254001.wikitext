== One People ==

The article you created at [[One People]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]], but it may be a good start for your own userpage. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where you are encouraged to write about yourself. You are free to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

The purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so you should not consider your user page to be a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing may be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information.&lt;!-- Template:Userfied --&gt;  - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 07:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Åsmund Gylder]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Åsmund Gylder]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a band or musician, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (music)|notability guideline for musical topics]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Åsmund Gylder|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Åsmund Gylder|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you.&lt;!-- Template:Db-band-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Noq|noq]] ([[User talk:Noq|talk]]) 11:27, 20 September 2009 (UTC)

==Unreferenced BLPs==
[[File:Information.svg|30px]] Hello Gylder! Thank you for your contributions. I am a [[WP:BOT|bot]] alerting you that '''1''' of the articles that you created   is tagged as an[[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Sources| Unreferenced Biography of a Living Person]]. The [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] policy requires that all personal or potentially controversial information be sourced. In addition, to ensure [[WP:VERRIFY|verifiability]], all biographies should be based on [[WP:RELIABLE|reliable sources]]. If you were to bring this article up to standards, it would greatly help us with the current ''[[:Category:All_unreferenced_BLPs|{{PAGESINCATEGORY:All_unreferenced_BLPs}}]]'' article backlog. Once the article is adequately referenced, please remove the {{tl|unreferencedBLP}} tag. Here is the article:

# [[Åsmund Gylder]] - &lt;small&gt;{{findsources|Åsmund Gylder}}&lt;/small&gt;
