&quot;Soviet and American attempts to cover the massacre&quot;  
Do you mean &quot;cover&quot; (to report about) or do you mean &quot;cover up&quot; (to hide)? --anon, 1 Jul 2004

:: cover up, which has since been corrected [[User:Krupo|Krupo]] 04:28, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)

It is not clear as to why Roosevelt would want to cover up the Soviet massacres. At first glance at the heading I thought the Communists and the American President had something in common. It's clear why one murderous leadership would want to put massacres they committed themselves into the shoes of a competing murderous regime. But, Roosevelt??? [[User:Whyerd|Whyerd]] 17:38, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:It indeed needs explanation. The problem was that there were approx 7 to 10 millions of ethnic Poles in the US at the time, large majority of them voted for him in the presidential elections. Roosevelt did not want to enrage his electorate. For similar reasons the agreements from Yalta were not publicised until after the war. 

:Other cause was that he was considering the case of Polish government in exile a problem of United Kingdom. He apparently believed that taking part in the Polish-Soviet dispute would only enrage uncle Jojo, while the US of A would win nothing if FDR decided to back Poland.

The following was posted by [[User:Rogper]] in [[Katyn]] article. I believe it should be incorporated into this articla rather than geography-related Katyn. How to do this? [[User:Halibutt|[[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User Talk:Halibutt|tt]]]] 22:15, Oct 27, 2004 (UTC)

::''The Soviet regime attempted to cover the event, but some, mostly Polish descentances, started to investigate the thing further. This was the case with [[Roman Marini]] from [[Krak√≥w]], together with his two students, who in 1946 personally investigated the graves. Marini was later executed and the two other students disappeared after a positive attempt to flew from prison; their destiny is, however, unknown. In 1971, the danish descent musician [[Elisabeth Tramsen]] disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and the case has in fact not yet today found satisfaction or resolution. In the contemporary, her father [[Helge Tramsen]] started a movement to raise the opinion in Scandinavia, but his work gained not enough attention. In 1989,  [[Stefan Niedzialak]], the founder of Katyn foundation, was beaten to death.''

Yes, maybe you have right; it suits perhaps better here. // [[User:Rogper|Rogper]] 12:04, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

&quot;On Christmas Eve of 1939, all priests of every confession, including Catholics, Orthodox, Jews, Protestants and Greek Catholics were removed from the camps and probably murdered separately.&quot;

:''Probably''? This needs substantiation. [[User:119|119]] 01:58, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==The Jan Masaryk connection==

Some of the following could be incorporated in the main article if it can be checked (which came from a book read long ago):

The Germans took a number of experts from the countries they occupied to investigage the Katyn site. The Czech expert was later to do the post mortuum on [[Jan Masaryk]].

== Irving ==

What is the purpose of including the link to neo-Nazi writer Irving's book? He was controversial from the start, including his Sikorski-murder thesis. I'd suggest reading Prof. Richard Evans' report, in which some of Irving's early distortions are discussed. This man should not be counted upon the present an objective historical narrative. Also, what is the source of &quot;On Christmas Eve of 1939, all clergy, including Roman and Greek Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, and Protestant, were removed from the camps and probably murdered separately.&quot;? This should be deleted if no source is forthcoming.

: Dear anon. Irving is controversial, yes. But I read his book about Sikorski and it contains some interesting facts about Sikorski's death and Katyn, and I used it for source of some information in both articles, thus I believe his books should remain in the references/external link section. If you can prove to me that some parts of the article(s) are wrong/disputed, I will happilly correct them. The fact that the author later became a '''controversial''' Neo-Nazi (there are several archive talk pages about that on his page...) does not automatically makes everything he wrote usless. --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 20:12, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
: I don't know about this sentence, I didn't add it and I have no sources for or against it. However, according to Wiki policy, the sentences should not be deleted unless you have a source that proves it wrong (or it is obviously an error). Could you point out to me the Irving distortions regarding Katyn/Sikorski issue? --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 20:14, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::As I said, Irving was controversial from the beginning. Evans points out the distortions in his Dresden book. Thus it is not the matter of me pointing out the mistakes, but rather people relying on a priori shaky source. It may happen that most of what Irving says in his book about post-Katyn repercussions is true, but until proven innocent, he must be presumed guilty. I will no longer delete the links, but I will contemplate putting some sort of short notice, saying that the writer is controversial.

::Now about the priests. In &quot;Katyn. Plenniki neobjavlennoj vojny. Dokumenty i materialy&quot; (ed. Pikhoja, Gejsztor (sp?)), Moscow, 1999, we find several facts contradicting this sentence.

::Document no. 179 (pp. 317ff) - the &quot;Numerical data on POWs in Starobielsk camp for February 1, 1940&quot; lists 16 priests.

::So it is not true that all clergy was separated in 1939.

::On p. 431 there is a note on chaplain Stanislaw Kontek (Kantek (sp?)), who on 24 Feb. 1940 was sent to Moscow from Ostashkov, then, in 1941(!), to Griazovets, where he was with other surviving priests - (sp?) Bednarczik, Dubrowka, Judycki, Kulikowski and Wzdenczny. Then he was in Totsk, Iran and Beirut.

::So, again, it cannot be even stated that the priests were &quot;killed separately&quot;.

::(The Polish source is given: 	Ks. Kamil Kantak, Od Griazowca do Pahlewi (Fragment z pamietnika//&quot;Marianum w Slurbie&quot;, nr. 5-6/71-72, Londyn Wrzesien-Grudzien, 1967, s. 82-84).

::(It is thus also not true that only 395 people from Jukhnov survived.)

::On p. 521 it is stated that among those sent to execution to Smolensk and Kharkov there were 18 chaplains and other clergymen.

::According to the tables in appendices in all three camps there were military clergymen up to the execution.

::As an interesting side note, search for Stanislaw Kontek gave a result in the Katyn memorial list (http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_K.html). Unless it is a coincidence (and I've seen such with Katyn lists), the list on that page must be based on reconstructed data rather than on the Soviet lists. The reconstructed lists are known to have such glitches.--[[User:Polyphem|Polyphem]] 01:44, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Thank you for the interestign sources, you may want to add them to the refence section. While I would approach any Soviet/Russian sources with extreme caution, I don't have any contrary references for this. I added word 'controversial' to the Sikorski's book elink. As far as I can tell, this book has little or no neo-Nazis sympathies and most if its facts are not that controversial; it was from the next decade that Irving works became controversial. --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 10:46, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

=== Irving's &quot;mistakes&quot; ===

Meanwhile, here are several indications that Irving is not to be trusted re: Katyn.

http://www.fpp.co.uk/Auschwitz/docs/controversies/barbers_story_2005.html

&quot;Given that the former Soviet archives reveal that the principal NKVD officers who signed the death warrants and carried out the Katyn massacre were Jewish&quot; - it's a bald-faced lie.

: Is it? I don't have sources pro or against. Of course if Irving gives no sources, this is just an accusation and should not be put in our text - but unless you have sources giving another nationality, this cannot be called a lie (it is true that *some* NKVD officers were Jewish, after all, although I wouldn't give much credit to any Irving conspiracy's theoris regarding Jews). One way or another, those sentences are not included in our Wiki article and won't be unless sb can give proof they are correct, so I think this is a rather moot point in this discussion.  --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 10:57, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Some people in Katyn affair were Jewish. Only one from NKVD comes to mind now, though, L. Raikhman, who did not have any direct involement, but was preparing the Katyn case for Nuremberg. Most executioners were Slavic, and their names can be found in literature, e.g. in the book I mentioned and in &quot;Katyn 1940-2000. Rasstrel. Sud'by zhivykh. Ekho Katyni.&quot;, Moscow, 2001. The troika specified in the shooting order, consisted of Merkulov (Russian), Kobulov (Armenian) and Bashtakov (Russian). (Nationalities are given accoring to &quot;Kto rukovodil NKVD&quot;, http://www.memo.ru/history/NKVD/kto/biogr/index.htm).--[[User:Polyphem|Polyphem]] 11:36, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:&quot;If he had been captured by the Russians, he would have ended up with the 15,000 other Poles in the mass graves at Katyn.&quot; - there weren't 15,000 in Katyn.
: Well, it depends if we mean Kozielsk (which was 4,500 according to our text) or other camps (over 20k total).

::It doesn't depend on that. The language is clear &quot;mass graves at Katyn&quot;. (Besides, there were 15,000 from all camps, not over 20k total).

: And I am not sure if during the 60s when Irving wrote the book the exact figures where known,

::The exact figure of bodies exhumed at Katyn by the Germans was known from 1943.


: remember that it was only after 1990 that Russian admitted their crime

::Not after, but in 1990.

: and allowed investigations of site/archives. --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 10:57, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/General/Katyn/KatynHanged.html - all wrong, the only one sentences on Katyn charges was Duere/Diere, who in 1950s wrote that he was coerced. He wasn't hanged.
: It looks like this is an article written by a Canadian professor, not Irving.

:: So what? He has it on his site as a source. That he accepts it as a fact is evident from http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/month/0199.html

: And as I have no sources for pros or against it, I can hardly say how relevant it is to our discussion. --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 10:57, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Too bad. I think the book &quot;Katyn. Zbrodnia chroniona tajemnica panstwowa&quot; may contain this information. I took my info from Jazhborovskaja, Jablokov, Parsadanova, &quot;Katynskij sindrom v sovetsko-pol'skikh i rossijsko-pol'skikh otnoshenijakh&quot; (J.S. Ja&amp;#380;borowskaja, A.Ju. Jab&amp;#322;okow, W.S. Parsadanowa, Syndrom katy&amp;#324;ski w stosunkach polsko-radzieckich i polsko-rosyjskich).

http://www.focal.org/overflow/Goebbels.pdf - in the chapter on Katyn Irving distorts the number of victims in the forest. &quot;By April 13 twelve thousand rotting corpses had been exhumed.&quot; If he can't get the very basics correct, who knows what errors he made in more advanced stuff? &quot;Apr 16, 1943; the former NKVD officer Petr Soprunenko, who signed the Katyn death warrant, lives in Moscow as an old age pensioner (1994).&quot; - according to the Katyn literature and &quot;Kto rukovodil NKVD&quot;, Soprunenko died in 1992. So again the basic, verifiable fact is wrong.
And he should have known that Soprunenko didn't sign the order.

--[[User:Polyphem|Polyphem]] 22:54, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I wrote about numbers above,

:: Me too. And I can add that Goebbels is a relatively recent book.

: and as for Soprunenko, well, it is a mistake, but a rather small one. Still, I didn't read this book, I only read Sikorski's one.--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 10:57, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: And a final note: of course Irving cannot be trusted. One can discuss how much truth there is in his books, but it is proved that at least parts of what he wrotes are mistakes/lies. I could myself add more examples of errors in his '''books'''. So we agree on this. However, this is OT - we should be concerned with factual info in the [[Katyn Massacre]] article here, not Irving mistakes, which are not relevant to this article. I took from his book some dates, Berlin Radio quote, Goebbels quote, Ivan Maisky quote, Churchill quotes, which I used to add info to sections 'Discovery' and 'Attempts to cover up the massacre' (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Katyn_Massacre&amp;diff=11002040&amp;oldid=9859506 this] for my changes, note that there were some minor changes by other users during this period). If you can show me that any of those statements are false, I'd be the first to delete them ASAP. However, we cannot say that since they are based on Irving book they are automatically false and all what he wrote is total fiction. Innocent until proven guilty is still a rule of thumb here. --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 11:08, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)


:: Hey, how about &quot;I don't trust the Soviet sources&quot; above? :-) Once discredited, the author can't be trusted. I have shown that he makes blatant mistakes in basic facts, sometimes driven by his ideology (as with the &quot;Jewish NKVD&quot; example). Such a source should be verified _before_ using it. --[[User:Polyphem|Polyphem]] 11:36, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I don't trust them, because see Recent Developments section - Russians (at least some of them) are still not willing to admit they did anything wrong. That aside, I don't demand all Soviet sources to be verified. As for Irving, as I wrote, if you think any part of my changes is wrong (or even controversial), please point that out. Otherwise, I see no reason why we should dispute the source. Irving wrote, for example, that the Second World War ended in 1945. Was this a lie as well? :&gt; --[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] [[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]] 23:39, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Death toll ==
=== Savenkov's death toll ===

According to http://old.lenta.ru/news/2005/03/22/poland/ he gave only the death toll for the camps, slightly more high than that in Shelepin's letter. Together with the prisons this gives us about 22,000 victims.

:: According to link you gave Savenkov's death toll is 1803. And 22 (twenty two) of them are identified. : [[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 13:31, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
Some Soviet documents present a higher estimate for the camps - 15,131. E.g. this number can be found in 5.12.43 report of major Denisov. Although it is explicitly stated that all the people were from the three camps, it is not completely clear. It is possible that some Poles from other camps or prisons were killed together with the Poles from the three camps.--[[User:Polyphem|Polyphem]] 19:58, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::One of the problems is the so-called Ukrainian list, or a list of people who were surely murdered in April and May of 1940, but barely anyone knows (that is except for the Russian historians and Military Prosecutors' Office) where were they buried or killed. The name comes from the fact that the majority of those listed there were last seen in various prisons across the Ukraine. [[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User talk:Halibutt|tt]] 10:54, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

=== The number of executed ===

==== Poor wording ====

I think the wording of the possible death toll in the first paragraph: &quot;from 1,803 to 14,540 through 21,857 to 28,000.&quot; is very unclear and convoluted.  It should either be simplified to a lowest-highest reported range, or if the contributor prefers to distinguish between sources, give one range and note *one* source, then another range and note *that* source.  But the way it is now, if I understand it correctly, is reporting a &quot;range of ranges&quot;  Not clear enough for my standards of usability.[[User:Drewson99|Drewson99]] 03:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)


In Russian WIki its 11,000??

in German 14.552 Kriegsgefangene ermordet: Die gr√∂√üten Gruppen davon mit 4.421 in Kozielsk, 6.311 in Ostashkov und 3.982 in Starobielsk

:Please sign your comments. I had a chance to remark before - [[Battle of Polonka]] I think it was - that Polish historians tend to inflate the figures of casualties by doubling or trebling the actual figure. So I wouldn't be surprized if that is the case here. I would also list Yury Mikhin's monograph ''Anti-Russian Slur'' among the sources. We should leave Halibutt worship his Polish booklets alone, or perhaps in company with Lysy and Piotrus. Links to prop webistes - www.cia.gov, www.fca.gov.uk - should be purged. Instead, there is an independant website - www.katyn.ru - proving that the whole affair was forged by CIA propaganda. I have no time for it now, but will probably return to the topic after reviewing the conduct of our Polish friends on [[History of Belarus]]. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirlandajo]] 16:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

::To answer your question, it depends on whether we count only the names on the NKVD list (14.552) or the so-called Ukrainian list as well. The latter lists also Polish officers last seen in various NKVD prisons and camps in the Ukraine who were murdered in smaller actions across the USSR. The latter includes some 8000 names, hence the higher figure. And why the Russian wiki mentions only 11,000 escapes me, especially that the NKVD order itself mentioned 26,700 people...

===14,000 vs 22,000 ===
I have to take a break from verification now. Can somebody provide a source for the 22,000 number? All sources I have found so far (note I wasn't looking for those numbers on purpose) give about 14-15,000 (Zawodny, Mosnews). PWN on Katy≈Ñ gives 'kilkana≈õcie tysiƒôcy' (untranslatable polish measurment for between 11,000 and 19,000). Our article currently uses the 22,000: '':about 6000 POWs from the Ostashkov camp, about 4,000 POWs from the Starobielsk camp, about 4500 POWs from the Kozielsk camp, and about 7000 prisoners in Western parts of Belarus and Ukraine.&quot;'' Now Zawodny gives the same numbers for camps (actually, somewhat more specific - see my recent additions), and that totals around 15,000. But what source gives that '7000 prisoners in Western parts of Belarus and Ukraine'?--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:55, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

::Again, it's a problem of whether we include the ''Ukrainian list'' still missing or not. The problem is that there were also a lot of Poles imprisoned in minor camps and prisons in &quot;Western Belarus&quot; and &quot;Western Ukraine&quot;. A large number of officers were last seen there and are still missing and presumably killed in the same massacre. The &quot;Ukrainian trace&quot; is mentioned also in several Russian documents, though still little is known. For instance there is a Beria's order of March 22 to transfer ca. 3000 Polish prisoners from prisons in Lw√≥w, R√≥wne, Tarnopol, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and Drohobycz to prisons in Kiev, Kharkov and Kherson, while additional 3000 were to be transferred from Brze≈õƒá, Wilejka, Pi≈Ñsk and Baranowicze to Minsk. It is often assumed that these could have been murdered in [[Kuropaty]] near Minsk and [[Bykovnia]] near Kiev. There is archaeological evidence that some Poles were indeed murdered there, but after 60 years little is certain. The Russians have provided the list of names of those transfered to Ukrainian prisons to the Polish historians, but all other documents are lacking, including the analogical list of people sent to Minsk. You can read more on that [http://www.wspolnota-polska.org.pl/index.php?id=ak50322_1 here], in an article by one of IPN historians - sadly in Polish only.

::As to the source for both numbers - it is the infamous Politburo P13/144 document ([http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_resolution.html] for instance), where the case of &quot;14,700 POWS held in the camps - former Polish Army officers, government officials, landowners, policemen, intelligence agents, military policemen, settlers and jailers&quot; is treated together with the case of &quot;arrested and remaining in prisons in the western districts of Ukraine and Byelorussia people in the number of 11 000 - members of various counter-revolutionary spy and sabotage organizations, former landowners, factory owners, former Polish Army officers, government officials and fugitives&quot;. Later the group bound for extermination was limited to 18,632 people, and we do not know for sure how many people were in fact murdered following the order of March 5th. Hence the difference in numbers given. [[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User talk:Halibutt|tt]] 01:41, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Maybe the best solution would be to put these additional numbers in a general article, possibly titled [[Repression of Poles in the Soviet Union during World War II]].  I have a feeling that we are trying to cram too much into this article, which should really refer to only those deaths which were verified.  After all, the number of Poles who disappeared without a trace in the Soviet Union must run into at least tens of thousands, counting all those who died in the labour camps of the Gulag or from harsh conditions during deportation and exile.

I fail to see why David Irving elicits such suspicion in here, if one had dared to suggest the Germans had been wrongfully accused of the Katyn forest massacre pre-1990 they would be labeled a &quot;historical revisionist&quot; in North America, most likely imprisoned in Europe and probably far worse in the Soviet Union. Makes you wonder just how many more dirty little secrets the Nazis took the blame for during the war. Expecially interesting consider Vladimeir Putin's statement about &quot;clearing up certain historical problems&quot; in reference to certain alleged mass graves in eastern Europe that has been one of the corner stones of the holocaust claims against Germany. The whole &quot;100,000 bodies still on fire to this day burried in the pits&quot; story. It almost sounds as silly as &quot;the Germans are making soap and beauty products out of jewish body fat and lampshades from the skin of murdered jews.&quot; According to the &quot;Nazi hunter&quot; Simon Weisenthal.

You see there are  evidences that it was made by Nazi.
Question: Is this massacre not simply standard Stalinist procedure? Stalin committed so many violent purges of his own people that, when Hitler's armies suddenly attacked Stalin in 1941, there were scarcely any Russian generals left to resist him. If the Nazi's had not been as bad as Stalin and would not have murdered &quot;inferior&quot; Slavic peasants and Jewish peoples during their attack, the captive peoples of Russia might have risen up against the Soviets and successfully overthrown Stalin instead.  Why are you pro-Soviet apologists quibbling over the number of victims in the Katyn Forest Massacre? Stalin was a murdering, paranoid fanatic and a sociopath. It's a wonder there is anyone left in Russia alive. He didn't just have twenty thousand people from Poland executed. Stalin murdered millions of people! He had over five million people starved to death in the Ukraine alone! When did the Soviet army ever overrun any territory and there was not a massacre of innocent civilians afterward? Did any country or people ever say to the Soviets, &quot;Hey. We don't know how to run our country. Please come in and show us how to do it&quot;? Exactly. The very purpose of Soviet plans for world domination is to liquidate the intelligentsia (those who know how to run things, like the victims murdered and dumped at Katyn) after conquering the territory, in order to eliminate the very idea of any other system other than communism. -Ned. (Sept.)
Maybe the Soviets should set up a program about world hunger: &quot;How to have all your crops fail for seventy-five years in a row.&quot; 
My above point is this: the Katyn Forest Massacre didn't happen within a historic vacuum. After the Bolshevik Revolution, which was violent, the Soviets first massacred the people around Moscow who were related in any way to Czarist Russia. Then the Soviets massacred the people in the nearer provinces whom they thought might resist. Then the Soviets eliminated the people in the outer provinces who didn't like what they were doing. It was systematic. It took the Soviets decades to consolidate their power in Russia (while the West stood by). It is standard procedure for Communists to eliminate the enemies of their revolution. Within this context of historical methodology (no matter how violent or murderous it is), the Katyn Massacre should not really surprise anybody. It is what the Communists always do.-Ned. (Sept.)
:You probably meant to say: &quot;that's what dictatorships always do&quot;. The size of killing in Suviet Union is simply because the country was big and the killing tools were modern and eficient.  [[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 20:01, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

-- Quite frankly, I think most central/eastern europeans would closely sympathize with the poles on this loss although it is relatively small, if one may say that! The soviets, especially through Stalin, did murder millions of people indeed, of their own too. They also displaced large populations and re-colonized annexed territories to the point of identity loss for some smaller countries. The tragedy and scale of all that is hard to grasp from the relative comfort of the west. The interesting point though is how, according to the reporting from this year's May 9th celebrations for instance, Stalin is still favorably viewed by many russians and even their official position on the matter seemed somewhat ambiguous. R(sept.05)

I don't believe POV ranting has any place here. If you're not talking about how to improve this article then it doesn't belong. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 02:44, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

This is a discussion page, isn't it? My comments are providing background information on Stalinist methodology: Stalin always did the same thing, for as long as he remained in power. He murdered masses of people everywhere, in everyplace that he was in control, to further Marxist-Leninist goals, and to gain power. Is this not true? Does this not have a historical bearing upon the Katyn Forest Massacre? Is it not relevant to the discussion?-Ned (Sept.)

:As far as I know, the view that the Nazis perpetrated the massacre is not espoused by any major historians, governments, or organizations that have investigated the matter.  The Russians themselves have admitted guilt, and produced quite detailed documents that would be hard to refute.  There may be people who still think the Soviets are innocent in the matter, but I fear they are on not much less shaky ground than the alluded-to flat-earthers, or perhaps, to choose a more relevant analogy, [[Holocaust deniers]]. --[[User:Delirium|Delirium]] 12:03, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

OK, now it has been improved, although I don't expect it to stay that way for long. I think it's a difficult question, and certainly not one I'm qualified to grapple with. But I can come up with a few thoughts about it. Clearly, in the West, Soviet guilt is pretty much unquestioned in mainstream history. When you come at it that way it looks like a question of the notability of the view, not the accuracy of the view&amp;mdash;is the view of Nazi guilt notable enough to warrant this balanced treatment, and if so to what degree? But on the other hand, what is the view in, say, Russia? How do the competing views compare in terms of notability there? I'm ''guessing''&amp;mdash;I don't know this&amp;mdash;that the view of Nazi guilt is probably a good bit common there, perhaps mainstream and in practical competition with the view of Soviet guilt. So I think it's a complex question that requires a lot of consideration. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 09:15, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I, too, have seen some compelling arguments aimed at blaming the Nazis for the Katyn massacre. My history prof introduced the issue neutrally. Simply put, when the site of the massacre was discovered, the Nazis blamed the Soviets and the Soviets blamed the Nazis. People today are too quick to jump to the conclusion that the Soviets are responsible for the killings just because the Nazis discovered the site. The Nazis may be responsible for the massacre: they were certainly masters of propaganda. If they are in fact responsible, the issue parallels the Reichstag fire in 1933. I'm not saying they are responsible, I'm simply pointing out that we can't justify either POV 100%. I believe that the article should be represented more neutrally than has been done. -Maria [[User:24.68.123.204|24.68.123.204]] 04:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:When did you take the history class?  The kind of ambivalent view that you are proposing might have been justified, if only just barely, before 1989.  However, since then the Soviet Union and then Russia have admitted that the Soviets carried out the massacre, have produced the original documents in which the order was given by Stalin's politburo, and exhumed additional mass graves in places which the German army never reached, removing any possibility that the dead in those mass graves were killed by the Germans.  In short, after those revelations there is no longer the slightest doubt among serious historians as to who carried out the massacre.  Those who wish to question the facts even in the face of this overwhelming evidence verge on engaging in denial. [[User:Balcer|Balcer]] 07:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

This Ned guy is a highly annoying. His hysterical anti-Marxist and anti-progressive rhetoric has got no place in a web site that strives to maintain balance of its subjects. Even the contributers of the immensely anti-communist &quot;Black Book of Communism&quot; work have conceded that the conventional history in regard to Yezhov's purge of military officers have been quite exaggerated. 30,000 out of 178,000 relevant cadres were effected. Has anyone else taken into consideration that Poland unleashed aggression on revolutionary Russia during the Civil War and Intervention years that resulted in considerable cession of territory? [[User:Zvesda|Zvesda]]

Anyone who denounces communist criminal behavior is anti-progressive! I thought I had heard it all until now. I suppose that is the typical Marxist mentality, whose idea of progress is the advance of one world socialist revolution. I'm sure Stalin viewed Katyn as &quot;progress&quot; too.

There are also many tales, although the authenticity unknown, of many escaped POWs who claimed it was the Soviets, and the Polish believed them to be crazy. This would be nice to include as well. I'll see what I can come up with.

:Never heard of any escapees... There were several hundred (ca. 300, if memory serves me right) prisoners who were on the killing lists, but were instead transferred to a special NKVD villa, where they were kept as a reservoir of Polish officers in case Stalin needed them. One of them was even returned from the railway station, some 500 metres from the mass murder site, and his testimony is quite notable.

==&quot;Massacre&quot;, &quot;Incident&quot;, &quot;Execution&quot; ?==
I found this on someone's talk page tonight:

'''On Wikipedia''': Soviet troops shooting Polish army officers is a ''[[Katyn Massacre|massacre]]''.  
US troops shooting Korean civilians is an ''[[No Gun Ri incident|incident]]''.

I suggest we rename this page the &quot;Katyn incident&quot;.  If American troops can gun down unarmed civilans and it be called an &quot;incident&quot;, to pacify  American [[jingoist]]s , I think it is only fair that we rename this  massacre, involving military POWs an incident too.

::Well, firstly, I don't think we should hold this article hostage of any other article. If the No Gun Ri incident is known as such in English - that's fine with me, but it mustn't be the same with this article. 

::Having said that, I think that this article's title might indeed need some revision. What is the most popular name in English? In Polish it seems to be ''Zbrodnia katy≈Ñska'', or ''the crime of Katyn'' in English.. [[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User talk:Halibutt|tt]] 08:35, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

::::I feel like ''execution'' somehow assumed some sort of guilt from the executed (maybe imagined by the executioners). I do not think it was the case, unless we will consider credible accusation that some prisoners somehow conspired with the Nazi. So I am personally for ''massacre''. On the other hand the beginning of the third section ''Up to 99% of the remaining prisoners were subsequently '''murdered'''. People from Kozielsk were '''murdered''' in the usual mass '''murder''' site of Smolensk country, called Katyn forest; people from Starobielsk were '''murdered''' in the inner NKVD prison of Kharkov and the bodies were buried near Pyatikhatki; and police officers from Ostashkov were '''murdered'''... '' does not look NPOV. If some murders would be change to massacres, executions or killing it would increase the readability of the section without acquitting the perpetrators of the massacre.

As far as I know, &quot;Katyn Massacre&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Katyn Forest Massacre&quot; is the usual name in English.

To me having the Polish name here implies that this is purely a Polish related event and I very much don't think so. This speaks about the Stalin regime a lot, thus it is very much SU related.

OK, do I take it that you support riddance of &quot;≈Ñ&quot;? Now as to whether it was a massacre, please do not label me a Holocaust denier but it was not. Execution of prionsers is a War Crime but not necessarily of Massacre which bears the flavor of mass killing of the civilian population during the hostilities, and usually includes murder of women and chlildren. This was a war crime no doubt. In RU/UA sources it is usually called a ''Katyn Tragedy'' but I am not sure &quot;tragedy&quot; bodes well into a WP article title. Any other suggestions?

:Could we discuss one at a time ? I'd leave the &quot;≈Ñ&quot; quretion for later discussion if it's all right with you.

Why are you saying that &quot;a massacre usually includes murder of women and chlildren&quot; ? Also, according to google, the name is &quot;Katy≈Ñ massacre&quot;.

OK, I checked the dictionary and the meaning of massacre is more inclusive than the perception I had. I would use &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;incident&quot;, but fine, let's keep it if so many editors would like to use this term. I also withdraw my objection to &quot;≈Ñ&quot;.

I recently NPOVed the header after Ghirlandajo's edits. Firts of all, the name he proposes (&quot;katyn incident&quot;) is completely unknown to the world. It gives [http://www.google.pl/search?hs=F3H&amp;hl=pl&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Apl-PL%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Katyn+incident%22&amp;btnG=Szukaj&amp;lr= 203] links in Google, as opposed to [http://www.google.pl/search?hs=O3H&amp;hl=pl&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Apl-PL%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Katyn+massacre%22&amp;btnG=Szukaj&amp;lr= 29,600] for &quot;Katyn massacre&quot; and additional [http://www.google.pl/search?q=%22Katyn+forest+massacre%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl-PL:official 13,800] for &quot;Katyn forest massacre&quot;. Which gives some 220:1 odds against the proposed version...

As to the view that the Germans were responsible, I believe we should at least cite some credible source or historian to mention that in the header. [[Holocaust denial]] is not mentioned in the header of the articles on [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] or [[The Holocaust]], so I doubt we should mention it here. Especially that it is against established facts and mentioning it as an equally-valid view would be promotion of certain rare POV, not maintaining NPOV. But of course Ghirlandajo reverted my edits, so I doubt anything could be done... [[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User talk:Halibutt|tt]] 10:15, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

The Polish exiled authorities, sitting in London and selling its allies,  got caught by this hitlerite provocation and as a result during WWII additional millions of soldiers of USSR, UK, USA and Germany were killed. In order to denude the Russian allies and to give a nudge on the countries of the Western Europe and NATO, the scum of Central Committee of KPSU, Procurators' Office of the USSR and Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation have reanimated the provocation in the 1980's. For students of law faculties and for all who consider Russia their Motherland.''

:::::Balcer, your comment is a huge dissapointment for me. I was thinking that there was at least one Pole not brainwashed by Polish prop, but now I see this is not the case. Firstly, noone denies that the execution did happen. Who perpetrated it is a completely different question. As i said above, if this is encyclopedia and it presumes to be objective, then it should mention various points of view and not a single one. Wikipedia is free for everyone to edit, and every reasonable point of view should be mentioned therein. What I see now is that there is a point of view that the crimes was perpetrated by the Nazis and that its adherents have some evidence to back up their claims. When I used yandex search, it became clear to me that this point of view is quite popular (not in Poland, you may be sure). So I can't understand why there are editors who should be strongly opposed to take this point of view seriously and prefer not to mention it in the article which they seem to have privatized for themselves. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirlandajo]] 20:08, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Attempts at denial ==

The actions of some editors attempting to edit the article to imply that the basic facts of the Katy≈Ñ massacre are in dispute are reprehensible.  There is a limit to how far the idea of NPOV can go, and it surely stops once attempts are made to deny basic historical facts accepted by overwhelming concensus.  If these actions persist, they will seriously harm the credibility of Wikipedia, and may bring unwelcome attention to Wikipedia's reliability as a historical source from the media (which we have seen too much of recently, see [[John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy]] and [http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=wikipedia latest Google news stories]) [[User:Balcer|Balcer]] 18:08, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:To quote [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]]:
::We can certainly include long discussions that present our moral repugnance to such things; in doing so, we can maintain a healthy, consistent support for the neutral point of view by attributing the view to prominent representatives or to some group of people. Others will be able to make up their own minds and, being reasonable, surely come around to our view.
:and:
::the Wikipedia neutrality policy certainly does ''not'' state, or imply, that we must &quot;give equal validity&quot; to minority views. It does state that we must not take a stand on them ''qua'' encyclopedia writers; but that does not stop us from describing the majority views as ''such''; from fairly explaining the strong arguments against the pseudoscientific theory; from describing the strong moral repugnance that many people feel toward some morally repugnant views; and so forth.
:If the problem, on the other hand, is not with describing minority POVs (and determining how widespread a minority POV is can be a whole different can of worms), but rather with some editors trying insert their particular POV into articles, then it can be addressed through negotiations or, if all else fails, [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution]].

::The point is: how small does the minority have to get before we lock its bizarre views out of Wikipedia?  I am certain, for example, that you could find small groups in the US which believe that the US government is run by extraterrestials, but those views surely do not belong in a Wikipedia entry on [[Federal government of the United States|US government]].  More to the point, most of our current articles related to the [[Holocaust]] do not present [[Holocaust Denial]] as an equally valid view, in fact they do not even mention it as the minority view (as articles on [[Belzec]], [[Majdanek]], [[Treblinka]] etc. do not state in the lead: A minority of people believes this never happened).  [[User:Balcer|Balcer]] 18:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:::The size of the minority that holds dissenting views is undoubtedly relevant. As [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] states:
::::''views held only by a '''tiny''' minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and '''perhaps should not be represented at all'''''.
:::The trick, however, is determining just how tiny the minority is. Have there been any public opinion surveys in Russia?
:::As far as the comparison with the listed death camps goes, the difference here is that there is only one article that covers the Katyn massacre and there are many that cover the Holocaust. If you compare the amount of space dedicated to Holocaust denial and associated topics by Wikipedia, it accounts for a rather large part of the total Holocaust material here.
:::Having said that, there are different ways to cover minority opinions. You can have a separate article which lists minority arguments or you can have a section at the end of the main article or any number of other ways. But the important thing is that we are not doing original research and we are not taking sides here, we are simply trying to describe all the non-trivial POVs out there. If there is a significant minority POV that holds a different opinion, be it Katyn or [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] or [[Shaver Mystery]], we don't want to take sides, we just describe them as fairly as we can. [[User:Ahasuerus|Ahasuerus]] 19:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I would have no problem with a section at the end dealing with attempts to deny the basic facts of the massacre, and other editors have already suggested this approach.  I have a serious problem with some editors trying to question these facts in the lead, presenting the discretited view that the Germans have carried out the massacre as equally viable.  

::::By the way, are you serious about using public opinion polls to determine what the content of Wikipedia should be?  Let me quote [[George Carlin]] here: ''Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that''.[[User:Balcer|Balcer]] 19:25, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::Public opinion surveys are useful when there is no other way to determine how widespread a particular minority opinion is. For example, there are very few elected officials in the US who publicly use anti-semitic rhetoric these days, but carefully worded/parsed/weighed/etc public opinion surveys suggest that 12% to 17% of US citizens subscribe to some form of anti-semitism. Listing these results in Wikipedia (with links to Gallup et al) would be perfectly legitimate. Similarly, I am unaware of any governments or peer reviewed publications that still endorse the view that the Katyn massacre was committed by the Nazis, but if there is a non-trivial amount of public opinion support for the idea, then it should be noted.

[[User:Ahasuerus|Ahasuerus]]

::::::::Exactly so, but using public opinion to determine the factual accuracy of historic events is an original research performed by editors of Wikipedia, and not by the public. --[[User:Lysy|Lysy]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Lysy|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 20:48, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::::::If we tried to use poll results to determine ''factual accuracy of historic events'', it would certainly yield all kinds of interesting results. I wonder who won the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] according to the public? :) However, the proposal currently under discussion is much more modest in scope and has to do with covering minority opinions in the article. As [[WP:NPOV]] states, ''Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, which means it is a representation of human knowledge at some level of generality ... for the purposes of working on Wikipedia ... &quot;human knowledge&quot; includes all different '''significant''' theories on all different topics''. Thus a theory doesn't have to be &quot;true&quot;, just &quot;significant&quot;, to be included. For example, the notion that the German army was &quot;backstabbed&quot; in November 1918 was not well supported by the evidence available in 1925 or shared by any &quot;reputable sources&quot;, but it was popular in the 1920s nonetheless and proved important in Hitler's rise to power. With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, we now know that if there had been a Wikipedia in 1925, its editors would have been well advised to describe this theory even if they had considered it to be without basis in fact. Of course, there is no way of telling ahead of time which popular theories may become important in the future and which ones may fade away, so we use their current popularity as the main criterion for inclusion/exclusion.

:::::::::And again, just to make sure that we are all on the same page, I am not suggesting that we should give equal time to all theories, only that we should describe minority theories (no matter how unconvincing or odious you may find them personally) as well. [[User:Ahasuerus|Ahasuerus]] 21:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::::::::::Certainly yes, then. However it would be best to refer the sources of the alternative theories, and explain their (in)significance in proper context.

=== Katyn and Holocaust ===

To say the truth, I'm quite shocked at Balcer's comparison of Katyn and Holocaust. It seemed to me fairly certain that any attempt to compare the Holocaust with other killings should be considered offensive per se, as it results in belittling of the Holocaust's unique tragedy. No I see that there are people, at least in Poland, who are eager to compare the execution of several thousand officers with a wide-scale annihilation of the nation, including children, women, civilians. As awful as it is, such executions as the former were a fairly common thing under Stalin's criminal regime. If it was NKVD who perpetrated the crime, I don't see why Katyn should be distiniguished from similar and even more ghastly executions carried on by the same organization. We should keep in mind that the officers executed there were the same that prepared the projected Polish invasion of the Soviet Union in 1939. They were not angels, to say the least. Polish historians forget to mention that thousnads of Soviet POWs died from hunger in Pilsudski's concentration camps after they had been taken captive during the Polish-Soviet War. So I can't compare Katyn with Holocaust, sorry. I hope that Balcer will apologize for his inept and disgusting comment. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirlandajo]] 20:22, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::Ghirlandajo has developed a nasty habit of ascribing to other editors attitudes which they do not hold and putting words into their mouths.

Nowhere did I make a claim like that in my comments.  
::What I did say was that decent people do put certain limits on the range of views which they tolerate in mainstream discourse, and by extension on Wikipedia.  [[Holocaust Denial]] is an example of a view, held by a small minority, which is not allowed to be presented as a valid alternative to mainstream views.  Similarly, I believe the same approach should apply to those who wish to deny well documented historical atrocities committed by the Soviet regime.

::The problem of Poland was that practically every educated male was a reserve officer.

:I don't know anything about the Polish or Soviet military, but in the U.S., even in wartime, there is a distinction between the regular army (ordinary soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers), and the reserves, even if the reserves have been recalled to active duty.  For example, members of the National Guard were called to active duty during the Vietnam war and have been in the Iraq wars as well.  Could that distinction apply here -- e.g., not only officers in Poland's standing army, but also officers who had been in the reserves?  ‚Äî [[User:OtherDave|OtherDave]] 13:58, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

=== officers taken prisoner during the course of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 ===

OR ONLY during the WWII.
Howe many links give Google for Polish Defensive War and WWII.I think WWII its better why Polish Defensive War is completely unknown to the world.
: Saying WWII would be a dangerous generalization, since Soviets basically changed sides - in 1939 they were allied with Nazis against Poland, but from 1941 they fought against the Nazis and were (nominally) Poland's allies. Soviets were not taking Polish POWs during the IIWW proper (Great Patriotic War), only during the [[Polish Defensive War]] (perhaps better known as the Polish September Campaign). IIWW began for Poland in 1939, but for Soviets only in 1941. On another note, the term POW is also not fullproof: [https://www.cia.gov/csi/studies/winter99-00/art6.html Fisher wrotes]: &quot;Strictly speaking, even the Polish servicemen were not POWs. The USSR had not declared war, and the Polish commander in chief had ordered his troops not to engage Soviet forces.&quot;.--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:10, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

::That's a rather messy area. &quot;World War II&quot; was a super-conflict that encompassed multiple conflicts over a 6 year period. The &quot;core&quot; conflict was the familiar confrontation between the Axis and the Allies, but many countries changed allegiance as circumstances changed. For example, in May 1940 the French and the British were fighting Germany together, but by July 1940 their were fighting each other at Mers-el-Kebir. Moreover, some countries had multiple competing self-proclaimed governments (France, Poland, the Baltics) throughout the war, which makes things even more complicated. Other countries (e.g. Finland, Japan), spent much of the war fighting some (but not all) Allied countries, and so on and so forth. The Soviet Union was Germany's semi-ally in 1939-1940 in the grand old &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tradition (&quot;we'll cheer you on and send you raw materials while we are digesting chunks of Poland, Romania, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia&quot;), but the relationship quickly soured in the second half of 1940 once there was nothing left to divide in Europe except the Balkans.

::The question, however, is whether the &quot;Polish Defensive War of 1939&quot; is the best term to describe the Polish-German war of 1939 and googling on either ww.google.com or print.google.com suggests otherwise.

::The problem with the terms related to the war of 1939 is at least half a century old. Half of the &quot;war with Germany&quot; of 1939 was fought against the Soviets on a second front. Hence the term [[war]] is more appropriate than [[Military campaign|campaign]] (the war of 1939 consisted of two campaigns, one in the east and one in the west). It is well-explained at [[Talk:Polish September Campaign]] - as well as the reasons why the term used in Wikipedia, though more popular, is also technically wrong.

Almost all bullets were of caliber 7,65 mm with a stamp 'Geco 7,65 D' at the bottom. Geco is the abbreviation of 'Gustav Genschow &amp; Co.'. This ammnunition factory was located in Durlach, close to Karlsruhe in Germany. The ammunition used in Katyn was procuced between 1922-1931. 
Because of restrictions of the Versailles Treaty it was difficult to sell ammunition in Germany. The company Genschow therefore exported ammuntion to countries like Poland, the Baltic states, also to the Sovietunion. (source: 'Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Katyn', 1943 Berlin)

The question of how they got there needs clarfication.

Yes, it looks indeed somewhat strange. As I said already, the date 1941 is not recognizable on the document, but on the German explanation below. Either it is a simple printing mistake, or it refers to the duration of the certification of the cizienship of the captain Kozlinski (?)(in Polish: ''po≈õwiadczenie obywatelstwa''). The document looks like it has been folded many times. It does not specifically say that it was found in the mass graves in Katyn, but one should assume so. Neither is the name of the captain mentioned on the list of those found and to a great deal identified (all in all 4143 bodies), which is also incorporated in the book (I checked twice, still might have missed to see the name). 
However it looks like you have a vivid interest in the document. So, I offer to send anybody who is interested a scan of the page. May be you regognize some more details. My Polish is limited. Drop me a message under ''kromber@aol.com'' and you will have the scan. 
I never heard that all documents refering to Katyn were burned in Dresden. Why Dresden? Dresden never played an important role in hiding documents. This book was published in 1943 and distributed apparently throughout Germany. Otherwise we won't have any copies anymore.

Actually I've got a scan of the page, but I was afraid that it could be Photoshop-made - [[:ru:–ò–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ:Amtliches Material p330.jpg]] Small correction - in 1945 Germans burned 14 boxes (containers) with Katyn documents on a railway station near Dresden - they evacuated them to the West and were afraid that Soviets captured them. (Source - &quot;Katyn's syndrome in Soviet-Polish relations&quot; by Ja≈æborovskaja and others &lt;In Russian&gt;). Of course they published in 1943 some selected document in the book for propaganda purpose. Another interesting question is why his name is absent in the list. I read that list of names has strange lacunas - like after #17 goes #23 and so on. Apparently he was removed from the list like many others. Germans did their job very inaccurate - they removed name, but forgot to remove document and even more so - they probably retouched photo removing the date - but forgot to remove date from the explanation line. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 22:48, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

::If the document we're talking about is [[:Image:Amtliches Material p330.jpg|this one]], then the riddle is solved. Although little can be seen on the scan, it must've been issued before the war and not during it. First of all, it's a ''certificate of Polish citizenship''. I can hardly imagine the Nazi authorities who conquered Poland and tried to erase her name from all maps issued anything but a ''Certificate of General Government's citizenship''. Secondly, it's written in Polish and not in German, unlike all war-time documents of both civil and military administration of the General Government. Third thing is the address that could be identified as ''Miodowa'' street. During the German occupation the street was renamed after some Nazi bonzo, I don't remember which one but could check it. Then, the date of issue (and the number of the document) is hardly visible in the top left, but with 90% certainity it's 1/7/1938- which would suggest [[July 1]], [[1938]]. On the other hand I can't see anything resembling the date given in the caption... Finally, the bottom line says ''This form was issued to be presented at the [[Warsaw University]]''. The Warsaw University was closed by the Germans as soon as they got into Warsaw in 1939 and was not reopened until 1945. 

::So, all in all the date (which can't be seen at all at the scan, BTW), must've been the date of expiry rather than date of issue. As simple as that. Also, perhaps Stefan Alfred Ko≈∫li≈Ñski, to whom the document was issued, was not among the identified, though he certainly is on the Katyn List (check [http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_K.html here] for ''Kozlinski Stefan Alfred''.

== Spelling ==

Why do you write Katy≈Ñ (massacre) in the headline instead of Katyn? Katyn is a place in Russia. The original spelling is –∫–∞—Ç—ã–Ω—å. The English transcription would be Katyn. There is no ≈Ñ in the English alphabet. I realize this is a minor thing but one should be as accurate as possible.
:Katy≈Ñ is a Polish spelling, as the massacre is much more known in Poland then in Russia (or in English speaking countries).--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

I was aware of the fact that it is the Polish spelling. I am also aware that practically every school child in Poland knows about Katyn. But this is not the issue. The issue is strictly a linguistic one. The Polish transpription of K–∞—Ç—ã–Ω—å into Katy≈Ñ is absolutely perfect, because it expresses the soft sign '—å' at the end of the Russian word. The Polish transcription is more appropriate than the English one. However, this article is an English one. The English language/alphabet simply does not provide any soft sign. Therefore it has to be omitted in the English transcription. It is only confusing for an English reader to be confronted with an '≈Ñ'. You would not accept any English transcriptions in an Polish Wikipedia article either. For example '–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞' to 'Moscow', instead of 'Moskwa', or '–°–∏–±–∏—Ä—å' to 'Siberia' instead of 'Syberia'. So why do you impose the Polish transcription on an English article? Once again it is a minor point, but the Wikipedians strive to be as accurate as possible in their articles, and this transcription is simply not correct. So, do or don't do what you please, but be aware it is a mistake.
By the way my mother tongue is not English (nor Russian, nor Polish). So, you cannot claim that my point of view is a nationalistic one.

:If the [[Russia|Russian]] spelling for the place name, as given above, is correct, then the above comment is very much ''√† propos'' and the name should be spelled either &quot;Katyn,&quot; as it is in English, or &quot;Katyn',&quot; as it would commonly be [[transliteration|transliterated]] from Russian into English.

On April 13 Berlin Radio announced this find to the world: ''&quot;A great pit was found, 28 metres long and 16 metres wide, filled with twelve layers of bodies of Polish officers, numbering about 3,000. They were clad in full military uniform, and while many of them had their hands tied, all of them had wounds in the back of their necks caused by pistol shots. The identification of the bodies will not cause great difficulties because of the mummifying property of the soil and because the Bolsheviks had left on the bodies the identity documents of the victims.

The Bolsheviks can be very cruel.&quot;'' However at the same time, on April 24, Churchill assured the Soviets: ''&quot;We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism.&quot;'' Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair is laconic.

The article uses an statement allegedly written by Goebbels (&quot;Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers&quot;) and refers to (Zawodney, 1962). It's not just an unimportant quotation because it indicates that he takes the blame for that massacre which might contradict the entire article. Therefore, I'd like to see a reference to that statement in a reliable record of his diary to ensure its validty. --[[User:Anti-Flag|Anti-Flag]] 18:53, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

::Using the book's index, I checked every reference to Katyn and did not find that quote. Here are some others you might find helpful though (unsurprisingly, the typos are all mine):

----
pg 328, April 14, 1943 - &quot;We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the GPU, for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals to the spot where they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome. They Fuehrer has also given permission for us to hand out a drastic news item to the german press. I gave instructions to make the widest possible use of the propaganda material. We shall be able to live on it for a couple weeks&quot;

pg 332, April 17, 1943 - &quot;The Katyn incident is developing into a gigantic political affair which may have wide represcussions. We are exploiting it in every manner possible. So long as ten to twelve thousand polish victims have sacrificed their lives anyway - probably not entirely without their fault, for they were the real instigators of this war - they might as well now serve to open the eyes of the peoples of Europe about Bolshevism. 

In the evening, a Globe Reuter reporter reached us containing a declartion by the Polish Government-in-exile. This declaration changes the whole Katyn affair fundementally in that the Polish Government-in-exile now demands that the International Red Cross take part in the investigation. That suits us perfectly. I immediately contacted the Fuehrer, who gave me permission to send a telegram to the International Red Cross, requesting it to collaborate to the greatest extenet possible in identifying corpses. This telegram is signed by the Duke of Colburg and Gotha, whose name is well known in England and who has many family connections there. In that way, in my opinion, something has been started the reprecussions of which we simply can't imagine yet.&quot; 

pg 384, April 30, 1943 - Our propaganda is suspected everywhere of having blown up the Katyn incident to enable us to make a seperate peace either with the English or the Soviets. That, of course, is not our intention, although such a possiblity would naturally be very pleasing. 


pg 354, May 8, 1943 - Unfortunately, German munitions were found in the graves of Katyn. The question of how they got there needs clarfication. It is either a case of munitions sold by us during hte period of our friendly arrangement with the Soviet Russians, or of the Soviets themselves throwing these munitions into the graves. In any case it is essential that this incident be kept top secret. If it were to come to the knowledge of the enemy the whole Katyn affair would have to be dropped. 

page 366, May 10, 1943 - The fuehrer is very much impressed with the Katyn incident. It showed him what tremendous possiblities are still inherent in anti-Bolshevik propaganda.... The wermacht has no buisness to interfere in this matter. It should concern itself with military questions only. Questions of psychology are exclusively the conern of the Propaganda Ministry

*Reference 19 (&quot;The Polish Government official statement&quot;) is a primary source and therefore cannot be used.
*&lt;strike&gt;Reference 18 (&quot;Europe: A History&quot;, 1392 pages) unfortunately is not accessible to me and needs backup.

*Reference 20 (&quot;Collaboration in the Holocaust&quot;) again seems to be the attempt to use books that the contributors are unlikely to own in order to pretend validity.

Therefore, I'd like this paragraph to be removed, as it is interpreting the intentions of Stalin and in fact has nothing to do with the topic, or be backed up with sources which are easily accessible.

== Suggestion ==

Would not it be better if somebody would put a coherent [[Alternative versions of the Katyn massacre]], there he/she would point out all the grievances with the mainstream version of the events and their opponents could demonstrate the weak points with their explanations. Obviously, it should be published somewhere because of [[WP:NOR]].

Then in the main article we could just insert a phrase like ''Some historians are still supporting the [[Alternative versions of the Katyn massacre]]''. This way we could avoid the revert war that may prevent the article to get the FA status. 

Putting alternative versions into a separate article is not something new in wikipedia, see e.g. [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] or [[Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina]] or [[Examination of Holocaust denial]]. [[User:Alex Bakharev|abakharev]] 22:36, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

To tell the truth I disagree with almost every other phrase of the article :) (because of their‚Äôs POV, inaccuracy and direct misleadings) and the whole article‚Äôs concept. But nevertheless lets concentrate on &lt;u&gt;some&lt;/u&gt; noticeable inaccurcies putting aside the question about who in reality killed the Polish officeres. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 17:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

===Discovery===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;The fate of the missing prisoners remained unknown until April 1943 when the German Wehrmacht discovered the mass grave of more than 4,000 Polish military reserve officers in the forest on Goat Hill near Katyn. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate. '''

In March, 1942 Poles working in German auxiliary unit  had discovred the graves and reported about it to Germans.  
Here emerges the question as to why Germans didn‚Äôt start their propaganda campaign in 1942 (hint: maybe because bodies &lt;if officeres were killed in the fall of 1941&gt; were not decomposed enough). 

That‚Äôs important information (about discovery in 1942) and without it the article cannot be called comprehensive. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 17:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well, indeed. The article is written from the perspective of the world, not the Wehrmacht. Also, I never heard that the people to discover the mass graves were ''Poles working for the German auxiliary unit''. In fact I heard of Poles serving in the Wehrmacht, though not in [[Hiwis|auxiliary units]] - and definitely not in the Katyn context. In fact I heard that in 1942 there were but rumours reaching the Germans from the local civilians, though I can't find the relevant part in Swianiewicz's ''W cieniu Katynia'' nor Dembi≈Ñski's ''Najnowsze dokumenty...''.

===The International Red Cross===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Allies were aware that the Nazis had found a mass grave as the discovery transpired, via radio transmissions intercepted and decrypted by Bletchley Park. German and the International Red Cross, which was invited by Germany, investigated the Katyn corpses and soon produced physical evidence that the massacre took place in early 1940, at a time when the area was still under Soviet control.[18][17]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate. '''

The International Red Cross didn‚Äôt participate in this investigation. When in April 17, 1943 Germany and the Polish government in exile, simultaneously asked International Red Cross to investigate the case the IRC replied that it couldn‚Äôt do it without the Soviet request. So, the IRC didn‚Äôt investigate anything in Katyn. 

What you are reffering to is the Techical Comission of the Polish Red Cross that was formed from  Poles who were on the territory occupied by Germans. The Techical Comission of the Polish Red Cross didn‚Äôt investigate anything either. They collected documents from the bodies under control of German secret Police.

However there were also so-called Internetional Forensic Commision represented by doctors from Axis and occupied countries and one Swiss. They were not able to draw a conclusion from the bodies‚Äô condition and dated the time of murder by documents dated earlier than April 1940 which were found on bodies. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 17:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:Indeed, the IRC should be replaced with the explanation on the international commission. Though your assumptions that they ''couldn't draw a conclusion'' is not exactly right. According to, for instance, [http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_vanvliet.html van Vliet's report] states clearly that they ''cautioned the entire group to do no talking, to give no indications of opinion, and not to cooperate in any way with the Germans. All agreed. It was evident to all of us that we were involved in an international mess with terrific political implications''. Then he passes on to say that he believed ''that the Russians did it.

:Skarzynski was directed by Polish Red Cross officials to go to supervise the exhumation and proper reburial of these Polish officers. While at Katyn, the Polish Red Cross official was moved by the facts he personally witnessed to admit that the German Army in this instance was innocent

===The Polish government in exile===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;In April 1943, when the Polish government in exile insisted on bringing this matter to the negotiation table with Soviets and on an investigation by the International Red Cross[19][18] Stalin accused the Polish government in exile of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke diplomatic relations with it.[20] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate. '''

Stalin broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile BECAUSE it didn‚Äôt bring this matter to the negotiation table with Soviets first. Instead of that they in one day with Germans made request to the International Red Cross not even asked Soviets for any explanations and more so ‚Äì started anti-Soviet campaign in Polish-controlled press. It‚Äôs an absolutelly clear matter and you can read details in the published Correspondence between Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt during WWII. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 17:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:Wrong again. Stalin was repeatedly asked about the matter and he refused to cooperate (hence the Manchuria talk and all that gibberish) between the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement and 1943. He was asked both through diplomatical notes, at the negotiation table (even during the first meeting with Anders, as per his ''Bez ostatniego rozdzia≈Çu'', page 160). Allen Paul in his ''Katy≈Ñ: Stalin's massacre...'' even mentions (page 115) that even [[Zygmunt Berling]] asked Beria of the fate of the missing officers as early as 1940 (and the latter was to reply that they ''made a gross mistake with them'', BTW). 

:After the German revelations, the Polish government issued a statement on [[April 17]], [[1943]]. It's available in full [http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_statement.html here]. Among other things, it says, among other things, that ''The Polish Government have instructed their representative in Switzerland to request the International Red Cross in Geneva to send a delegation to investigate the true state of affairs on the spot (...) At the same time, however, the Polish Government, on behalf of the Polish Nation, deny to the Germans any right to base on a crime they ascribe to others, arguments in their own defence. The profoundly hypocritical indignation of German propaganda will not succeed in concealing from the World the many cruel and reiterated crimes still being perpetrated against the Polish people''.

:Now, according to Swianiewicz (page 316 in the Czytelnik edition of 1990), the reason for breaking the diplomatic relations was the fact that the Poles referred to the International Red Cross. Anders at page 160 quotes the Russian comunicate of April 15 and then on the following page he states that ''The Soviet government assumed that the Polish plea to the International Red Cross was enough to break diplomatical relations with Poland'' (my translation). He then continues that ''in the note of April 25, the Soviet government accused Polish government of collaboration with Hitler in that propaganda campaign related to the finding of graves of the Polish officers near Smolensk. The note said that &quot;All these circumstances force the Soviet government to announce that the current government of Poland, by entering a path of collaboration with Hitler's government, ceased to continue allied relations with the Soviet Union and became its enemy. (...) Because of that, the Soviet government decided to break relations with the Polish government&quot;''. Do we have the original, full text of the note that would say more on the matter than the fragment republished by Anders? [[User:Halibutt|Halibu]][[User talk:Halibutt|tt]] 23:13, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
::I probably was not clear enough. I know about Polish requests to Stalin in the winter of 1941. I mean that AFTER the German revelation in April 13, 1943 Polish government in exile didn't try to consult about this new situation with Soviet government (which would be natural for allies) and instead of that in April 17 it made it's request to the International Red Cross without any consultations wiyh Soviets. And that's was enough to break diplomatical relations with Polish government in exile. The correspondence between Stalin and Churchill is available in internet [http://eroplan.boom.ru/bibl/stalin/sc/sc43_04.htm] See doc. 150-159 &lt;in Russian&gt;

:Anders explains that the true reason for asking the Red Cross was the Soviet press release claiming that the Polish POWs were ''woriking on a construction site near Smolensk and were captured by the Germans in 1941''. Anders concluded that everybody felt that there must be something fishy there as the Soviets could give such explanation any time between 1941 and 1943 - yet they did not. And the excerpt of the Soviet note of April 25 does not mention the IRC as the reason. Do you have any sources to back such version up?

===Removing evidence===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Having retaken the Katyn area almost immediately after the Red Army had recaptured Smolensk, Soviet Union begun the cover-up, with NKVD destroying a cemetery the Germans had permitted the Polish Red Cross to build and removing other evidence.[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Not neutral'''

:When you change a light bulb you dont have to cut the lamp in pieces, do you.

===The Burdenko Commission===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Burdenko Commission, headed by Nikolai Burdenko, the President of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR, exhumed the bodies again and reached the conclusion that the shooting was done in 1941, when the Katyn area was under German occupation. No foreign personnel, including the Polish communists, were allowed to join the Burdenko Commission.[1] [3] This forms a sharp contrast with the German investigation, which allowed wider access to both international press and organizations (like the Red Cross) and even used Polish workers, like J√≥zef Mackiewicz[24].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate and not neutral. '''

Soviets did allow access to international press and others (one of them ‚Äì daughter of American ambassador). Also Polish Corps buried remains after exhumation works were finished.

The comparison between the German and the Soviet investigations is not neutral. On the other hand it could be said that Germans made public propaganda campaign out of the investigation while the Soviet commission concentrated on the practice work having to investigate much more pits and graves with killed Soviet citizens all over Soviet Union. For example in Smolensk area they also found 87 mass graves with 135,000 killed Soviet citizens and POWs. And unlike forensic experts in the pro-German commission who cannot date the murder from bodies‚Äô state and had to rely on the found documents with dates, Soviet specialists were much more experienced. --[[User:Nekto|Nekto]] 17:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:As far as I remember the German report (don't have any sources on it at hand), it simply stated that the muddy and wet soil of the area made the corpses too ''waxy'' for exact date to be given. They could only tell that there must've passed at least several years since the burials. On the other hand, the Soviets indeed miraculously found the evidence that the Poles were buried in the summer of 1941. So, all in all, two years after the massacre (as per the version accepted by almost everyone) it was impossible to tell the exact time of the mass murder, while 4 years after the shootings it was somehow easier...

===Two US POWS===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Two US POWS were brought by Germans to Katyn in 1943 for an international news conference. The ranking officer was Col. John H. Van Vliet who in 1945 wrote a report concluding that the Soviets, not the Germans, were responsible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Stewart's suspicions of the German purpose was indicated by his testimony to the effect &quot;that I was there [Katyn] under orders; that I felt the matter was a propaganda effort, and, in any event, it was a political effort. I had no desire to have anything to do with a propaganda effort or a political matter.&quot;
:Van Vliet in his written report stated: &quot;I hated the Germans. I didn't want to believe them. When I became involved in the visit to Katyn I realized that the Germans would do their best to convince me that Russia was guilty. I made up my mind not to be convinced by what must be a propaganda effort

:It is particularly noteworthy that both officers independently emphasized the same convincing factor, which they both stated had not been brought to their attention by the Germans but which was an independent deduction from their own observations. This was the evident fact that the clearly undisturbed corpses were clothed in winter attire which was in an excellent state of repair, showing practically no wear. The two officers also independently made these same observations about the condition of the boots of the Polish officers. In both instances the officers stated from their own personal experience as prisoners of war in a German camp that clothing could not have remained in that condition if it had been worn for a year in a prison camp.
::I have no doubts that Van Vliet was a plain and honest guy. He honestly admitted:  ‚ÄúAfter all, I‚Äôm no expert in body-decomposition.‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have thought about this a lot in the past seven years, and freely admit that there never was presented to me any single piece of evidence that could be taken as an absolute proof.‚Äù So the rest is just his personal pure speculations over the case (i.e. POV). It‚Äôs an interesting reading but it proves nothing. Although‚Ä¶ this last passage can be taken in favour of the Soviet version:

::‚ÄúThe uniforms on the bodies were obviously of the best material and tailor-made. The footwear appeared to be of the best and included many pairs that were obviously made to order. The uniforms and footwear all were obviously well-fitted. This convinced me that the bodies were truly those of Polish officers. The degree of wear on the clothing and particularly the wear on the shoes led me to believe that these officers had been dead a long time, otherwise the shoes and clothing would show much more wear. This was the point that was not called to our attention by the Germans. It is one of the strongest arguments by which to fix the date of the killing.‚Äù [http://www.electronicmuseum.ca/Poland-WW2/katyn_memorial_wall/kmw_vanvliet.html]

===Seven officers of the German Wehrmacht===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;In November 1945, seven officers of the German Wehrmacht, K.H. Strueffling, H. Remlinger, E. B√∂hom, E. Sommerfeld, H. Jannike, E. Skotki and E. Geherer were tried by a court of the victorious allies: the Americans, the English, the French and the Soviets. They were condemned to death for their role in the Katyn massacre and were subsequently hanged. Three more were tried on the same charges; E.P. Vogel, F. Wiese, A. Diere. They received sentences of 20 years of hard labor, were turned over to the Soviets and never heard from again.[29]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Nuremberg Trials===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;In 1946, the chief Soviet prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials tried to indict Germany for the Katyn killings, stating that &quot;one of the most important criminal acts for which the major war criminals are responsible was the mass execution of Polish prisoners of war shot in the Katyn forest near Smolensk by the German fascist invaders&quot;,[30] but dropped the matter after the United States and the United Kingdom refused to support it and German lawyers mounted an embarrassing defense.[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate.'''

===What did Soviet scholars reveal in 1989===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;In 1989 Soviet scholars revealed that Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles[32], and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoje and Pyatikhatki.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate. '''

In 1989 Soviet scholar didn‚Äôt reveal anything of that kind. What they had found at the time were as follows:
# They found documents  evidenced that Polish officeres were sent to OSO of the NKVD  (osoboe soveshanie ‚Äì special council ). &lt;''OSO of the NKVD'' was a special non-judicial body with judicial powers&gt;.
# They found transport lists of Polish officeres.

From that info they drawed a conclusion that Polish officeres might be executed after formal trials in OSO. &lt;br&gt;

'''Not comprehensive'''

There should be mention that Mikhail Gorbachev admittion (April 13, 1990) was made during a hot ‚Äúanti-stalinism‚Äù campaign in Soviet media and when there were no any direct evidences (!) that murder was commited by Soviets and that the Soviet military prosecutor's office started to investigate the case AFTER (!) this admittion (September 27, 1990). And thus it was influenced by such admittion and the case became politically motivated. In USSR it was as a direct order in what direction should the case be investigated.

But they had a trouble very soon ‚Äì they found that OSO couldn‚Äôt send Poles to death because it had no such rights. The most hard punishment OSO could gave was 8 years of corrective labor with prohibition of correspondence.

===The sealed package no. 1===

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;After further evidence was discovered by Poles and Americans in 1991 and 1992, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin released and transferred to the new Polish president, former Solidarity leader Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa top-secret documents from the sealed package no. 1[38] [1].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''That‚Äôs factually inaccurate due to acausal connection. '''

What evidence was discovered by Poles and (!?-&gt;)Americans? Discovery of the Sealed package no.1 had the pure domestic reason. At that time in 1992  in the Consitution Court of Russia there was the trial over the banned Communist Party of the SU. And during this process the President side out of sudden showed the copies of the documents from the package no.1 that was just found. When defendants demanded a criminal expertise of the originals the President side refused to give them and in the final Court decision the Katyn case was not mentioned. 

And what is suspicious here is that they didn‚Äôt allow seeing originals for more than 10 years (while the criminal case #159 was in process).

::''The next major discovery turned up in an unexpected place--the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. While conducting research on Katyn at the Archives in spring 1990, a Polish-American art and antiques expert named Waclaw Godziemba-Maliszewski was given a copy of an article entitled &quot;The Katyn Enigma: New Evidence in a 40-Year Riddle&quot; that had appeared in the Spring 1981 issue of Studies in Intelligence. It was written by CIA officer and NPIC analyst Robert G. Poirier, who used imagery from Luftwaffe aerial photoreconnaissance during World War II to uncover evidence of the original crime and a Soviet coverup during 1943-1944. 16 The imagery, selected from 17 sorties flown between 1941 and 1944 and spanning a period before, during, and after the German occupation of the Smolensk area, was important evidence. Among other things, it showed that the area where the mass graves were located had not been altered during the German occupation and that the same area displayed physical changes that predated the Germans' arrival. It also captured the NKVD on film bulldozing some of the Polish graves and removing bodies. Poirier speculated that the corpses had been removed and reburied at another site.''
::''At the National Archives, Godziemba-Maliszewski located the same imagery that Poirier had used. He also found additional shots of Katyn and the other two execution sites at Mednoye and near Kharkov. He discovered much additional imagery, new collateral evidence, and eyewitness testimony, resulting in important new conclusions about what actually happened at Katyn.''
::''After completing further research, in January 1991 Godziemba-Maliszewski turned over copies of the imagery and Poirier's article to scientists at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. They in turn passed the information to the Polish Ministry of Justice. The Ministry had to be convinced that the article and photographic evidence were bona fide and that Godziemba-Maliszewski was not, as some suspected, a CIA agent! Stefan Sniezko, Poland's deputy general prosecutor, then gave an interview to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel [Daily Mirror], published on 12 May 1991. This was the first public disclosure of the Luftwaffe imagery and its utility for identifying burial sites in the USSR.''

Halibutt, I agree that this is related to the WW2. I simply objected to your making such absurd arguments that in the Soviet historiography it was somehow considered that &quot;the USSR did not take part in WWII at all.&quot; --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 19:47, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Katyn massacre happened precisely during WWII and because the USSR entered the war on September 17, 1939. Otherwise there would be no Allied POWs in Soviet captivity and there would be noone to murder (well, except for the Soviet citizens, but this is another story).&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Your statement contradicts to the article's very first line which reads &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Katyn (...) was a mass execution of Polish citizens by the Soviet Union (USSR) in the year before the USSR entered World War II. [1]&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Was the Soviet Union at war or not?? Resolving the reference [1] (which leads us to that CIA article), it reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Strictly speaking, even the Polish servicemen were not POWs. The USSR had not declared war, and the Polish commander in chief had ordered his troops not to engage Soviet forces.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/code&gt; That again contradicts to the numerous claims in the article that prisoners of war were killed. --[[User:Anti-Flag|Anti-Flag]] 19:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;

I'd say that SU had not entered the war in 1939, although it all depends on whether you agree that their 17th September invasion of Poland without declaration of war was an invasion or not. Nonetheless as it is obvious that Poland was a participant of the war and an Ally in 1939, it is also obvious that Katyn massacre was carried on Allied personel during the time Allies were involved in the IIWW. I honestly don't see a problem here: 'rules laywers' may try to argue that SU was not a part of the war till 1941, but there is no denying Poland was. What's more is there to say?--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 04:48, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:It doesn't really depend on what I agree with. No matter if I agree or not, the article contradicts itself. To avoid controversy, the term 'prisoner of war' should be generalized to 'prisoner'. --[[User:Anti-Flag|Anti-Flag]] 12:40, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

::Indeed, the article contradicts itself in whether the USSR was engaged in WWII at that point or not. However, the Poles in Soviet captivity were called prisoners of war by the Soviets themselves - most of the NKVD documents (including Beria's order of March 5) mention the term ''voyennoplennyie'' (prisoners of war), and not ''arestovanyie'' (arrested), ''zaklyuchenyie'' (incarcerated), ''plennyie'' (prisoners) or ''uzniki'' (inmates).

While so many questions are looming about the neutrality and factual accuracy, I don't think that keeping the FA tag is appropriate. The tag with the wording that this is &quot;one of the best articles produced by the WP community&quot; applied to the article with several clear questions about both neutrality and factual accuracy is harmful for the reputation of the FA tag as well as for WIkipedia as a whole. Once the issues are addressed, we can put it up for another FA vote if authors want that. It seems to me that the problems are so clear that no de-FA formal vote is necessary, especially since it is likely to rise same kinds of barbs and emotions that were present in the FAing vote.

Halibutt, the &quot;community&quot; was not unanimous and Raul made his own decision on whether the opposition is insignificant enough to declare consensus. I think that the talk above shows that the article clearly has problems with accuracy and neutrality. At least there are valid questions to both. This shows that the FA label was applied prematurely. I am not accusing Raul in taking sides here. I just suggest that FAing should be more a conservative process. Right now, several Poland related article that feature a FA tag raise some valid questions. This is not supposed to happen to FA's as this undermines the reputation of Wikipedia if even ''featured'' articles are validly disputed. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]]

:What can be seen above is a sensible and source-supported discussion on how to improve the article. The article is good even without it, which has been proved by the wiki community.

Of course we could wait another week or two, but would it change anything? I doubt it.

==Technicality==

In regards to the technicality that this most heinous and horrific crime should not be included in World War II Crimes, I completely understand the &quot;technicality&quot;. The fact of the matter is however, that when the Soviet Union inavaded Poland on September 17, 1939, in order to &quot;protect its minorities&quot;, it entered the Second World War, and all of the intellectual onanism that it did not, is just that. Katyn has always been referrenced to the Second World War because it is a part of it. Of course there are still those who deny that it happened, and who did it. Fortunately for these people the [[Stalin Society]] holds meetings for them to comfort and support each other. [[User:Dr. Dan|Dr. Dan]] 16:54, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

A couple of questions for the ephemeral and anonymous [[Futrzakus]]. Wasn't it the Soviet people, until relatively recently? But if you prefer russian people (sic), O.K., what were the Russian people doing in Poland on September 17, 1945? What were they doing in Finland later that year? What were they doing in the Baltic States in June 1940?

::It is a completely different massacre in a completely different place. There were rumors that the Communist ideologists deliberately choose to emphasize the plight of these particular village (among thousands destroyed by Nazi) since its name sounds very similar to Katyn and so can create confusion between the two massacres.

Here is the source:
https://www.cia.gov/csi/studies/winter99-00/art6.html
Then, in 1969, Moscow did something strange that many believe was further calculated to confuse the issue further: it chose a small village named Khatyn as the cite for Belorussia's national war memorial. There was no apparent reason for the selection. Khatyn was one of 9,200 Belorussian villages the Germans had destroyed and one of more than a hundred where they had killed civilians in retaliation for partisan attacks. In Latin transliteration, however, Katyn and Khatyn look and sound alike, though they are spelled and pronounced quite differently in Russian and Belorussian. When President Nixon visited the USSR in July 1974, he toured the Khatyn memorial at his hosts' insistence. Sensing that the Soviets were exploiting the visit for propaganda purposes, The New York Times headlined its coverage of the tour: &quot;Nixon Sees Khatyn, a Soviet Memorial, Not Katyn Forest.&quot; (The Times probably got it right. During the Vietnam war, the Soviets frequently took visiting US peace activists to Khatyn.)

== Quote from Polish Government ==

Please don't revert to the version that claims that the 'Departamental Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation' believes that all of those arrested were spies and saboteurs.  That is misleading.  The full sentence makes it clear that many were 'intelligence agents and gendarmes, spies and saboteurs, former landowners, factory owners and officials'.  See ref 6.  
'Spies and saboteurs' makes it sound like someone is trying to justify the massacre.

== The Nuremberg Trials (2) ==

I don't intend to do an in-depth review of this apparently highly controversial article. I'll just concentrate on the first paragraph of that section:

:''In November 1945, seven officers of the German Wehrmacht, [...] were tried by a court of the victorious allies: the Americans, the British, the French and the Soviets. They were falsely charged and condemned to death for their role in the Katyn massacre and were subsequently hanged. Three more were tried on the same charges; E.P. Vogel, F. Wiese, A. Diere. They received sentences of 20 years of hard labor, were turned over to the Soviets and never heard from again.''

The reference given for this is [http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/General/Katyn/KatynHanged.html]. First, Irving is not a credible reference, and the second link looks scarcely better. Secondly, [http://www.shoa.de/content/view/349/53/ Shoa.de] tells a different story: they seem to have the names correct, and they state it were not allied trials but Soviet ones. I don't know which version is true, but in its current form, this paragraph is inacceptable. In either case, it wasn't one of the Nuremberg Trials, neither the main trial nor one of the subsequent 12 U.S. trials. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 11:11, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

''Indeed, having retaken the Katyn area almost immediately after the Red Army had recaptured Smolensk, Soviet Union, led by the MKVD''

This was supposed to say NKVD I'm sure?

Paragraph 6 under the heading &quot;Revelations&quot; incorrectly cites (as #44) an articles from FrontPageMag.com as claiming Nazi responsibility for the Katsyn massacre.  I read this article - it is doing the very opposite, and reaffirming Soviet responsibility.  FrontPageMag is very conservative, so this is more in line with what you would expect.

I don't know how to do references (I'm very new at editing wiki), but citation 44 should be removed, and the rest of them bumped down one number.
:The magazine does not blame the Germans, but it mentions that Stalin and others did (''Stalin, naturally, blamed the massacre on the Nazis, and for fifty years the Soviets would steadfastly maintain their innocence.'').

==Number of officers killed==

According to Beria's note, there were 8,424 polish warrant officers, offisers and general officers in the soviet POW camps and prisons. About 300 of them were spared the execution. Which brings the total number of the officers executed to approximately 8000. Hence the correction [[User:Fat yankey|Fat yankey]] 17:34, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
:While I appreciate the attempt to clarify the numbers, I think that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Katyn_massacre&amp;diff=76620541&amp;oldid=75635370 the current version] may be misleading, as it suggests majority of the Polish army was composed of belarussians and ukrainians, which I don't think was the case. Soviets released Polish soldiers below the rank of NCOs, but they kept officers (the ~8,000) and NCOs (which I think compromise the ~25,000), and that the 25,000 represents all non-officer soldiers of Polish nationality.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|&amp;nbsp;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&amp;nbsp;]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 18:11, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
::Well, that's what russian documents say. By October 23, 1939 there were 85,074 polish POWs still in camps and at transfer points. 41,819 of them were from Western Poland, and had to be delivered to Germans. The 8,470 of the rest were officers and warrant officers (chorƒÖ≈ºy) to be delivered to Starobelsk and Kozelsk special camps, 4700 were police officers, etc., to be sent to Ostashkov camp, 18,000 NCO and privates were to be employed on roadworks (Rovno camp), and 10,000 NCO and privates were requested to work near Krivoj Rog (''–ö–∞—Ç—ã–Ω—å. –ü–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –Ω–µ–æ–±—ä—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã''. —Å–±.–¥–æ–∫. –ú., –ú–§ &quot;–î–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—è&quot;: 1999, —Å—Å.163-164). Out of the ~250,000 captured, about half were released by the army almost on the spot, and only 125,000 were delivered to NKVD. NKVD released 42,400 of them, 43,000 gave to Germans, and had the balance of 39,600 POWs by November 19, 1939. Of those, 8,500 were military officers and warrant officers, 6,500 were police officers, and 24,600 were NCOs and privates. (ibid., cc.208-210).[[User:Fat yankey|Fat yankey]] 19:25, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
:::All right.

::::Source states that, but in non-documentary part, which makes it a conclusion, not a fact. And there is no documental proof, that most of the released were indeed of ukrainian or belorussian origin. But there is documental proof, that such were intentions of the Soviet government. And then again, if about a quarter of the population of ''Rzeczpospolita'' were belorussians and ukrainians, it's just naturally to guess, that about a quarter of the army were of that origin too. Given, that the men strength of ''Wojsko Polskie'' was about 1 million people, the estimation of 150-200 thousand of belorussian and ukrainian soldiers in the Eastern Poland looks sound enough.[[User:Fat yankey|Fat yankey]] 21:44, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
:::::Good point, however the total numbers of Polish POWs was about 700,000 (see [[Invasion of Poland (1939)]] for details), out of which Soviet held ~250,000. Although assuming minorities had no reservations about joining Polish army (conscripts, seems logical) almost 1/3 of them would be non-Poles (as about 1/3 of SPR population were minorities), however Ukrainians and Belarusians would compromise only 17% of the total population (see [[Second_Polish_Republic#Minorities]] for details). This 17% of gives us closer to ~42,500. Thus if NKVD released ~125,000 out of their ~250,000, plus about 42,500 soon afterwards, thus assume in the ~167,500 released that way we have ~125,000 non-B. and non-U., thus not only did the NKVD release some Poles but I'd say that it's unlikely half of them were B. and U. (unless my math is wrong...?), and thus saying that majority of the released were B. and U. seems doubtful.

::::::Well, you assume uniform B&amp;U distribution among the units of the polish army, while I assume the concentration of B&amp;U in the units formed in the eastern Poland, which is more natural, and has some factual proof. But I never thought that there were such many jews in Poland. I knew, that ethnical minorities were about 30% of Rzeczpospolita's population, and assumed, that most of them were B&amp;U... Well, now I think it's better to change &quot;belorussian and ukrainian&quot; to &quot;non-polish&quot;.

==Cat:Genocide==
[[Genocide]] is an exptremly loaded word. The cat implies the applicability of it being universal or near-universal. There is no such thing here. The cat addition was not discussed either. I accept the need for the sourced discussion of the term's applicability with the reader left to decide but not the pre-judgement of such discussion by the –¥—â—Ñ–≤—É–≤ cat stamped over an entire article. This is a very serious matter and imporper cat of such strength as cat:Genocide warrants a global &quot;POV&quot; tag over the whole article.

:Piotrus, I thought you could do better than to bring frivolous arguments that refer to the Soviet propaganda attempt to reassign the responsibility for this event. I view such act as bad faith. I don't want to revert war with you but adding cat:Genocide is extremely serious and just cannot be done based on Soviet propaganda statements.

I find your view of Soviet propaganda interesting: it is ok when it suits your views (for example, claims Polish attrocities during PSW) but not ok when it condemns Soviet Union itself :( Soviet Union and Allies agreed that Katyn was a genocide during Nurember Trials. That Soviet Union - and Russia - later renouced that declaration when it became apparent that it, not Germany, committed the massacre does not change the fact that Nuremberg and most of the world consider it a genocide.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|&amp;nbsp;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&amp;nbsp;]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 03:52, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

Piotrus, Nuremberg judges specifically declined the Soviet request to opine on Katyn because they saw that the Soviet request was fishy from the onset.

As for your usage of Soviet propaganda, cursory glance at who uses [[Isaac Babel]] and [[Red Cavalry]] stories ([http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/995/konarmiya.html sic!]) as reference for the [[controversies of the Polish-Soviet War]] is enough, I believe, to show that you have not shied away from using such dubious sources in the past.--&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|&amp;nbsp;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&amp;nbsp;]]|[[User_talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 04:16, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

Piotrus, you said that I used [[Red Cavalry]]. This was a false statement and I called it as such. Now you try a second round. What do you mean I &quot;might have not used Red Stories directly&quot;. Whether I might have not or I did not is seen in the references list. Look, read... o-o-ops, I did not indeed. So, your statement was false. Even the source you claim states that the diary &quot;contrasts&quot; the propaganda. 1920 work is pro-neither. It is a documentary account of events. I am not using &quot;other works&quot;. He wrote his diary for himself and did not intend it to be published. You can read selected pages of the Diary in google books and good luck finding any propaganda there.

I agree with Halibutt here as far as the general approach is conserned. Moving stuff to subarticle may be warranted when the stuff is redundant but not to simply shorten the article that seems &quot;too long&quot;. Perhaps the subject is worthy. For instance, Piotrus lately moved stuff out of the [[Polish-Soviet War]] despite my fierce protests and now the material is staying on the backburner with no one caring. Another problem with such material removal is that the duplication creates separate articles evolving on their own creating extra work for editors and possibility of intra-wikipedia contradictions. Example of an acceptable spin-off is when the article contains a redundant section arbitrary pasted into it while its content should be integrated by being rearranged among the properly structured sections. But I don't see a case for that here now. The flow is chronological: prelude, events, post-events development (also in chronological order). No need to create subarticles as of now. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 09:46, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== confusion about the name Sikorski. ==

One of the generals that was killed was Franciszek Sikorski.
The head of the Polish government-in-exile was W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski.

Who is the general Sikorski that is discussed throughout?  At times it seems he was one of the perpetrators, as he is described as being used by the Germans as keeping the rift alive.  At other times he seems not.

Is W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski a general?  It's not stated.  If so, he could be the General Silorski.

===Questions===
While it is unquestionable that a few hundred polish nationals (up to 400) were executed for crimes against the Soviet state in Kharkov and Kalinin, other executions are a bit eerie. While the president of the Russian Federation admitted that the massacre was done by the NKVD, he is not a COURT to decide, and, to my knowledge, it was not yet solved in COURT. Thus, despite the evidence implicating that the massacre is a work of NKVD, it has not yet been made final. Also, there are interesting problems. For example, the article states that the poles were shot in the back of the head. My sources indicate same thing - 98.5% of the dead were shot in the back of the head, the rest - in the back of the neck. However, the poles executed in Kharkov and Kalinin show a different pattern - 60% are shot in the neck, with the rest getting shot in the back of the head. What is the difference between the two ways of execution? When shot in the head, it doesn't nessesarily mean instant death, but is simpler to do, while shooting in the back of the neck requires twisting the hand with the gun in such a way so that the bullet severs the nerves, causing instant death. Oh, and did I mention that the poles in Kharkov and Kalinin are shot with russian weapons, while it's widely known that the &quot;NKVD&quot; somehow used german weapons in Katyn. Also, supposedly exhumations turned up newspapers. I suggest all of you who believe that it is possible, to go get some newspaper, wrap them in cloth and bury them for a year. It is not gonna be readable.
Another thing - the documents this page gives as proof seem fake. I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but something is out of place in them. However, it is too early to say they are fake.
So supposedly the documents show Soviet motivation (although it goes much against Soviet legal practice, and is much more befitting the Germans); so, could Germany have a motivation to blame Katyn on USSR? Certainly. Could the Polish government have a motive to blame Soviets over Germans? Certainly - after all, this government in exile was at war with the USSR, and it had to be justified to the Western Allies. Did the late government of the USSR have a motive to lie? Certainly - they were traitors/fools after all. To summarize - this is still quite a controversial topic. With respect, [[User:Ko Soi IX|Ko Soi IX]] 22:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

===Answers===
It's unbelievable someone still tries to deny that USSR is responsible for the massacre.
first of all, [[User:Ko Soi IX|Ko Soi IX]] these few hundreds executed in Kharkov and Kalinin haven't committed any crime: they were fighting against soviet invasion.
NKVD has used German guns because soviet ones were getting overheated after some time. Do not forget, on corpses in Katyn have been found injuries made with soviet bayonets.
I am not going to comment your theory concerning faking documents, I don't have any knowledge about how paper behaves in soil.
When the graves were discovered Polish government was not in state of war wits USSR: see [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]]. Only when Poles had asked the Red Cross to investigate the case, Soviets accused Poles of supporting Nazis and created &quot;Polish communistic government&quot;. It was very beneficial for Soviets: they had a pretext to occupy Poland and incorporate it's eastern part into USSR.
Finally, it has been solved in court: 1946 {{Nuremberg Trials}}: Soviets accused some Germans of Katyn, but the Germans were found innocent. So, if no Germans then who?
I hope I've clarified the whole thing. Anyway, it was a strange experience: like explaining someone that the Nazi concentration camps were created by Nazis, not by Soviets.

== Verification of Bodies ==

== Info about estimates is completely wrong ==

&quot;Estimates of the number of Polish citizens executed at three mass-murder sites in the spring of 1940 range from 1,803[2] and 14,540[3][4] to 21,857[1] and over 28,000 on the high end.[&quot;

1803 is not an estimate but a sum of all bodies exhumed by Soviet and Russian authorities, which is a minimum number of the Poles &quot;established&quot; to have been killed (basically, a technicality).

28,000 is not an estimate AT ALL.

21,857 does not pertain to THREE places of execution.

The Russian government has agreed to allow the Polish authorities to examine Soviet archives on what Poles call the Katyn Forest massacre of 1940. 
More than 20,000 Polish soldiers were killed by the Soviet secret police at the start of World War II.

== Grammar so poor there is no adjective for it ==

It will also consider as authentic proofs the documents and official reports of the United Nations governments, including those drawn up by the commissions established in the various Allied countries, for the investigations into the war crimes as well as the official reports of the hearings and the decisions of the military courts or other courts of any of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; and coded as URSS-54. The German White Book of 1943 was accepted on grounds of the article 19&lt;ref&gt;Article 19: The Court will not be bound by the technical rules related to the management of the evidence. It will adopt and apply as much as possible an expeditious and nonformal procedure, and will admit any means which it estimates of a convincing value.&lt;/ref&gt;with, as had underlined it the president of the court,&lt;ref&gt;''Proc√®s des grands criminels de guerre devant le Tribunal Militaire International de Nuremberg'', Tristan Mage, 1993-98, XVII, p.277-380 for the two sessions consecrated to the Katyn masacre&lt;/ref&gt; a ''potential'' convincing value; the course of the debates would make this adjective pointless. The intransigence of the Soviets to reveal Katyn in the bill of indictment was driven by the final objective: to quote it in the verdict. To this end, summoning of some witnesses was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Three German officers present in 1943 were accepted by the court (on six asked by defense), while prof. Neville, teaching the forensic medicine in Geneva and member of the International Commission of 1943 have been refused. The charge correlatively obtained the presentation of three witnesses, inclyding prof. Markov, Bulgarian and member of this same commission, &quot;pesuaded&quot; by the Soviets with the known means of pressure, as well as the president of the Soviet Commission, Burdenko, which was also the president of the medical Academy of Science of the USSR.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

I omitted the above section of the &quot;Soviet-run Trials&quot; section because only two of the references it cites actually point to researchable texts and the grammar and writing style is horrendous to a point that I can do nothing about it; I simply do not know what the author of the paragraph is trying to say.

I don't see how this article is anti-russian at all. Seeing as their government has admitted that its own forces carried out this massacre, the only real debate is whether this qualifies as a genocide or not, and I believe that the article does touch on both sides of that debate. There is no way of sugarcoating an event like this, the systematic, high-level murder of 25,000 unarmed and defenceless people is a ghastly crime that is bound to provoke revulse, and though most rational thinking people will not associate the modern russian government with this crime, it is evidently still a very sensitive issue. Personally I think it should just be accepted as a genocide and let the world move on. When there is a wealth of evidence against Russia, an admittance of guilt, and very little apart from crazy conspiracy theories with no factual evidence about falsified papers, it is very hard to represent a pro russian view, personally I think the article is perfectly fair.

Rather than talking of the opinion of &quot;the Russians&quot;, it would be wiser to remember that the leadership of the U.S.S.R. came from several nationalities and adjust this and similar articles accordingly; nor did they discriminate among those they murdered. The fact that there were a disproportionate number of Georgians among them did not spare Georgians from their murderous policies. That said, I'd be very interested to read any point of view that tried to claim Katyn was anything but mass-murder.[[Special:Contributions/86.170.77.152|86.170.77.152]] ([[User talk:86.170.77.152|talk]]) 16:57, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Estimates&quot; ==

The text says now that the &quot;estimates of the number of dead range from 15,000[2][3] to 21,768.[4]&quot;. This is very misleading.

First of all we must decide whether we care about all estimates or only about the credible ones. As an analogy, one can point to the Nazi camps Majdanek and Auschwitz. Many estimates were made throughout the decades, most of them clearly erroneous. Thus, for a long time an estimate of 4,000,000 victims in Auschwitz was rather widespread (especially through the Soviet-dominated Europe - but not exclusively). So it is for Majdanek, where there was an estimate of 1.5 million victims (contrast this with the current estimate of 78,000 victims). Then there are deniers' &quot;estimates&quot;...

Thus, one could write something like &quot;estimates of the number of dead in Auschwitz range from 70,000 to 4,000,000&quot;, and that would be true in a sense that there are such estimates. But this would mislead the reader unnecessarily.

Now, there is no controversy about the number of the victims of Katyn massacre (when the term is used in the extended fashion, to denote all the victims murdered according to the 5.3.1940 order). It is about 22,000, take or add a thousand.

Now, when dilettantes write about the Katyn massacre, they often have in mind numbers like &quot;14,000&quot; or &quot;15,000&quot;. But those denote only the number of Polish victims from the three camps. They ignore about 7000 or so victims from the prisons. So one cannot really compare the numbers like 15,000 and 22,000, saying that they're just &quot;estimates&quot;. It's apples and oranges - 15,000 is for the victims from the three camps, 22,000 is for the victims from the three camps AND from an unknown number of prisons.

So I will edit this portion accordingly.--[[User:Sergey Romanov|Sergey Romanov]] ([[User talk:Sergey Romanov|talk]]) 12:28, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== Trials, etc. ==

I have heavily amended the Leningrad trial section, which was basically full of misinformation and was relying on Holocaust &quot;revisionist&quot; sources. I have used the book &quot;Katynskij sindrom&quot;, written by two Russian Katyn historians and a former head of the Military Prosecutor's Office Katyn team who have actually examined the Leningrad trial record.

Also, putting Nuremberg part in &quot;Soviet-run trials&quot; section is weird, isn't it? Thus, renamed. The Savenkov part was also flawed.

== Duere/Diere/D√ºrer ==

JFYI, in Poland there is a book by almost the same authors:

http://biblionetka.pl/ks.asp?id=58705

I've been told it's more or less the same as Katynskij sindrom, so Polish colleagues can try to check Diere info in it. 

And one more thing: I spell it &quot;Diere&quot; because it's been so spelled in contemporary English-language news items posted at Axishistory Forum, the authors actually spell it &quot;Duere&quot; (but still not &quot;Duerer&quot;, as in one of Axishistory pages).

However, I see that A.V.Prusin in Holocaust and Genocide Studies [http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/1/1.pdf] also calls him &quot;Duere&quot; (if you can't access the page, you can google for &quot;arno duere&quot; and its cache will be one of the search results), so perhaps this is the spelling we should use after all.

Prusin's sources for the name appear (note 74, p. 28) to have been Russian newspaper reports; might the correct spelling have been lost in transliteration from cyrillic?

== Nuremberg Trials ==

I run into the pararagraph, which indirectly indicates Nuremberg trials insisted on blaming the Germans on Katyn massacre (I didn't know that):

&quot;The investigations that indicted the German state rather than the Soviet state for the killings are sometimes used to impeach the Nuremberg Trials in their entirety, often in support of Holocaust denial, or to question the legitimacy and/or wisdom of using the criminal law to prohibit Holocaust denial. Still, there are some who deny Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, and try to prove that Poles were shot by Germans in 1941.&quot;

It should simply say directly what it implies and naturally it does diminish the creditability of Nuremberg trials a bit. I don't see any reason for saying this could be considered a part of Holocaust implying, that taking blame off Germans is a crime true or not!

&quot;After the war the Nuremberg trial investigations falsely indicted the German state for Katyn massacres. Also today some deny all Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, and try to prove that Poles were shot by Germans in 1941.&quot;  &lt;small&gt;‚ÄîPreceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Finlander|Finlander]] ([[User talk:Finlander|talk]] ‚Ä¢ [[Special:Contributions/Finlander|contribs]]) 16:33, 7 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Fringe speculations do not belong in an encyclopedia ==

In a long forgotten, 2 page opinion piece in a 1981 edition of ''Commentary'' magazine, English professor George Watson ''speculated'' (rather than &quot;concluded&quot;, as editors keep insisting here) that &quot;Katyn may have been discussed&quot; in the April 1940 meeting. There are exactly zero reliable sources supporting this speculation. In a response to a critical letter to the editor, Watson went out of his way to point out he was merely speculating. This totally fringe theory, by a Fellow in English (not a historian) does not belong in an encyclopedia. Likewise, the source being used, a master's thesis by a Louis Robert Coatney a [http://lcoat.tripod.com/1albegtx.txt '''board game developer'''], is hardly a reliable source.

That's all he says about the meeting; he also discussed what he says are similarities in Nazi and soviet murder techniques, towards a different part of his speculation (the Nazis learned their techniques from the Soviets, another view with no academic/scholarly support).

[[WP:RS]] applies to sources and [[flickr.com]] is not a source, it is a photo collection site; the source is a flickr user, wallyg.  I am making the editorial judgment that the link to this photograph meets the [[WP:EL]] criteria and since I myself have seen the monument, the photo satisfies any [[WP:V]] challenges, of the form:
* The Jersey City Katyn Massacre Monument does not exist.
* The Jersey City Katyn Massacre Monument does exist, but wallyg's photograph does not accurately depict it.

== The &quot;the Nazis did it in 1943, not the Soviets in 1940&quot; view ==

The Katyn story is of course of immense and lasting interest, not only for its incomprehensible body count, but for the understanding and interpretation of WW2, the Soviet Union, the German war story, etc. etc. We ought not to be surprised that there are conflicting views. I do think the current version of the article is quite fine and represents the consensus view rather well. Nevertheless there are &quot;Soviet apologists&quot; and I suppose a small minority of historians still eager to demonstrate that somehow the NKVD could not have done what most of us believe they did. I've decided to add just one more link to the article, under &quot;External Links&quot;, of this sort, to represent the &quot;the Nazis did it in 1943, not the Soviets in 1940&quot; view; this is Ella Rule's 2002 article, which I found at The Stalin Society. I wish us to include this link, not because I believe in its truth, but because I judge it better to have these arguments in the open. Two lines on this could also be operated into the main text of the Katyn article. [[User:Slavatrudu|Slavatrudu]] ([[User talk:Slavatrudu|talk]]) 09:15, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

Robert's book(Yale University press)(2003): In the footnote (n.29, p. 400) Roberts records Harriman's summarizing his daughter's conclusion that &quot;from the general evidence and the testimony Kathleen and the Embassy staff member believe that in all probability the massacre was perpetrated by the Germans.&quot;

In the TEXT (pp. 171-2) there's a much longer quotation from Kathleen Harriman.

First, she remarks on how &quot;fresh&quot; the bodies looked. This was a big issue with Burdenko. The Germans said the Soviets had shot the Polish officers in the Spring of 1940, which would have meant they'd have been in the ground during three whole summers, when the earth is warm and decomposition would be rapid.

The Soviets contended that the Germans had shot the Poles in the Fall of 1941, so they'd have been in the ground during only two summers (1942 and 1943). Logically, therefore, better preserved bodies would point towards German guilt.

Goebel's diary might not be new, but if Goebbels admits to the crime...

Supposedly they were &quot;discovered&quot; in 1989. But Gorbachev denies having seen them, or knowing about them at all, at all until December 23, 1991, two days before he left office. (On these points see New York Times articles of October 15, 1992, p. A1 and October 16, 1992, p.A6, available from the Historical New York Times database).

:::In my experience in dealing with editors who present a... dissenting point of view, demanding exact references to reliable sources usually does the trick better than declaring their ideas nonsense. This way, they do an excellent job discrediting themselves by either posting links to works of conspiracy theorists or, as is the case here, failing to produce a single piece of evidence supporting the acceptance of this view in academic sources. As you can see, the sources produced by Spastas actually directly contradict his view (those that are not outdated). I wonder why did he list sources like Fischer at all. I suspect, the quote of Goebbels' Spastas refers to is [[Katyn massacre#Soviet actions|this one]] (first quote).

== 21,857 vs. 21,768 ==

Why is the latter considered the &quot;most commonly cited number&quot; and not the former? I've seen 21,857 cited more often by historians and experts on the subject.

Example:

&quot;He (Wheatcroft) is right in saying that only 21,857 of the 25,700 ordered to be shot by the Politburo seem actually to have been `executed‚Äô&quot; - Robert Conquest

== Does the term Katyn Massacre apply to lots of massacres in different places far from Katyn? ==

The article is advancing the POV that the term Katyn massacre also applies to murders of  prisoners in various locations some far from Katyn:
:&quot;It now is applied to the simultaneous executions of prisoners of war from geographically distant Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps,[9] and the executions of political prisoners from West Belarus and West Ukraine,[10] shot on Stalin's orders at Katyn Forest, at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, at a Smolensk slaughterhouse, and at prisons in Kalinin (Tver), Kharkov, Moscow, and other Soviet cities.&quot;
The citations for this contention seem to be citations that various murders happened. It is of course possible that some people from the west who are unfamiliar with Eastern European geography have muddled the various locations, but that does not justify the assertion.
-[[User:Toddy1|Toddy1]] ([[User talk:Toddy1|talk]]) 22:15, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

This isn't POV - it's directly from the source. Originally the one in Katyn was the only one, or the main one, known about. Later it turned out that there were several coordinated massacres in several places. But the various massacres are still often collectively referred to as &quot;the Katyn massacre&quot; - as it states in the sources. This is also explained in the text.[[User:Radeksz|radek]] ([[User talk:Radeksz|talk]]) 22:17, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

*Citation 4 - Polish Government Decision to commence investigation into Katyn Massacre - this does not actually say that the various mass murders during &quot;the period between 5 March and an unspecified date in 1940 in Moscow, Kharkov, Smolensk, Katyn, Kalinin (now Tver), and other locations on the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; are known as the Katyn Massacre - the title of the documents are &quot;Decision to commence investigation into Katyn Massacre&quot; - but that is merely a snappy title mentioning the most famous of the murders.  There are references to so-called Katyn lists - that refer to lists of prisoners murdered or to be murdered in Belarus and Western Ukraine, though no references so-called Katyn lists referring to lists of the many prisoners murdered in Eastern Ukraine (e.g. Kharkov)
*Citation 9 - IN THE FOREST The Story of the Katyn Forest Massacre by J. K. ZAWODNY UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME PRESS ‚Ä¢ 1962 is a 235 page book.
*Citation 10 - Excerpt from the minutes No. 13 of the Politburo of the Central Committee meeting, shooting order of 5 March 1940 - this is a source for what happened, not for the allegation that murders in, for example, Kharkov are known as the Katyn Massacre
*Citation 11 - a page from the British state TV organisation - this says &quot;The massacre - in Katyn Forest near the Russian city of Smolensk - happened while the Poles were held prisoner... The Nazis discovered the bodies of several thousand Polish officers at Katyn in 1943, but Moscow did not admit responsibility for the killings until 1989.&quot;  It does not claim that the murders in Kharkov are known as the Katyn massacre.

There does seem to be a serious problem with this article: at various places, including the introduction, it seems to muddle the distinction between the total number of people killed during the Stalinist occupation (around 22 000?) and the total number of people (mainly NCOs, plus many officers) buried in Katyn forest (about an order of magnitude less, to judge from figures provided by the article). The fact that Katyn has become emblematic in Polish public consciousness (and elsewhere) does not excuse this ambiguity. Until it is cleared, the article is seriously flawed. [[User:Feketekave|Feketekave]] ([[User talk:Feketekave|talk]]) 19:26, 1 January 2010 (UTC)
:The 21,768 were all PoWs, executed in several prisons and prison camps simultaneously, by the same order (pictured).

I should have made clear that what I had in mind by &quot;people killed during the Stalinist occupation&quot; I meant people executed by Stalin's apparatus, rather than people who are stated as having perished after being deported. We need precise statistics on who died where, and possibly a change of title. A massacre is generally understood to mean an incident of slaughter, not the result of a country-wide policy. [[User:Feketekave|Feketekave]] ([[User talk:Feketekave|talk]]) 20:51, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

The 21,768 can't have been all PoWs, according to the page itself as it currently stands: &quot;About 8,000 were officers taken prisoner during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, the rest being Poles arrested for allegedly being &quot;intelligence agents, gendarmes, saboteurs, landowners, factory owners, lawyers, priests, and officials.&quot;[4]&quot; (Aside: not to be pedantic, but, since the article is for an English-speaking audience, we should make a distinction between officers and NCOs (blurred in this sentence).)[[User:Feketekave|Feketekave]] ([[User talk:Feketekave|talk]]) 20:55, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

The most exact numbers available are those from Shelepin's memo (first para in the &quot;Executions&quot; section). Still, that resolution regarded these PoWs and civilian prisoners specifically (NCOs were [[:File:1940-03-05_beria2.png|apparently excluded]]), so I'm not sure what you mean to accomplish in dividing the victims of the same order. --[[User:Illythr|Illythr]] ([[User talk:Illythr|talk]]) 15:54, 2 January 2010 (UTC)

:Don't confuse [[wikt:execution]] with [[capital punishment]] - the former is used in the article only in its 3rd sense - &quot;The act of putting to death or being put to death as a penalty, or actions so associated.&quot; and is there to avoid the overuse of &quot;killings&quot;, &quot;murders&quot; and &quot;massacre&quot; in the article, which are synonymous in this context. --[[User:Illythr|Illythr]] ([[User talk:Illythr|talk]]) 03:22, 12 April 2010 (UTC)

What followed are rather &quot;unrevealing&quot; things such as political statements, complaints, fruitless court suits and so on, so I moved them to the &quot;recent developments&quot; section, which, as I see it, is meant for such things.

== Is it not Genocide rather than Massacre ==

I would like other members to consider well the title of this article.  I have not edited any wikipedia articles before and do not wish to go in boldly and change things myself immediately - so I will wait for comments and then edit this.

The word and definition of [[genocide]] is clearly known since it was brought into use by the U.N..

What happened in 1940 was the killing of a very precisely defined group of people.  They were Polish officers and intellectuals.  Not only defined by nationality (as in the [[Armenian Genocide]] for example) but also by their social class.

Let us assume for a minute that 'who' killed these 22'000 men is a separate issue.  It follows that whether any court has found any person or group guilty of this genocide is irrelevant.  

When murder has clearly been committed - the police will declare it as murder regardless of whether anyone is found guilty of the crime.  

'''1.''' Over 22'000 Polish men are found shot in the back of the head buried in a number of forests in an area of the old USSR.
--&gt; We agree that they have all been murdered.  

'''2.''' They are all of the same nationality and most of the same social class.
--&gt; By the definition of the U.N. the above crime is defined as genocide.&lt;br /&gt;See [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].

'''3.''' The collection of [[genocide definitions|varying definitions among genocide scholars]] can be compared to the simple facts documented in this article.
--&gt; The deliberate nature of the Katyn killings in 1940 and clearly defined '''group''' being killed indicates that by wikipedia's standards at least this is Genocide.

I would be grateful to have this questioned as fully as possible.

== Katyn massacre or Katyn Massacre? ==

Hiya to all.  
A question on the titling, as this article came up in a discussion about use of capitals in article naming on [[Talk:Denial of the Armenian Genocide#Requested move]]; specifically and NARROWLY PLEASE, about the capitalization of titles of events like these.  Is Katyn massacre a proper noun, and if so, shouldn't it be Katyn Massacre? 
Here's my sense of it, copied from over there at the RfM, [where the proposal (not mine, I had questions that led to you) was to move the page from [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide]] to [[Armenian Genocide denial]]]:
This was my first question, because I thought, &quot;Well, this would conform better to the Manual of Style (which does not cover this specific point...YET):
*&quot;However, should it not be [[Armenian genocide denial]], unless there is some legitimate reason why in this case genocide should be capitalized?  Further, why should not (for examples) the articles [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Assyrian Genocide]], [[Srebrenica Genocide]], [[Rwandan Genocide]] follow the same naming conventions as do [[Greek genocide]], [[Dersim genocide]], and [[Burundi genocide]]?  I have the same question concerning titles containing the word massacre: Why [[Parsley Massacre]] but [[Rohingya massacre]]?  Perhaps if such topics are considered events and as such are considered proper nouns...but I'd like to see all such titles conform across the board, to a coherently stated convention, whichever convention is supported by either clear policy or robust consensus.  I haven't looked hard for it at all, but maybe someone else has: Is there any established WP policy, guideline, or village pump decision on precisely this?&quot;
:The response was:
*&quot;I'll explain my vision. In the titles it is a name of an event (&quot;Greek Genocide&quot;), a term and not word-combination (adjective + noun) to mark the belonging of the event. The same way the terms for [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] or [[Caribbean Crisis]] and not [[Caribbean crisis]] with Caribbean as an adjective and crisis as a noun. Or the [[Berlin Blockade]], for another example.&quot;
:to which I queried further:
*&quot;Is your vision... supported by a WP policy, and if so, please point me to that policy.  I studied [[WP:Article titles]] and [[WP:Naming conventions#Capitalization]] to no avail.  Where is this 'an event, or series of events, is a proper noun whose terms shall be capitalized' policy, if there is one?  Declaring that something is an Event (not to opine in any way that this E/event isn't one) and thus is a proper noun that should be capitalized, could be controversial to some, and might encompass different scopes for different folks, so please explain also, if you can, why (as examples--there are a vast number of 'E/events' that might have this issue) the E/events currently titled (and capitalized like this--&gt;) [[Greek genocide]], [[Dersim genocide]], [[Burundi genocide]], and [[Rohingya massacre]] should not be capitalized as you propose for the move to [[Armenian Genocide denial]], if there is a good reason to handle each differently. Staying arbitrarily within the narrow category of death and dying-themed events only, why [[Moors murders]] and [[Soham murders]], but [[Parker-Hulme Murder]]?  (the current examples suggest, somewhat irregularly, that single death is an Event, but multiple death is an event, unless it's a whole lot of death, in which case it's an Event??)  What is the WP policy, if there is one, that sets these sorts of boundaries (or not) for E/events of all flavors?&quot;
:and got this answer:
*&quot;I do think that massacres or genocides you noted above should be capitallised. Those are events. A murder is an event, a pogrom is an event, a mass murder (massacre) is an event, a genocide is an event, but an article &quot;Mass murders&quot; is not an event, an article &quot;The genocides of Europe&quot; is not AN event or [[Sexual disorder]] is a collective word-combination and a collective article but [[Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder]] is a name of one disorder. the same way [[Greek Genocide|Greek]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] or Armenian Genocides are separate events and not some variety of genocides or something. I don't even thing this was ever discussed. Just all the [[WP:RS]]s write it with a capital letter so no doubts.&quot;
:Please share your thoughts on the idea of changing the name of this page to Katyn Massacre, a proper noun.  I'm going to try to edit the Manual of Style to address this question, and before I do, I'd like to find out what community consensus is on the matter.

This is inaccurate, as the text in the image does not make any mention of execution- it describes the &quot;Former polish military officers, policemen, and intelligence personnel&quot; in NKVD POW camps as people &quot;sworn to hatred of the Soviet system&quot; who are &quot;waiting for liberation only to actively join in the battle against the soviet state&quot;. Either the image should be changed to the page of the memo which orders the execution, or the caption should be changed to actually describe what is in the image.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚ÄîPreceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.76.121.91|91.76.121.91]] ([[User talk:91.76.121.91|talk]]) 14:18, 18 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The question of motive is not addressed in the article. The article on [[Stalin#Role_in_the_Polish-Soviet_War.2C_1919.E2.80.931921|Stalin]] suggests that Stalin had a personal motive for liquidating the Polish officers, because of his frustration when commanding the southern sector of the Polish front during the Polish-Soviet War, and the perception that Stalin caused the disastrous failure of this campaign in 1920. If these claims are accepted as reliable then they might be worth including here. [[User:Spike.robinson|Spike]] ([[User talk:Spike.robinson|talk]]) 10:15, 29 November 2010 (UTC)

== Fringe claim: Germans knew about the massacre beforehand? ==

I removed the following fringe claim. The source is not linked and thus hard to verify. I am not sure where to even add it if we wanted to keep it.

Writing in the ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine in 1981, George Watson, a Fellow in English at St. John's College, Cambridge suggested that the fate of Polish prisoners may have been discussed at the [[Gestapo‚ÄìNKVD Conferences|April 1940 conference]].&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Watson. &quot;Rehearsal for the Holocaust?&quot; ''Commentary'', 71 (June 1981), 60‚Äì61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* George Watson is generally unreliable for these claims.  George Watson is a literary historian and is working outside of his field.  Two page articles are rarely of significance in the humanities.  ''Commentary'' is a magazine of opinion with a political agenda (nothing wrong there); but Watson lacks the expertise to comment on these issues, and is publishing outside of the mode for this work.  Moreover, Watson has published poison pen books regarding Central European History in the past.  Good removal.  If the concept is addressed elsewhere, it may be valid to include.  But it sounds like a FRINGE theory by a non-expert deliberately publishing a short piece in a non-scholarly opinion magazine with a political bias.

== Not all officers in the camps were killed ==

Polish Wikipedia mentions that a number of officers were spared by the Soviets.

It includes Polish officers who declared willingness to cooperate with Soviet Union in case of war with Nazi Germany, those who declared that they were communists, and officers listed by Italy, Germany and Lithuania.
Interestingly the Polish group was divided into two camps, one led by Zygmunt Berling who while declaring loyalty to Polish Government in Exile wanted to work with Soviets, and lieutenant M.Morawski who according to the text believed  Soviet Union of European States will be formed after the war.

Also, the citation has not been hard-coded in, so no one can verify if the Polish article even makes such a claim.

The basic idea here is to separate the big 1990-2004 investigation with all its fact-finding work, from the subsequent action that focused on the post-1990 events instead of the 1940 ones. I made the header plural because I assume the INR's actions also count (as soon as someone actually writes what they did on Katyn).

== The Roosevelt Myth ==

I would like to add a section from the book The Roosevelt Myth by John Flynn. The two points I want to add to the article is that 1. President Roosevelt visited Stalin, even AFTER it was known of his atrocities in Ukraine, and still said nothing about Stalins claim to fame about having ownership of Poland and Baltic States, and 2. That after the war, he did NOTHING to change this view! Also I would like to add to this section, Americas view at the time on race and its anti-immigration policy towards Poland and what America thought of the Polish people. And I would like to add conspiracies about HAARP and the Polish plane crash.

I would like to add these changes:

The changes:

a) improve the chronological order of some sections;

b) clarify the reason for Red Cross' refusal to conduct the investigation in German-occupied territory;

c) point that the topic is controversial and that there are still authors, journalists and political figures who maintain that the execution of the Polish POWs was not perpetrated by the NKVD.

@Piotrus - My change included three parts... interestingly only the denial part caught your attention? If you do not have comments regarding the other proposed changes, then I take it, it would be ok to add these?

Regarding the ‚Äúdenial‚Äù: yes the book and movie I mention are probably a good example of a Fringe Theory. 

However, '''Fringe Theories are not forbidden to appear in Wikipedia articles'''. 

According to the link you cited above: &lt;cite&gt;&quot;A Wikipedia article should not make a fringe theory appear more notable than it is... [it] must not be given undue weight...&quot;&lt;/cite&gt;. Nothing in that guideline says that Fringe theories CAN NOT appear in an article. It just states that they need to be clearly identified as being &quot;not broadly supported&quot;.

My addition fits this guideline. It '''does not in any way attempt to argue with the official view''' on the subject, just points that there is a different point of view among certain circles. The two sentences (literally - two!) I wanted to add about the denial proponents '''can not possibly give this theory undue weight''', given the volume of this article. 

Piotrus, Katyn may be a highly sensitive and politicized topic. But wikipedia does not need to be... so please, let's not go into a &quot;double denial&quot; here - it is a fact that some writers disagree with the mainstream view and they have attempted to defend their point of view, to provide some facts and documents and to explain why they disagree. 

This information is relevant, it does not contradict with the WP guidelines and it could be interesting for the impartial and unbiased reader of this article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aenchevich|Aenchevich]] ([[User talk:Aenchevich|talk]] ‚Ä¢ [[Special:Contributions/Aenchevich|contribs]]) 23:32, 30 May 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Elaboration on motivation? ==

It is still confusing to me what the Soviet's motive for this massacre was and I hope someone can elaborate on this section. Germany invades Poland and so the Soviets kill Polish soldiers? Why the Polish officers and not fight the Germans who invaded territory that they believed was &quot;theirs&quot;? I know that Talk pages are not for debate about content but after reading this entire entry, I find it is still deficient in positing a cause for why this was done, or why Polish officers, journalists and doctors were even abducted. Even just an additional sentence or two would help. [[Special:Contributions/69.125.134.86|69.125.134.86]] ([[User talk:69.125.134.86|talk]]) 19:55, 6 July 2013 (UTC)
: As of spring 1940 the Polish state ceased to exist, its territories divided between Germany and USSR, who were happy to keep it that way. Those who willing to do everything in their power to bring it back were thus a liability to both sides. This was the Beria way of getting rid of that liability. The article already explains this in the second half of the Background section.--[[User:Illythr|illythr]] ([[User talk:Illythr|talk]]) 00:06, 7 July 2013 (UTC)
::Yeah I mean it's pretty clear - the Soviets would've been overjoyed at having the chance to wipe out half of Poland's most elite cadre of citizens in a single, horrendous, industrious period of slaughter. Once done, the threat of revived Polish nationalism, let alone an actual military, political or even economic threat from the former Polish state, became much diminished for a generation-plus.

:::Incidentally, you say &quot;I know that talk pages are not for debate about content&quot;. Well, yes they are. What else are they for? [[User:Britmax|Britmax]] ([[User talk:Britmax|talk]]) 08:03, 5 August 2013 (UTC)

Right, [[User:Britmax|Britmax]]. While it's clearly stated that talk pages are ''not a forum for general discussion of the article's subject'', they are absolutely for discussing the article (while of course being [[Wikipedia:Civility|polite]] and [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|welcoming]]!), which would include &quot;debating&quot; content if it was unclear, disputed, etc. Maybe [[Special:Contributions/69.125.134.86|69.125.134.86]] felt unsure of himself and so compelled to issue that disclaimer. Anyway, I think it's clear at this point what the motivation of the Soviets was, based on this excerpt from the article:

''The reason for the massacre, according to historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]], was that Stalin wanted to deprive a potential future Polish military of a large portion of its talent:''&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;...[the massacre] should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border. Since he intended to keep the eastern portion of the country in any case, Stalin could be certain that any revived Poland would be unfriendly. Under those circumstances, depriving it of a large proportion of its military and technical elite would make it weaker&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''In addition, Soviets realized that the prisoners constituted a large body of trained and motivated Poles who would not accept a [[Fourth Partition of Poland]].''
 
At least it seems clear to me. Cheers. '''&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:7px 7px 8px  #B8B8B8;&quot;&gt;[[User:Azx2|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#F50&quot;&gt;Az&lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:Azx2|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#600&quot;&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;color:#000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;''' 22:22, 5 August 2013 (UTC)
: ''[http://ipn.gov.pl/en/news/2006/decision-to-commence-investigation-into-katyn-massacre The chief motive for this criminal proposal was a realisation that the prisoners expected liberation in order to join the struggle against Soviet authority.]'' - perhaps this central point should be more emphasized in the article, instead of Weinberg's opinion. --[[User:Illythr|illythr]] ([[User talk:Illythr|talk]]) 23:37, 5 August 2013 (UTC)

I would say your contemplation on the motivation of soviets are based to anti-soviet propaganda. You can not prove these statements. They are only your imagination. 
Also, the document in note d. seems to be falsified.

# USSR have a much cleaner record in the case of human rights than even US, UK etc let alone Nazis. For instance, USSR relinquished their control over the 'colonies' after the October revolution whereas savage imperialist nations continued to held many nations as their colonies and looted them endlessly, treated the natives of these places as slaves and killed them mercilessly (The US backed coups in Indonesia, Chile etc killed many millions of communists. In the last decade of 19th century alone Britain has caused deaths of many many millions of Indians through famines that are caused by dumping of machine made goods that led to de-industrialisation and unemployment). The working hours being just 6 per day, giving away land, houses etc to people and so on would further prove this.
# The article is written in an assertive and biased manner.  Nowhere you can see an unbiased stance. No &quot;allegedly&quot; or anything.

It concluded that the NKVD did it, and, thanks to the declassified evidence, was able to discover the other execution sites at Mednoye and Pyatikhatki (which the Germans did not know about). The results of this investigation form the basis of all modern Katyn-related historical research. To use your wording, it is the world's historians who &quot;buy&quot; that Stalin did it.

== Merger proposal ==
{{Archive top|result=Since this thread has been open for more than 30 days and a request has been made at [[WP:ANRFC]] I am closing this discussion as: MERGE. My reasons are as follows: 1) There seems to be strong, if not unanimous consensus that the Anti-Katyn article should not remain as a stand alone piece. 2) One editor said there was not anything worth merging but that does not preclude a merger outcome of this discussion as [[WP:MERGE]] says a &quot;merger may be full or selective&quot; and duplicate or irrelevant content may be discarded.  3) Those that feel that some or all of the content in Anti-Katyn should be included in [[Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919-1924)]] are welcome to place that content there but that action also does not preclude the merger of Anti-Katyn with this article which was clearly indicated by Binksternet and United States Man as their recommended course of action.

Should [[Anti-Katy≈Ñ]] be merged into [[Katyn massacre]]? [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 18:39, 11 January 2014 (UTC)

===Discussion===
*'''Merge'''. The [[Anti-Katy≈Ñ]] concept is just a small part of the whole Katyn massacre topic. If the anti- concept is presented alone, it will need the whole massacre topic as context. The solution is to merge them. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 18:39, 11 January 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' ‚Äì Agreed that the concept is just a small part of the whole Katyn massacre topic and they should be merged into one article. [[User:United States Man|United States Man]] ([[User talk:United States Man|talk]]) 00:36, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. This concept seems to fail notability, through the merge target should probably be an article on [[Katyn denial]], rather than here. --&lt;sub style=&quot;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&amp;#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&quot;&gt; reply here&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 00:45, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
*The article is about instrumental usage of the [[Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919‚Äì24)]] in Soviet and Russian propaganda rather than about Katy≈Ñ crime or &quot;Katy≈Ñ denial&quot; (doesn't exist). It may be possibly merged with the &quot;Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919‚Äì24)&quot; or &quot;Soviet propaganda regarding WWII&quot; or &quot;Russian propaganda regarding WWII&quot; (both don't exist, [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union]] does).
*Please help to develop the article using the Polish one [[:pl:Anty-Katy≈Ñ]].
[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 07:32, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment'''. There is nothing to merge here. The &quot;article&quot; is a random collection of sentences on the topic of Katyn denial. The &quot;main idea&quot; - some Russian politicians and pundits trying to &quot;offset&quot; the massacre with the [[Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919‚Äì24)|deaths of Russian POWs in the previous war]] - is already given due weight in the &quot;Polish-Russian relations&quot; section (and in a much more concise manner, too). --[[User:Illythr|illythr]] ([[User talk:Illythr|talk]]) 19:48, 14 January 2014 (UTC)
**'''Answer to the comment''' - the &quot;Polish-Russian relations&quot; section doesn't inform about the Gorbachev's role. You yourself write ''is already given due weight'' and I agree - this article isn't the right place to continue the subject, it's 115,198 bytes long and still growing; But maybe the ''Revelations'' section should describe Gorbachev's action.[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 08:41, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
:::The subject of the article isn't ''the topic of Katyn denial'' but the instrumental usage of Soviet POWs.
:::The ''anti-Katy≈Ñ'' subject should be also included in the [[Camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919‚Äì24)]] article. 
:::If a subect is covered in several articles, it's rational to create one main article.
:::You understand Russian language texts about the  alleged Polish crimes (what about the alleged Soviet crimes on Polish POWs?). Why don't you write a summary?[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 07:30, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

==Churchill's reaction==
I think there may be a slight error in the sentence that discusses Churchill's reaction.  That sentence now reads, &quot;In private, Churchill agreed that the atrocity was likely carried out by the Soviets. According to Edward Raczy≈Ñski, Churchill admitted on April 15, 1943, during a conversation with General Sikorski: 'Alas, the German revelations are probably true. The Bolsheviks can be very cruel'&quot;.[58]  The citation is to the Carlton book at page 105, which I do not have.  What I do have is a copy of Edward Raczynski's war diaries, titled &quot;In Allied London&quot; and published in English in 1962.  In that book, on page 141, Raczynski discusses the lunch he had with Churchill, Sikorski and Cadogan on April 15, 1943.  He says that they discussed the dispute between Russia and Poland over frontiers, then says, &quot;This conversation took place a day or two after the announcement in Berlin of the discovery of the graves at Katyn.  We told him that we had concrete proof of the responsibility of the Soviet Commissariat of Internal Affairs.  Churchill, without commenting himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it.  He remarked: 'The Bolsheviks can be very cruel.' He added, however, that their ruthlessness was a source of strength, and was to our advantage as far as destroying Germans was concerned.&quot;  There is nothing further regarding this lunch.  Given that Churchill appears to have intentionally avoided any explicit agreement with the proposition that the Russians were to blame, it seems an overstatement to say that Churchill &quot;admitted&quot; that &quot;the Germans revelations are probably true.&quot;  Does anyone have the Carlton book?  Perhaps he cites some other source authored by Raczynski.  If he cites &quot;In Allied London&quot; then I propose that the sentence be changed.

It's been a couple weeks and there's been no objection, so I went ahead and changed the sentence, and the citation. [[User:Drochtegang|Drochtegang]] ([[User talk:Drochtegang|talk]]) 19:04, 7 December 2014 (UTC)

== 570,387 Polish citizens had been subjected to some form of Soviet political repression ==

Piotrowski probably means ''qualified'' persecutions - arrests, deportations to Siberia or Kasakhstan, killings. The number of Poles expelled after the war was above 1 000 000 and an expulsion is a form of political repression.[[User:Xx236|Xx236]] ([[User talk:Xx236|talk]]) 07:00, 17 April 2015 (UTC)

:Does this article mention the Volodymyr-Volynskyi crime? If not - what is the connection? Why don't you edit any Holocaust article or [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]]?[[User:Xx234|Xx234]] ([[User talk:Xx234|talk]]) 10:00, 2 February 2015 (UTC)
::Since you ask if the article mentions Volodymyr-Volynskyi, you appear to be implying that you did not read the article, if I am not mistaken.  Also, when you ask rhetorical questions such as &quot;why don't you edit any Holocaust articles?&quot;, I believe that you may be simply trying to be provocative.  I ask that you discontinue that.  None of us are holocaust deniers, and to insult us by name-calling is not behavior I want to see from fellow Wikipedians.  That aside, he information provided in the articles listed above appear to be valid and reliable.  I believe that it would be appropriate to add the above information into the article.  If you disagree, will you please explain, with substantial reasoning, why?  I apologize if I appear to be judgemental, but in the past I've seen you dismiss counter points by simply saying &quot;please respect victims&quot; or &quot;this is not the place for JFK was an alien theories.&quot;, both of which are ultimately weasel arguments.  Anti-Katyn may be a fringe viewpoint, but Wikipedia does not necessarily exclude fringe viewpoints from being presented; they simply should not be given undue weight.  I would argue that Anti-Katyn is at least prominent enough that it deserves to be given some amount of attention within the primary article.  While Soviet responsibility for Katyn is the dominant viewpoint, it is a fact that the documentation supporting it is far more sparse than that of Nazi crimes, which we can all agree are very real. Paradigm shifts do happen, you know.  Who's to say that that won't ever happen with Katyn?

:::Granted, Anti-Kaytn is not the dominant view, but to equate it to suggesting that JFK was an alien seems like an unncessesary exaggeration, if you ask me.

== Disturbing lack of evidence in the article==
I'm looking for actual photocopy's of these execution orders, or transcripts. The articles claim they exist and that they're referenced, but when I click the outside links they go straight to &quot;google books&quot; and just give the name/titles of the books rather than the actual content. Can people read these books and state whether these books have the actual transcripts of the see orders - or do they just merely reference them too?

== Regarding Grover Furr in further reading ==

Currently, there is no consensus regarding the general notability of Furr.  Unless that is achieved at a later point in time, I do not see any reason to remove his work about Katyn.  Remember that terms such as 'hobby historian' and 'JKF was an alien theories' are insufficient (see: [[WP:WEASEL]]).  Please also keep in mind that personal or family experiences with the article subject cannot directly interfere with explanations for actions.  E.g. 'respecting victims' does not constitute for removal of information.  If there community members that want the entry for Grover Furr removed, please allow discussion before taking action. [[User:Unrequestedsillything|Unrequestedsillything]] ([[User talk:Unrequestedsillything|talk]]) 01:49, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

:On the contrary, Grover Furr is a denier of Stalin's crimes who has zero credibility as a historian. Adding one of his denialist articles to the Wikipedia page about the Katyn massacre is like adding a holocaust denying article to the Wikipedia page about the holocaust. [[User:Ivanevian|Ivanevian]] ([[User talk:Ivanevian|talk]]) 07:01, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

::Please do not mislabel good-faith edits as vandalism.  If you have a reason for reverting content, please support the action with a constructive argument, rather than simply claiming that the subject has 'zero credibility'.  Remember that there is currently no consensus on Wikipedia regarding Furr's credibility whatsoever.

::I also fail to see how adding an alternative viewpoint on Stalin can be compared to holcaust denial.  Can you elaborate on your reasoning for comparing the two?

::I will not start and edit war here, but neither do I consider this conflict over.  It is clear to me that both of us have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] regarding the issue.  If a neutral point of view in the article is too difficult to ascertain, then I believe it will be best for both sides to be presented.

::I would also like to point out that there is information in the article claiming to support official story of the Katyn massacre that appears to be original research, as stated in the entry above.

:::::Grover Furr is not a reliable source for Katyn massacre history. He's an English language professor, so his expertise is not in military history.

::::::Please, enough of this 'insulting' nonsense.  This helps my discussion in no way.  Truth is truth, even if it is insulting, regardless of which side is true.  While I don't agree with you nor Binksternet regarding Katyn, at least he made a relevant case about Grover Furr.  I have no complaints about him since he actually explained why Grover Furr should not be here.  He contributed to the discussion without simply blowing me off by calling me a 'flat Earther'.
