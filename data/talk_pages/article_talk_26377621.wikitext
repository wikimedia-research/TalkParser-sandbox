== Pennsylvania park map ==

I have been aware of the Pennsylvania park map you made for a long time. What amazes me about it is that you can click on a dot on the map, and it leads straight to the respective park.

I am trying to figure out how to design a similar template. I would like for there to be a template with lines each corresponding to a street in a city, that when clicked on, lead to the article on that street. Additionally, there could be other blocks leading to the articles on different landmarks.

Any helpful hints on how to do this? [[User:Sebwite|Sebwite]] ([[User talk:Sebwite|talk]]) 21:51, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

Wow...That is unexpected. I wonder if a note should be sent to the DCNR, as it is their photo that's going to be on the main page; they might find it interesting. ​​​​​​&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;​​[[User:Niagara|&lt;font color=#5E2109&gt;''Niagara''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt&quot;&gt;​​&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Niagara|&lt;font color=#090931&gt;Don't give up the ship&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 18:02, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

== Christ myth theory and PR ==
A little while back you indicated that I might be able to submit the [[Christ myth theory]] article ahead of the normal 2 week wait period following a failed FAC.  Well, it's been a few days and we've made some minor changes.  If possible, I'd like to submit the article for peer review at this time.  What do ya' say?

When/if you can spare a little time, could you look at this at PR?

Nice...I especially like the panormama of the three lunettes in a row. Did you go anywhere else in or around Harrisburg? It's kinda ironic that I'm going to be passing near there today, granted only the dome will be visible (but I will see [[PRR 4859|4859]] up close again). ​​​​​​&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;​​[[User:Niagara|&lt;font color=#5E2109&gt;''Niagara''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt&quot;&gt;​​&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Niagara|&lt;font color=#090931&gt;Don't give up the ship&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 14:19, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

== Quehanna ==
A general read of [[Quehanna Wild Area]]. It looks fine so far. I know that the last paragraph of the lead will be fixed. I am sure much of the history can be transferred to [[Moshannon State Forest]]. Would you like for me to give it a close read now or wait for PR? Whenever is fine with me. I am going to add the new bits to [[Shikellamy State Park]] today. I haven't done a google news research on the PA state parks in sometime. I guess I'll do that too. I caught the info from the Daily Item while I was getting caught up on the local high school wrestling news. [[User:Dincher|Dincher]] ([[User talk:Dincher|talk]]) 22:29, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

== Request for FA ==

Hi. I saw you were involved in helping bring an article up to standard for FA. I am wondering if you would be kind enough to skim through [[Hurva Synagogue]] to see if there's anything you think needs attention? Gratefully, [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 13:43, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

== South Fork ==
[[South Fork, Pennsylvania|South Fork]] has been vandalized a good bit lately. Could you semi-protect it? The vandals are unregistered users. Best of luck with Quehanna. [[User:Dincher|Dincher]] ([[User talk:Dincher|talk]]) 23:28, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

== Help requested ==

Hi Ruhrfisch. I have been contacted by another editor who is willing to assist me at the Hurva article. I know [[User:Gilabrand]], unfortunaely blocked at present, to be very good at copyediting and would appreciate her help here. I am wondering whether it would be in order to unblock her in this instance so she can help promte Hurva Synagogue to FA, especially as I want to get this done asap (for March 15!). Regards, [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 23:46, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

==Thanks for the support==
Thanks (rather belatedly, I'm afraid) for the support for [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] as TFA for March 18. I honestly never suspected it would gather [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article/requests#March18 this degree of support]. Wow!

== Help with problematic editor ==

Thanks for the congrats :-)  Could you help me with a problematic editor?  You may have seen a comment thread on my talk, just above the DYK notification, by an editor who keeps removing information from [[FPT University]] for multiple problematic reasons.  Among these are &quot;I know it's false&quot;, claims that a reference should be removed because the link seems to have rotten, and apparent opposition to using a source because it's written in Vietnamese.  This user continues to say that a news source is unreliable, but s/he has never offered proof for its unreliability.  I just realised that I'm at 3RR, and it's not a case of blatant vandalism, so I can't do anything more.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 19:04, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

Would you look at this, which is listed for peer review? To me it looks like the merest sketch of an article, quite unready for review.

Ruhrfisch, thank you for your comments and helpful hints on my Saganagan Orogeny article.

My husband and I went to Fargo/Moorhead this weekend and while he was at his meetings I haunted two libraries. I didn't find much of anything on this topic (but did on some others I'm writing).

I do have a reference for Vaalbara being the theorized first continent, I'll get that reference in the article.

== Quehanna tornado ==

Unfortunately, a radar image probably won't be possible as the radar archives from the [[National Climatic Data Center|NCDC]] only go back to 1995. I did find a site that with photos and other information on the outbreak [http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/office/localinterest/1985Tornado/1985Tornado_film.html], but it doesn't seem to be relevant to Quehanna. A couple of thoughts after reading it: 
* [[Albion, Pennsylvania]] was the site of the F4 tornado, not Albion, Ohio
* What areas were the tornado watch and the tornado warning issued for?
* You may want to put in what the approximate size of a tennis ball is, as it is not a standard unit of measure and probably not universally understood.
* I'd mention why &quot;the inversion&quot; moving is significant.
Hopefully Quehanna is chosen for the April 1st TFA, as I'm not finding the other potentials quite as humorous. ​​​​​​&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:11pt&quot;&gt;​​[[User:Niagara|&lt;font color=#5E2109&gt;''Niagara''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Garamond; font-size:8pt&quot;&gt;​​&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Niagara|&lt;font color=#090931&gt;Don't give up the ship&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 15 March 2010 (UTC)

== Image muddle ==
No urgency, but can you help me resolve a small image problem? I uploaded [[:File:MahlerConcertProgramme1907.jpg]] a couple of weeks back. Then I noticed  that I had inadvertently scanned the message at the bottom, which shouldn't be part of the image. See file history: I cropped the message, but my attempts to upload the cropped version failed, so I reverted back to the original. Don't know what I did wrong - how can I get the image replaced with the cropped version? [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 00:14, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

==Urgent Peer Review request==
Hi Ruhrfisch, could you please make a [[WP:PR|Peer Review]] for the article [[Dhaka Residential Model College]]? Since the article failed to be a [[WP:Good Article]], I have significantly contributed to the article with a view to making it a [[WP:GA|GA]]. Recently the article also received authentic copy-edit. Before nominating the article for GA, I would like to have a PR to see if the article still lacks to be a GA. Would you please consider my request? Please inform your opinion in my [[User talk:Tanweer Morshed|talk page]] as soon as possible. Thank you. -- [[User:Tanweer Morshed|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#3B5998&quot;&gt;'''Tanweer'''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Tanweer Morshed|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#58bee0&quot;&gt;'''talk]]'''&lt;/span&gt;) 13:01, 23 March 2010 (UTC)

== Map help ==

A few days ago, I nominated [[Mummy Cave]] (written by Acroterion and me) for GA; the reviewer seems to think the article suitable overall, and most of the objections are simple wording issues that have been or soon will be corrected.  For some reason, the reviewer is objecting to the sourcing for the basic locator map, [[:File:USA Wyoming location map.svg]].  Have you ever encountered objections to the sourcing for locator maps in the past?  To me, they seem to be basic enough and dependent enough on things such as USGS topo maps that they don't need to attribte a specific source.  I'd appreciate your advice as to how to explain the usage of this map.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 15:16, 24 March 2010 (UTC)
:Thanks for the comments; there's no way to choose between the maps, but (due to a confusing and inaccurate reason for the change in the first place, which was done without discussion) I've reverted to the previous map, which is better because it includes a map of the USA with Wyoming highlighted.  Our reviewer seems to think that this page should be held to a higher standard than the multiple FAs that have dotmaps of this sort, but because I reverted the map, s/he passed it.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 22:25, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

Hey it's Hunter Kahn, I did the [[Parks and Recreation (season 1)]] page that you peer reviewed for me. The article is up for its [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Parks and Recreation (season 1)/archive2|second featured article nomination]]. As far as I could tell, prose issues were the only thing that held up the first FA nom, and now thanks to your peer review, I think they are addressed. However, the new FAC has received very little comments, and I'm worried that it might not pass simply for inactivity. Would you mind perhaps taking a look at it?

Hello, I'm trying to get into peer reviewing but I need to know the procedure for when a peer review is completed.  How long should it remain at WP:PR?

Thanks a bunch for the comments at the above; they've been very useful. I must admit a certain lack of regard for [[wp:lead]]'s requirement that all direct quotations be cited; it's more nuanced than that (no significant difference between &quot;Reviewers cited the 'riveting narrative{{'&quot;}} and &quot;Reviewers cited the engrossing story&quot;) but I shoved them in anyway. :-) Thanks again for your help,&amp;nbsp;[[User:Steve|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;'''Steve'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Steve|T]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Steve|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:08, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

I've posted a brief thank you note on the PR talkpage to acknowledge the help over the last few days, much of it from new reviewers, that prevented the backlog from spiralling out of control, as I thought it might.

Hi there, hope you are well. Its been a while since I last called on you, but I was wondering if you could assist me with a map once again. I'm working on an article on a campaign in 1794 in the [[Sunda Strait]] and I need a map adapting to suit the article and I was wondering if you could help. The map I need is [[:File:Yojakarta.JPG]], and I would need the white boundary lines and the green patch filling in the same colour as the surrounding land, all of the the names removed and &quot;Lampung&quot; replaced with &quot;Sumatra&quot; and &quot;Jabar&quot; replaced with &quot;Java&quot;. I would then use the red dots to pinpoint the locations of actions on the map myself. - Is this feasible and are you happy to do it?

== Mentor? ==

Hi,

As an accomplished writer I was wondering if you might be interested in taking a few minutes to offer some mentoring advice.

I recently tried for the first time to get an article through FA and failed. It's been through two peer reviews (and has passed GA). The FA review asked for some specific changes but mostly just said the whole article was poorly written without more detailed feedback. I'm pretty much stuck now, either for a lack of understanding of the FA criteria or for a fundamental lack of writing ability. :-(

The article is [[Free State of Galveston]]. At this point I either need somebody to take over the copyediting (since I don't know what more to do with it) or else get some hand-holding from a mentor who can show me the error of my ways.

Please don't feel obligated. Just wondering if you are interested ...

Could you do what's necessary to make [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Scooter (band)/archive1]] viewable to those who review FA nominations?  I found the nomination by accident, and obviously it won't get approved, but the nomination appears to be orphaned at the moment, and I can't figure out (1) whether the nomination should be on the &quot;archive1&quot; page or not, and (2) how to make this nomination visible.  While I don't know for certain that it's not visible, I expect that it would have been speedily closed a good while ago if it were visible to FA regulars.

At any rate, my interest is generally in topics obscure enough that there aren't tons of sources; I've almost never written an article longer or more comprehensive than [[St. John the Baptist Catholic Church (Maria Stein, Ohio)]], and I always do my best to gather all the sources I can find before I start writing.

I will expand the references to fix some of the links and dates accessed.  I will put todays date on pages from there as long as they haven't changed.  I will change links so that there is only one example of each link in the article.  The books themselve I chose because of they are book series that are recent and have an important niche to people.  There are many books that get so specific that very few people will use them.  I would consider the books on the page to be notable.  I am not sure how to do the alt text.

:::Thanks for keeping up on the conversation.  I in and out have time to work on the article at [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], but I understand your worries about the books notability.  Many of them are later editions of other books, but they get renamed.  This would be why some of the older books seem as if they have been ignored.  

These books are for the most part notable under: The book is the subject of instruction at multiple grade schools, high schools, universities or post-graduate programs in any particular country.  They are mostly graduate level books.  I will go a little more in depth on what they are used for as it will clear up the problem.  After my next batch of edits, I will ask you to look at it again and see if you still think the same way.  This will happen either tonight or within the next day or two.

== Peter Green on John Mayall's Bluesbreakers ==

Hey, please take a look on [[Wikimedia Commons]], there's a photo of [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]- which asks for verification that it's a free image. It was originally posted only to [[Wikipedia]] by an editor who it appears has a talk page of nothing BUT copyright-removed image notices. A BOT transferred it to Commons. There are two yellow tags asking to have the image checked, (and it still has not been checked) ''and'', it appears the SOURCE is Wikipedia and not some outer source. It's also on [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] article, and many other articles on other language Wikipedias but I think everyone is too trusting on this. Would you take a look?  Thanks. --[[User:Leahtwosaints|Leahtwosaints]] ([[User talk:Leahtwosaints|talk]]) 02:07, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

==[[Gustav Mahler]]==
Could I ask for your help on a couple of points?
*Translation from German: I am pretty sure that ''Das klagende Lied'' translates as &quot;Song of Lament&quot;, but am less sure about &quot;Lieder und Gesänge&quot; which I have as &quot;Songs and airs&quot;. Is this accurate?
*On a general point, in the article I have given English equivalents to the German names of Mahler's works, but have generally left other composers' works untranslated. There are many works mentioned, and to translate them all would in my view seriously disrupt the prose flow. Does this seem reasonable? None of the people who have looked at the article at peer review or on the talkpage have mentioned this point; maybe they haven't noticed. 

If you could look at these when you can find time I'd be most grateful. [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 21:35, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== Too bad.. ==

I'm sorry I was right about the Peter Green photo.. it's being used on a BUNCH of other language [[Wikipedia]]s. There aren't any others in [[Wikimedia Commons]], but I've already found some more in [[Flickr]] that I'll ask for. When I saw the person who posted that photo to Flickr, I knew for a fact it was a 95% chance it wasn't a good move, as &quot;Oddsock&quot;'s whole photostream (to my knowledge) is a collection of stuff he likes. It's good he puts the authors' names on the photos (sometimes, at least), but really, he shouldn't license them under an attribution [[Creative Commons]] license there on Flickr --[[User:Leahtwosaints|Leahtwosaints]] ([[User talk:Leahtwosaints|talk]]) 09:13, 15 April 2010 (UTC)

: WELL! What do you think should be done about that black and white photo of [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] that is being used both on this and several other language [[Wikipedia]]s? Can you speak to the Admins?  I ''did'' find a '''good photo''' of him, that I just placed in the infobox on Green's article, uploaded to Commons for us all to use. --[[User:Leahtwosaints|Leahtwosaints]] ([[User talk:Leahtwosaints|talk]]) 04:28, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

== [[May 2009 Southern Midwest derecho]] peer review ==

Thanks for the feedback!  There was a lot of content I will be looking over when I have the time since you had a lot of helpful suggestions.  Just a couple of quick notes:  I had a lot of trouble managing to reconcile this article with the layout from the severe weather wikiproject; usually an article has sections at the end for each of the tornadoes, but since this was a wind storm with a continuous damage path, I had a little more trouble figuring out how to format that.  I certainly like the idea of just a larger effects section, (I sort of had a dur moment when I saw that) but I'm thinking of just completely reorganizing the last few sections of the article.  So when I have some time, I'll be sure to work on the article and help out with a peer review myself.

Thanks again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

== [[Jordan River (Utah)]] Review ==

Thank you for doing the peer review for the Jordan River.
  
I had been using a couple of different FA rivers as templates, but the Johnson Creek article you showed me is much more applicable to the Jordan River... It really helped out alot.

I think I've hit most of your suggestions.  I would really appreciate it if you go over it again to see what I've missed or didn't do correctly.  I haven't touched the Ecology section as that needs a rewrite, so just ignore it.  I haven't sat down and done any proofreading.... I usually do that a few days after I write so it's a little more fresh.  So ignore any spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes.  I think after this exercise, I don't want to see, hear or have anyone mention the Jordan River.

btw.... those are very cute chinchillas you have in your photo.  Are they yours?  I miss my chinchilla Inky... seeing her eat raisins is still priceless. [[User:Bgwhite|Bgwhite]] ([[User talk:Bgwhite|talk]]) 01:36, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

==Peer review backlog==
The backlog is growing, and with Finetooth taking a well-deserved and overdue break from reviewing, it's likely to get longer. I propose to post the following banner on every new PR nomination:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Peer review is backlogged at the moment''', which could mean delays of up to two weeks before articles can be reviewed. '''You can help''', by choosing one of the articles in the backlog, and reviewing it. Please consider doing this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Please amend/expand this wording as you see fit. Do we have any guidance page. e.g. &quot;How to do a peer review&quot; to which we can refer, which might give some confidence to new reviewers? 

I will try to up my PR contribution to one review a day, but I am also trying to help at FAC, where Ealdgyth's departure has created a dearth of source reviews.

== Edit warring begin at [[Jerkcity]] ==

Don't know if you might want to get involved in this as an admin, but there's a situation developing over at [[Jerkcity]] where a person keeps adding &quot;Also, cocks&quot; to the lead sentence. There is a reference, but it's bogus in that it does nothing other than establish that the comic strip has used the term. The edit summaries and the talk page  tell a lot of the tale. Not too surprisingly, today a new editor showed up adding back the phrase as their first and only edit. The comic does actively lampoon Wikipedia, so they may have come in from that angle.

Adding the sentence fragment &quot;Also, cocks&quot; to a lead is borderline vandalism, but just enough on the &quot;maybe not&quot; line that it's become (my first) edit war where I can't blanket revert it as pure vandalism. I'm at 3RR myself on the issue. If you could provide additional input on where to go with this, I'd appreciate it. The whole thing is incredibly silly, but there is an important behavioral issue about creating and supporting useful and properly written content that comes with it. Thanks for any help. -- [[User:Michael Devore|Michael Devore]] ([[User talk:Michael Devore|talk]]) 03:11, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks, been so busy last day I haven't had time to look the article over again, but I'll make a probably futile effort sometime this weekend to talk editing sense to the other editor(s). I believe the comic strip has lampooned at least one Wikipedia editor by user name who has displeased the comic's author over changes to its article here, so editing involvement and cleanup may be negatively influenced in general. Me, I don't much care, but I am too busy to handle much foolishness right now. -- [[User:Michael Devore|Michael Devore]] ([[User talk:Michael Devore|talk]]) 19:26, 24 April 2010 (UTC)

:Certainly you have done a better job on Talk than I was doing with them (or him).

== Peer review of [[Distributed element filter]] ==

Thank you for your very useful review of this article.  The comments on providing context are particularly helpful to me - it is very easy to fail to see this kind of problem when one has familiarity with the subject.  By the way, not identifying the equipment in the lede picture was quite deliberate.  The filters have very general applications and I was trying to avoid associating them with something specific, but I can now see that this was a mistake as readers will want to know.

Could you help me out by specifically identifying the [[WP:CITE]] violations?  I do place citations after punctuation except where a reference is required to a specific phrase mid-sentence.  Also, please give me a link to the dab finder, I have forgotten where that tool is.  One more thing, can you identify where you are seeing sandwiched text?  The only place I see it in my browser is at figure 4, but it is not badly so, at full screen the column of text is still quite wide and in a small window the text unsandwiches itself.  The alternative is to place all the images on the same side, but they would then push down into another section which is a little ugly.

Once again thanks, I will be working to incorporate all of those suggestions before nominating for FAC.

Hi, I came across [[:en:Larrys Creek]] mostly because I just moved [[:Commons:Category:Larrys Creek|the commonscat Larrys Creek]] to [[:Commons:Category:Larry's Creek|Larry's Creek]]. The reason for the move being logic (it looks like a possessive &amp; thus need an apostophe) and [[:File:Larry's Creek Sign.JPG|this image]] of a sign which has an apostrophe. Now, I could be wrong and as I'm certainly no expert on this river I thought I'd ask you. Will I change it back to the way it was, or is it in fact correct that it should have an apostrophe?

==Your recent Peer Review of Protein Allergy==

Hello Ruhrfisch.  I'm just leaving you a quick note about your recent review of [[Protein allergy]].  It was a really great review, and all of the suggestions were excellent, thank you!  I've asked for an additional peer review not because there was anything lacking with your review, but because I'm feeling like another editor's input is needed (I also did a peer review a while ago at the original editor's request).  There's been a fairly strong push to get this article to GA status, which I don't quite think it's ready for, and I'm hoping another peer review will offer some unbiased opinions of the article's status (cause I'm seriously starting to get a complex about being the &quot;it's not ready yet!&quot; squad!).
