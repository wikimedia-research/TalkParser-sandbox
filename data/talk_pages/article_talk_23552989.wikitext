==Comment==
I'm not sure if this is the correct classification, and I'm sure there are others that are applicable, so please add them at will [[User:HJ Mitchell|HJ Mitchell]] ([[User talk:HJ Mitchell|talk]]) 18:36, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

==Revamping==
I've put a fairly major effort in to improve this. I've gone through and wikified links to other articles, I've tidied it up, consolidated some of the information, fiddled with the format a little, removed repetitions and, most importantly, added references to reliable, external sources- it took some trawling through Google but I got them!
However, everything I know about the subject, I read on this article first, so I cannot guarantee that I haven't removed or omitted key information, so I would urge anybody with a knowledge of the subject to check it for factual accuracy.
I'll try and keep an eye on the article. If anyone has any issues or questions regarding my editing or anything else, leave a note on my talk page and I'll do my best to help! [[User:HJ Mitchell|HJ Mitchell]] ([[User talk:HJ Mitchell|talk]]) 18:17, 13 April 2009 (UTC)
