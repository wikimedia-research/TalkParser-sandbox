== Name Based on Fiction ==

 In response to since when fiction has bee reliable source?
Many of the famous places has got its name from other mythological stories. Majority of ancient cities e.g, Athens on the name of goddess Athena.
So name of the village Suhwal have got its name from a Indian folk story and source is about the collection of these oratory traditioned story. if you will read the source link story involved about defeated King of Suhwal.

Maybe village doesn't have much presence on Internet. So it is hard to find other reliable source but existence of the folk story in some research project on these local stories can be a source.
