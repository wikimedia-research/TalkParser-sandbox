Neither Facebook nor Myspace are more valid or reliable than ''Forbes''. Just because a source isn't blacklisted doesn't necessarily mean it can be used. Also, there seems to be no indication whatsoever that the album has sold 20 million copies in the second Facebook reference. If you're convinced that the sales figure is actually higher, then find a reputable source that states so. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;georgia&quot; color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;[[User:SnapSnap|Snap]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;georgia&quot; color=&quot;#00BFFF&quot;&gt;[[User talk:SnapSnap|Snap]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 00:31, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
