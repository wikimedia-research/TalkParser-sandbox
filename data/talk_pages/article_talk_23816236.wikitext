==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:AppTek]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;A tag has been placed on '''[[:AppTek]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of '''[[:AppTek]]''' and leave a note on '''[[Talk:AppTek|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Hairhorn|Hairhorn]] ([[User talk:Hairhorn|talk]]) 21:05, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

In keeping with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy, edits where there is a conflict of interest, or where such a conflict might reasonably be inferred from the tone of the edit and the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. If you have a conflict of interest, you should '''avoid''' or '''exercise great caution''' when:
#'''editing''' or '''creating''' articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with;

I am going to delete the article [[AppTek]] ''in situ''.  If you think that the article is worthy of building, then attempt to do it as a subpage in your user space, get it so it is not-COI, maybe seek comment from others.  Once done, then it could be moved to the main namespace. -- [[User:Billinghurst|billinghurst]] ([[User talk:Billinghurst|talk]]) 11:14, 1 August 2009 (UTC)
