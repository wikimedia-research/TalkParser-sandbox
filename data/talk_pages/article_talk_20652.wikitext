&quot;A branch of a country's navy which fights on land.&quot;

:I believe that historically many ships carried marines to defend the ship itself from pirates, etc., rather than to fight on land per se. Can anyone clarify?

::You're right, and I removed the &quot;fights on land&quot; phrase. --[[user:the Epopt|the Epopt]]

----im askin bout ''Italic text''

&quot;Originated from the fact that it was an act of war for a country to send its army into another country but not to send its navy.&quot;

:Given that the phrase &quot;act of war&quot; is meaningless rhetorical noise -- there is no list of such things -- I doubt that this assertion is true.  Can anyone provide a citation?  --[[user:the Epopt|the Epopt]]

----i was asking bout space stuuf

I think this layout is fine. It's handy to know the different uses of the word &quot;Marine&quot;. But, yes, you're right - shouldn't this link to a proper page on &quot;Marine&quot;? Call it something else, because it's like typing in &quot;Piano&quot; and getting a list of Italian and French and Dutch words that &quot;Piano&quot; means in their languages. If you know what I mean.  [[User:86.135.177.146|86.135.177.146]]
