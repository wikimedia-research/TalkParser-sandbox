[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|'''WELCOME!!''']] Hello, {{PAGENAME}}! I want to personally welcome you on behalf of the [[Wikipedia]] community. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. If you haven't already, you can put yourself [[WP:NEW|new user log]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|list of users]] so you can be properly introduced to everyone. Don't forget to [[WP:Be bold|be bold]], and don't be afraid of hungry Wikipedians...there's a rule about [[Wikipedia:Don't_bite_the_newcomers|not biting newcomers]]. Some other good links are the [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|tutorial]], [[Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|how to edit a page]], or if you're really stuck, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]]. If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a [[User_talk:ViolinGirl|♪]] at my talk page...and again, welcome!--[[User:ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6699&quot;&gt;Violin&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;9999FF&quot;&gt;Girl&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;CC00FF&quot;&gt;♪&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
