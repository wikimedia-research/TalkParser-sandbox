===Cut starts here===
I took the liberty of removing some of the older entries from before 2004, and the ones that were irrelevent to the article, in part to try and make this page less than 32 kb.  This page could benefit greatly from an explanation of how logic relates to artificial languages, predicate, sentential and modal logic as prime examples.  This would also naturally involve a small digression on how logic relates to natural languages and linguistics in general, including say informal versus formal methods, and how natural deduction can be used to infer rules of inference.

Why does [[compound sentence]] redirect to logic?
:Seems to be a big mess of changing double redirects, I'll try to sort it out. Thanks for pointing that out [[User:Siroxo| ]]&amp;mdash;[[User:Siroxo|&lt;font color=#627562&gt;siro&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Siroxo|&lt;font color=#627562&gt;''&amp;chi;''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User:Siroxo|&lt;font color=#627562&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;]] 04:52, Sep 8, 2004 (UTC)

Who invented [[truth table]]s, [[Charles Pierce]] or [[Wittgenstein]]?  Who should get the credit?
----

Shouldn't this page include the basic logic relationships?  Why don't you add them to [[truth tables]], [[connective]], and [[quantifier]]?

----
Also the logic of relations, or polyadic quantification, which Quine said is what brought serious stature to logic as a field.  It might also be nice if there were a striking &amp; concise way to characterize the difference between formal or mathematical logic, &amp; algebra (as the theory of calculation), i.e., the heart of the difference between formal reasoning &amp; calculation, as opposed to lists of respective subfields.

== A Calculus Of Ignorance? ==

Thinking about statistics and the frequentist formulation of confidence intervals ( The population parameter is &quot;fixed but unknown&quot;) leads me to wonder if anyone has ever put the idea that something in a mathematical problem can be &quot;given to be unknown&quot; on a rigorous logical footing.  Suppose we have an a symbol p representing a a &quot;quantity&quot; in a mathematical problem, be it a statistical problem or otherwise. Some examples of thethings that we might be &quot;given&quot; about p are:

1. p is an unknown number.

2. p is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and std. dev.= 1

3. p is a normally distributed random variable with unknown mean and std. dev.= 1

4. p is a normally distributed random variable with unknown mean and unknown std. dev.

5. p is selected by a person who has flipped a fair coin. If the coin landed heads then he chose p to be an unknown but fixed number.  Otherwise p was chosen from a normal distribution with mean 0 and std. dev. 1.  How the coin landed is unknown.
(i.e. There is a 0.5 probability that p is &quot;fixed but unknown&quot; )

Lacking such a calculus, I , nevertheless attempt the following deductions:

If we are given 1) alone then an example of a valid conclusion is &quot;The probability that p = 23.2 is either 1 or 0&quot; (this follows famous textbook examples from statistics).  If we are given 2) alone then the previous conclusion is invalid.  
If we are given 3) alone then we may say &quot;The probability that {the probability that p = 23.2 is either 0 or 1} is 0&quot;. 
If we are given 5) alone then I don't think the previous conclusion is valid.
 
I'm sure these examples suggest even more mind boggling ones that make the frequentist assumption look like simplicity itself.  Has some obscure branch of logic worked all this out for us?  (I'm not talking about Bayesian statistics, which involves adding additional assumptions.)

===Domain Theory===
Dana Scott's theory of domains should handle the above kinds of uncertainty to your satisfaction.  The essential idea is that it is a kind of theory of types that is naturally related to a logic without the principle of excluded middle.

== Law of identity ==

Should not the logic page include the Law of Identity as one of the three laws of classical logic? That is: A is A or A = A.  It seems to me that this law of Identity is crucial to the application of the Law of Non-Contracdictories and the Law of Excluded Middle in determining the truth or error of a proposition. Afterall, Logic really is the mechanism by which we pursue truth and distinguish it from error. 

Perhaps the three laws of logic could be more understandable to those who are not aquainted with them as follows:

Law of Identity: A is A, or A = A. Something (a proposition or a thing) is what it is. Example: An apple is an apple. However, all apples are not identical, and any particular apple is not any other particular apple. Stating the law is not without difficulty. For example, a paricular apple is only a single example within the broad spectrum of the class concept of &quot;apple-ness.&quot; In this case, the law of identity is valid in making the detemination that, &quot;this particular apple is an example of what is subsummed under the class concept of &quot;apple-ness.&quot;&quot;

Law of Non Contradiction: A is not non-A. Something is what it is and not what it is not. Example: Applying the Law of Identity, an apple is an apple. Then applying the Law of Non-Contradiction, an apple is not anything an apple is not.  The law does not preclude the possibility that an apple could become something else, applesauce, for instance, but that an apple cannot be an apple and applesauce at the same time.

Law of Excluded Middle: A is B or non-B. Usually, when considering propositions, the Law of Excluded Middle is applied by stating that the proposition P is either true or false, with no third possibility (tertium quid) allowed. However, in keeping with our &quot;apple&quot; example in explaining the first two laws, we could state that, &quot;an apple is either a fruit or a non-fruit (a vegetable, or an animal)&quot;

It seems that the application of the laws as given in the examples above have a direct bearing on what the could be considered &quot;significant speech&quot; and in resolving the ever present problem of communicating propositions &quot;meaningfully&quot; by addressing the &quot;one within the many.&quot; 

The communication of a proposition &quot;meaningfully&quot; from one person to another is absolutely dependent upon the definitions of the terms in the minds of both. Since we've been using &quot;apples&quot; in our other examples, I'll stick with apples here. Unless both have the same class concept of what an apple is, then applying the Law of Non-Contradictories is meaningless.  For the term &quot;apple&quot; to have meaning and relevance, both the author of the proposition and the one to whom the proposition is communicated must have agreement about what consitutes the class concept of &quot;apple-ness.&quot; The more agreement within the class concept, the more &quot;meaningfullness&quot; being communicated.

If both the author of the proposition and the one to whom it is communicated do not have a significant alignment  on Identify, then applying the Law of Non-Contraditories is of no value in determining the &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;error&quot; of the proposition and neither is the application of the Law of Excluded Middle.

----

I have removed this, which I don't understand, from the formal logic section.

:In the calculus of classes, [[disjunction elimination]] and [[conjunction elimination]] are also invalid, for, from the statement that the class &lt;math&gt;a \cap b&lt;/math&gt; is null, we can't conclude that one of the classes a and b is null; and from the statement that the sum &lt;math&gt;a \cup b&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the whole we cannot conclude that either is equal to the whole.  But these implications are true in propositional logic.

I don't see that it is consistent with the linked definitions, for one thing.

The proof of non-contradiction in the Aristotelian Logic section contains the premise &quot;''it is only the law of non-contradiction that prevents &quot; can be&quot; from necessarily becoming &quot;is&quot;). ''&quot;.  This needs to be elaborated upon.  &quot;can be&quot; has no translation in propositional logic as far as I know.

----

As someone who studied mathematics at the university level, I think the statement copied below, and the &quot;proofs&quot; that follow do not prove that the laws of non-contradiction and the excluded middle aren't axioms in a formal mathematical system: 

:''Some have considered classical logic to be just like a mathematical theory, and in particular the laws of non-contradiction and the excluded middle to be simply axioms of the theory, which have to be assumed without proof. In fact this is not so...''

The reasoning in the &quot;proofs&quot; which follow that statement belong to something that I would characterize as meta-mathematics.  That is the &quot;proofs&quot; implicity assume that you know what is meant by the atoms &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.  But if you consider Aristotelian logic as a mathematical system then the atoms are only defined by their use in the two axioms.  In a mathematical system there is no way to define such basic terms as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; without the use of axioms.

Since the &quot;proofs&quot; given are interesting on philisophical level, I don't think erasing them would be warrented, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to make it clear that the &quot;proofs&quot; given don't satisfy actual mathematical rigor.

* The basic definition for computer LOGIC is that it is the sequence of operations performed by hardware or software. 

There is perhaps something useful to be said about computer logic (e.g. TTL), but this is simply confusing (and non-wikified) as a first paragraph. [[User:Bovlb|Bovlb]] 12:35, 2004 Apr 28 (UTC)

I'm just a curious beginner who found the logic article interesting, but would someone be kind enough to say whether Bill is a 'knight' or a 'knave' in example 3:

&gt;Logician: Are you both knights? John: Yes or No. Logician: Are you both &gt;knaves? John: Yes or No. 

&gt;Who is who?

I tried using the notation given for example 1, and went from

:&lt;math&gt;
(J \wedge ((J \wedge B) \vee (J \wedge B)') \wedge ((J' \wedge B') \vee (J' \wedge B')')) \vee (J' \wedge ((J \wedge B) \vee (J \wedge B)') \wedge ((J' \wedge B') \vee (J' \wedge B')')') = \mbox{tautology}
&lt;/math&gt;

to 

:&lt;math&gt;
J = \mbox{tautology}
&lt;/math&gt;

which seemed sensible as John is obviously a knight and there doesn't seem to be any information about Bill? ..Help :)

I suppose a point I'm trying to raise, is how beginner friendly should the wiki be. Should any rational thinking newbie be able to understand any given topic in the wiki by following enough links? ..or would this make the wiki too verbose?

== Page Goals and design ==

This article needs more careful editing.  


* For instance, predicate logic is a kind of formal logic (as well as propositional logic, temporal logic, Hoare logic, the calculus of constructions etc.) this isn't clear from the article and some at least cursory mention of this fact should be made.

* The distinction between formal logic and mathematical logic needs clarification.  Is it because it mathematics applied to logic (which I think is the answer) and in particular can include model theory and proof theory. 

* Aristotelian logic is important historically, and I am reasonably happy with essentially a link to the article of the same name which is informative. That probably could stay as it currently stands.

[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 00:25, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:Yeah, this article has some good info but definately needs more editing.  I think that the page itself should not be overly technical, which is the path it has taken recently.  Besides serving as a definition and glorified disambiguation page, it should definately give a good background of logic, probably even its history.
:*Devote the page &quot;Logic&quot; itself to a few things.
:*#What logic is, '''definition''' (this should obviously be on the page)
:*#The general, various '''goals''' of logic (to explain to people why it exists)
:*#The recently made '''informal vs. formal''' clarification.(Could be part of the definitions section)
:*#The current '''links to''' the various '''types''' of logic with short descriptions (Helps to disambiguate clearly)
:*#The '''background''' of logic, and '''history'''
:*I think the History of logic section should be the real heart of the article, actually.  It'll keep the article interesting to those browsing, and people just looking for a general idea of logic, and it'll also be a nice central place for information about logic in general.  It also won't get in the way of people that were looking for somethign more technical, because they'll find one of the disambiguation links first. The history section will also be excellent to help allow this page to link to the important people and results of logic, Aristotle, Descartes, Frege, Godel, Turing, etc...
:*In general, This page should be the defining Wikipedia page on logic, and basically be able to take you wherever you want to go, while providing lots of interesting information on the subject

::I recently removed the History part ''out'' becuase the information did not fit well with what was there. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the background of logic is. I think the reason to keep the history section out, other than a list of bulleted items and links, is that Historical questions and debates can be very difficult.  This way we can safely relegate that debate to  a different page. One thing I disliked with the previous versions of  this article was the presence of too many topics, some redundant and some far too wordy. 

::We also need to decide on some philosophical issues: An important distinction is between deductive and inductive logic.  This article I believe should be mainly deductive logic. Inductive logic is more complex.  This is different in my view from the distinction between empirical knowledge and a-priori knowledge. I'm perfectly happy to entertain the idea that logic is emprirical but discussions of this kind should not be a part of this article. 

::[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 01:22, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:::Yeah, i saw that you took the history out, and that is certianly fine with me, since it didn't fit well.  I'd advocate developing the history page more, in parallel with this page, and then perhaps reuniting them if it seems like a good idea.
:::I guess my main priority is to make sure this page remains useful beyond just a disambiguation and clarification page.  It should be useful as those, but should provide some more interesting content about what logic is, how it relates to other subjects (esp. philosophy), and how it developed over time.  Technical pieces should '''not''' be included, those should be relegated to whatever sub-topic they belong to, as they are for the most part.  Logic is a broad topic, so this should not try to hard to explain any one piece of it, but should try hard to put these pieces together, and then link to them.

I've created a possible outline for the logic page, I believe it can provide an excellent general idea of what logic is, with enough specifics to distinguish topics for the reader, and lead him/her to appropriate topics.  I also belive it provides a broad enough description of logic that it has the nature of an encyclopedia article. Please critique and make suggestions!

I am in general agreement with the outline. However, my most cherished principle of writing is this:
:''Lo bueno si breve, dos veces bueno'', 
which I learned in my Spanish Jesuit  high school, meaning ''The good if brief twice good''.  This principle is particularly important in an article on logic!

[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 16:35, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I've seen the page in a number of versions - none of them really good. I really think it suffers every time it gets closer to the kind of computer science thinking (roughly speaking, you can have any kind of formal system you want and call it the XYZ logic, if you think you have an application).

I'm not an expert, but the history tells one something. There was an old meaning of formal or symbolic logic (already in Kant?). In the nineteenth century logic was formalised first for pedagogic reasons (Boole, Lewis Carroll) - because it was still considered a pedagogic subject. Only with Frege did it really become once more a ''research'' area (after 2000 years). I don't believe there really was a subject called ''mathematical logic'', before Gödel. The need to write what he had done in a way that could be understood made for recursion theory first, and then model theory, as disciplines ''within'' mathematics. So basically one can say that the incompleteness theorem directly caused those developments. For example, for the Polish school at its foundation, logic was not 'inside' mathematics at all; but a separate subject. And before that the philosophers were sorting out [[philosophical logic]], i.e. parts of the logic of natural language that are difficult to formalise.  

After 1950 it really is all less clear ...

[[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 18:50, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Well I agree that specialized formal logics, particularly for reasoning about a specialized subjects such as concurrency or computer programs really should have a subordinate position in the article. I was trying to achieve that goal--- for this reason I introduced the section header highlighting the distinction between formal and informal logic. Apparently I didn't quite achieve that yet.  

However, I would stress the following points:

* Though history of logic is exceedingly important, it is also very specialized so that that this subject should be clearly delineated and preferably discussed somewhere else. 

* The logic page should have a practical purpose, for someone trying to distinguish between good and bad argument.  In this regard the article on ''logical fallacy'' is extremely important. See the paragraph in the intro to David H. Fischer's book ''Historians Fallacies'' dealing with the argument that emphasizing fallacies in logic is explaining how to get from Boston to New York by describing the roads that don't go there. His response: It is useful to know places where one might get lost in this trajetory. (Having done this trip many times, this is very good advice to have, particular near NY)

* The concept of a valid inference is important.  This article currently stresses ''deductive validity'' as opposed to ''inductive validity''.  This is OK, in my view since induction is much more complicated and uses ''deductive validity'' 

* Mathematical logic as we currently understand it (as is correctly formulated in the article [[mathematical logic]]: application of mathematics to logic and inference) probably does originate with Godel.  However, Peano, Poincare, Hilbert, Russell and Whitehead did refer to something called mathematical logic which today we might think of as sterile formalizations of mathematics. Symbolic logic is a term which is probably even older.

I noticed that the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' does not have an entry on '''Logic''' pure and simple. It has lots of entries ''logic of XYZ''.

== Plan of action for the logic page ==

Is there one? [[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 16:14, 20 Jun 2004 (UTC)
*I was busy the last couple weeks, but I have time to work on this page again. I suggest we start working on setting up a good introductory definition and make the clarifications very clear, then attack the rest of the page [[User:Siroxo| ]]&amp;mdash;[[User:Siroxo|siro]][[User talk:Siroxo|''&amp;chi;'']][[User:Siroxo|o]] 03:31, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
:: One of the things which is not clear from the introduction currently is the difference between ''[[inference]]'' and ''[[argument]]''.  Argument I guess is the linguistic or symbolic expression of inference. One can infer something (in one's head)  without an argument.[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 04:12, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I suggest: traditional logic discussed in general terms, up to the time of Boole and Mill (on induction) when things started to shift. Then mathematical logic Frege up to about 1940 (when the structure of the subject had become reasonably clear). [[Philosophical logic]] had a definite meaning for Russell, which then moved somewhat; but this is still a key area for [[analytic philosopher]]s.

I just reworked the intro a bit.  Tried to make it flow better, as well as adding an idea or two.  One note, I think the first sentance, as it is in the new version, is required.  In common conversation, logic basically just refers to the reasoning used to reach a conclusion.  I think we should allude to that, and then introduce the formal concept.  This will even help to reinforce the formal view of logic to people who have not studied it, as well as easing people into the article.

I also resectionized the first couple sections, and dropped the deductive/inductive thing into there, I hope it fits better like that.

Regarding inference/argument, I'm not sure how to convey that in this page, but it might be an interesting addition.

I made some small changes to the first paragraph.

* Replaced'' at its most basic'' with ''ordinary language''. I think that's what we mean; although go ahead and revert if you disagree.  I'm not trying to be ideological. I have a nasty habit of pondering every word, which means I never get very far.

* I used ''inference'' instead of argument-- argument implies communication.  I've spent some time working on the article [[logical argument]] where that distinction is made.

* Corrected two typos (assumption was mispelled)

The most recent edit (Lorenzo Martelli) tries to clarify the situation in which the assumptions are inconsistent --- is this really necessary? If they are inconsistent, the premises will never hold and by the meaning of material impication, validity is vacuously true. Mainly I don't think this should be put into the introduction, maybe some other place. Otherwise the introduction is very rapidly going to get unwiedly. [[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 15:36, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Reply from Lorenzo: I agree in general with your comments CSTAR. Maybe then we should just leave in the qualification 'for most intents and purposes'? What I think would be wrong would be to have a statement beginning 'Validity means .....' in the introduction to an article on Logic, if that statement is not 100% accurate. After all, half of the reason behind formal logic was to get rid of the ambiguities...!I also think we should put somewhere in the article a strict definition of validity, of the form 'an argument is valid if and only if...' to ensure it is clear and referenceable, and that all that follows (the paradox of entailment etc, why truth tables are so important)can be explained through/referred back to the definition. Hope you agree and if so feel free to move my comments to a more appropriate place.

:Validity is important enough to define on the page without going into the detail of the [[validity]] article.  Where it is right now seems quite appropriate, as a reader interested mainly in validiity will click the link in the intro, and a reader interested in logic will still get a chance to see basically what it means.  Now we shoudl figure out how to approach all these types of logic.  I like having small introductions with &quot;Main article&quot; links.  It helps to give a deeper background of what logic is, and to disambiguate, but we need to organize them appropriately and give them a good introduction explaingin why they are divided such [[User:Siroxo| ]]&amp;mdash;[[User:Siroxo|siro]][[User talk:Siroxo|''&amp;chi;'']][[User:Siroxo|o]] 19:54, Jun 24, 2004 (UTC)
:: I think one way one can argue that logic is an empirical science is that various notions of validity are [[model]]s of an ideal notion of validity.  This isn't too hard to argue for inductive validity and definiong deductive validity in some semantic way is also an approximation.  I agree these should be placed in the article, but not in paragraph 1.[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 20:09, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Specialized logics ==

Could we collapse the sections on Multi-valued logic and Logic in Computer science into a single section, say ''specialized logics''.  Also I prefer to use ''inference'' instead of ''reasoning'' in the section currently titled deductive and inductive reasoning. For example. inference could be procedural, i.e., apply Matlab to infer something.  I think also a sentence or two on the distinction (and also relations) between inference and [[logical argument]] is necessary.  [[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 16:07, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)
*I made minor expansions to multi-valued logic, but I believe that since several major concepts in logic, and related concepts are founded in multi-valued logic, it should have its own section.  I divided otu the CS/AI section from what I now call &quot;Types of logic&quot; (needs a better name), and I think it sits well as a separate idea.  Also, IMHO, you should feel free to make any changes regarding inference/reasoning/logical argument.  If they are confusing, just make an explanation.  The page will evolve to incorporate them even better, as well. [[User:Siroxo| ]]&amp;mdash;[[User:Siroxo|siro]][[User talk:Siroxo|''&amp;chi;'']][[User:Siroxo|o]] 11:40, Jul 5, 2004 (UTC)

== Possible revision of first paragraph ==

I know we have beat this subject to death, but I am still unhappy with some of our characterizations of logic given in the 1st paragraph,  particularly, since in the broad sense that logic traditionally has had in philosophy, it is concerned with the structure of inference.  Thus I propose a change starting at the second sentence: 

:More formally, logic is concerned with inference, that is, the process whereby new assertions are produced from already established ones.  Of particular concern in logic is first, the structure of inference, that is the formal relations between the  the newly produced assertions and the previously established ones (formal, in the sense of being independent of the assertions themselves) and second the investigation of ''validity'' of inference, including various possible definitions of validity and practical conditions for its determination.  It is thus seen that logic plays an important role in [[epistemology]], that is it provides a mechanism for extension of knowledge.

[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 04:33, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Excellent, worth beating to death if it can be clarified better (;  Yours is much clearer about the general idea of formal logic. I've repasted it here, with a couple grammatical changes I suggest for clarity.

* Central tools of logicians: proof theory, model theory, and possibly more sophistcatedly mathematical tools such as set theory, recursion theory and category theory.
* Controversies in logic: eg. intuitionism, relevantism.

Intuitionism and relevantism probably deserve a mention. I'm not too familiar with the modern research you allude to.

I've created two short articles [[semantics of logic]] and [[proof-theoretic semantics]] (among others) prior to editing the Logic page proper.  Close readers may notice that there are some disagreements of fact between those articles and this one. Comments welcome. ---- [[User:Chalst|Charles Stewart]] 23:35, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: Although my own preference is not to regard [[proof-theoretic semantics]] as semantics,  you are right to include them both. However, I think it would be far too narrow to exclude informal logic within the broadest scope of logic. I for one am not sure where to draw the line between logic and non-logic; For this reason I prefer to think of logic as the structure of inference and as a particular case the structure of argument.  For instance ''Structure'' of argumentative dialogue  can be (and recently has been) formalized as a communication protocol where messages sent or received by a protocol participant depend on current commitments and pending challenges.  Also structure of argument is important in just about any field of endeavor -- economics and political science come to mind.  The play between formal models and informal reasoning is intriguing.

: None of this is intended to dissuade you from including those articles in the logic page.  They are well-written, but I don't think it would be accurate to entirely supplant logic with this formalized idealization.[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 02:30, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the comments.  These other pages are meant to stand on their own, they are really stubs and need much more development, and I plan on putting shorter summaries of the topics on the main logic page.  Regarding informal logic: I am a partisan on this issue -- the opening sentence of my doctoral thesis runs &quot;Logic is the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form&quot;, and the first footnote says, in effect, that the term informal logic is perhaps a misnomer -- it is the study of arguments whose form is concealed in the deep structure of language. ---- [[User:Chalst|Charles Stewart]] 09:43, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::: That view of informal logic is fine by me; I  just try to be careful not to fall into naive reductionism --- that natural language reasoning is either meaningless or reducible to reasoning in a formal sequent calculus (I tend to fall into this, being a mathematician ). Maybe you should have at the [[logic]] page, and while your at it, also the [[logical argument]] page. I also started a [[political argument]] page which is in need of serious attention.

== Types of Logic ==

I don't like the current organisation of this section.  It's
possible to organise logic by its formal type, when one gets a
list along the lines of:
* Syllogistic
* Stoic (propositional)
* Boolean
* Predicate
* Other

Or one can organise it by motivation/application, and get:
* Philosophical
* Dialectical (Aristotle's motivation for the Organon was as a tool for reasoning and argument)
* Mathematical
* Computational

Mixing the two axes, as is done now, though, seems like a recipe for
confusion.  The first list seems more important to me.

Furthermore, &quot;Multi-valued logic&quot; as a category of logic, is just wrong.  It's an issue in the semantics of logic: one can give multi-valued semantics to FOL, and there are non-bivalent logics, such as intuitionistic logic, that are not commonly treated as being truth-valued at all.  The existence of multi-valued logics is maybe appropriate in a semantics section, or in the section I proposed earlier on controversies in logic.

If there are no objections, I'm planning on applying a series of changes in the next few days, starting from tomorrow evening ---- [[User:Chalst|Charles Stewart]] 14:31, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: I agree that Multi-valued logic as a category is wrong, although the preferability of one &quot;axis&quot; to another is not clear to me - yet; I also think that the distinction currently made between &quot;informal logic&quot; and &quot;formal logics&quot; at the beginning of the article is useful.[[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 14:44, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

===Big changes applied===
Now applied the restructring I've been threatening...
Two issues:

''[[Aristotelian logic]] is sometimes referred to as formal logic because it specifically deals with forms of reasoning, but is not formal in the sense we use it here or as is common in current usage.  It can be considered as a precursor to formal logic.''
* I've deleted this, because I think it is wrong: it is perfectly easy to see how syllogistic is formal, c.f. the work of John Corcoran expressing syllogistic in modern notation.  Do any authorities seriously dispute the formal nature of syllogistic?  I would be surprised.  I've completely rewritten these paragraphs.

''Mathematical logic refers to two distinct areas of research: The first,  primarily of historical interest, is the use of formal logic to study mathematical reasoning''
:Not at all!  The application of logic to the study of mathematics and mathematical proofs is still one of the main driving forces of mathemcatical logic.  Just look at applied model theory, reverse mathematics, Borel spaces.  I've completely rewritten this paragraph.

----
:: I obect! I  wrote that sentence! By that I meant the following: once it became clear (in historical time possibly in the late 1920s but I'm guessing) that informal arguments in mathematics can be reduced to purely formal proofs, hardly anyone regarded purely formal proofs as useful (caveat of course: formal verification does stress formal proof and it is useful, I suppose for many critical applications, but it is highly debatable whether formal proof-checking is mathematics at all! Despite MIZAR and Isabelle, in the current state of the mathematical sciences it would be misleading, I think, to regard this area  is of any interest outside of a relatively small group of specialists.  This of course is a sociological fact more than anything else, but in fact the assertion in question is also sociological).  Notice that I stated  
::: use of formal logic to study mathematical ''reasoning''

::  The area of research you describe in Borel spaces or model theory (which I think would include non-standard analysis) could be called ''formal logic'' only by a stretch, I think. In other words, though logic may occur in the subject of these investigations, logic is itself regarded as an object of study (e.g., somewhat fancifully, say one could regard formal structures as a kind of space on which a group acts such as a Tits building or some such thing -- and actually as you point out above somewhere domain theory is an area where the mathematization of formal systems becomes more visible ).  [[User:CSTAR|CSTAR]] 02:55, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::: I guess it's possible to argue that both what I changed this section from and what I changed it to are not NPOVs.  I hope not, because I like what I wrote.  OK, quibbles with what you wrote first: all the stuff about Borel sets, analytic sets, projective sets did change the systems that set theorists studied, since they gave rise to new large cardinal axioms via the work on descriptive set theory.  By applied model theory, I mean the stuff that MacIntyre was doing -- applying model theoretic techniques to algebra to get new mathematical results algebraists think are valuable; it really couldn't be a clearer application of logic to mathematics; whilst in reverse mathematics, you need to really go back and think about how you prove things one is really recreating mathematics according to logically imposed constraints.  With Macintyre's work, I think it couldn't be clearer that the objectives are mathematical ones (indeed, see [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1997-October/000088.html] why this might not be logic anymore...), and withthe other two, while we may have foundational motivations for studying them, it should be clear that the objects of study themselves are mathematical.  I think from this point of view, what I wrote is OK (do I need to say more so that this is clear?)

:::: There is another issue you raise, namely that few logicians (the applied model theorists being exceptions) are genuinely close to mathematical practice.  In fact I'm reading a nice book by David Corfield at the moment &quot;Towards a Philosophy of Real Mathematics&quot;, and it is abundantly clear that he would agree with you.  When a logician studies mathematics, he learns something, but not something that is of much use to the mathematician, and this is something that the pioneers of mathematical logic did not expect.

:::: Resolution: maybe we need to divide up mathematical logic into more kinds of activity: both foundations of mathematics and applied logic would fall under ''the use of formal logic to study mathematical reasoning'', and maybe we need to make clear that these are two different kinds of activity. ---- [[User:Chalst|Charles Stewart]] 10:01, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)
----
::::: Do I have the right indentation here?... :) 

::::: Yes I generally I am very happy with what you wrote -- though I think the point I raise is more than a minor quibble. In applying ''logic'' (i.e. model theory) to mathematics in the way you mention  is hardly different than noting that the transfer principle is useful in translating certain nonstandard statements to standard ones. I use this equivalence just because I am very familiar with non-standard analysis. Now where does logic begin or end in non-standard analysis? This is the perennial question, what are the limits of pure logic? I certainly don't know. 

::::: But my main point is that the study of logic and logical systems is more like the emprirical study of physics: There are these systems of inference, we propose models for them and study them using mathematics. I believe a very weak version of this in that I am not a Putnamist on this, i.e., I am not prepared to argue as does Putnam that logic is empirical.  See [[Quantum logic]].

:I merged the &quot;types of logic&quot; and &quot;motivations for logic&quot; sections, because it was confusing to have types split between the two.

::Hmmm.  I separated them out because it was clear to me that they were different kinds of subsection: in particular, I don't think that, say, mathematical logic is a type of logic, but rather a set of interests and concerns that certain kinds of logician bring to whatever branch of logic they study.  Philosophical logicians and mathematical logicians study one and the same first-order logic, and they study one and the same S4 modal logical system.  Instead, they just ask different questions about them, and do different kinds of investigations into them.  I agree, though, that &quot;motivations for logic&quot; was a clumsy section heading.  Maybe &quot;Types of logician&quot; would be better...

== Mathematical logic ==

The article currently states:

::Both the statement of Hilbert's Program and it's refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of proof theory. 


Is model theory usually considered part of proof theory?

: No, but in context, Hilbert's program centred on the role of consistency statements, which are considered a part of proof theory.  Goedel's completeness theorem states a key result in model theory, but the machinery he used to prove it is proof-theoretic (the original theorem used esentially a proof search algorithm).

If so that's news to me. Model theory certainly is mathematics applied to logic. 

:: If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject. Set theory originated in the study of the infinite by Cantor, and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from Cantor's theorem, through the status of the Axiom of Choice and the question of the independence of the continuum hypothesis, to the modern debate on large cardinal axioms.

These seem like fairly subjective evaluations.  Are we sure it's four pillars and say not...sixty five pillars? (I'm being a little facetious here purposely to spice up the discussion) . I concede that these boundaries are really murky, but is set theory really logic? 

:Indeed, it is subjective, so maybe a remark to that end is in order.  But it's a pretty standard way of dividing up the field since Barwise's 1977 Handbook of Math. logic.

And I think we should be less harsh on the logicist programme. Saying it was a failure really gives an erroneous impression.  The logicist program did succeed in one way:  As a result of the logicist programme it became abundantly clear that mathematical reasoning is in principle reducible to a formal calculus (if anybody has enough time or funding on their hands to do it)

== Dialectics and rhetoric ==

I think the article still gives short-shrift to Dialectic and rhetoric.  It ignores the work of Chaim Perelman and Tyteca-Olbrechts on argument. This is briefly mentioned in [[logical argument]].

:I've put a comment on the talk page of that article.

== Logic is not the study of reasoning ==

Or rather, to claim it is, is to take a psychologistic view of logic, one that is almost universally rejected by modern logicians, although one that was popular in the last half of the 19th century.  The psychology of cognition is the study of reason. &amp;mdash; ''Charles Stewart'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Chalst|(talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 08:52, 11 February 2010 (UTC)
:Do you have a proposal for alternative text?  I think your objection is valid when you're looking up close in detail, but on the other hand &quot;the study of reasoning&quot; is a reasonable description of the broad motivations of logic.  It has the ring of a traditional definition (like the one at [[mathematics]] about &quot;time, space, structure, quantity, change&quot; or whatever it says now).  I would kind of expect &quot;study of reasoning&quot; to be at least ''mentioned'', though I agree that it's problematic to present it as comprising logic as a whole. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 22:14, 11 February 2010 (UTC)
::How about what we had before, the last time I complained about the poor lede and fixed it?  I've really no interest in applying edits to the logic articles that will just get changed by people who have their own ideas, and aren't willing to see that they are just personal opinions.  I am not willing to take any responsibility for the contents of this article anymore.  I'll just drop by a couple of times a year and maybe complain nonconstructively.
::The problem with &quot;study of reasoning&quot; is two fold: plenty of reasoning is subject specific &quot;I hear the kettle whistling and so I infer the water for my tea is boiling&quot;, and second, most logicians don't consider the pragmatics of how logical inference is actually carried out to be within the scope of logic, but rather part of epsitemology or psychology.

== 2nd nonconstructive complaint ==

I see that the article has a new, up-to-date reference for &quot;Logic is the study of arguments&quot;, from the 2002 book by the Catholic philosopher, [http://www.jcu.edu/philosophy/gensler/ Harry Gensler], of the [http://www.jcu.edu John Carroll University], a Jesuit theological college.

Modern Catholic teaching of logic has perhaps been unduly neglected in Wikiedpia's treatment of logic, but it is certainly not mainstream.  What, precisely, is wrong with the definition in the Collins Encyclopedia, which was edited by the highly accomplished scholar, [[David Crystal]]?  What is the attraction of this offbeat definition of logic, that we have to spend so much effort furnishing it with references?  Is Harry Gensler really being held up as such a great authority that can tell us that Tarski's characterisation of logic as concerning non-subject specific consequence has been overturned?

Perhaps this article will attract attention from a competent editor who can see beyond their personal views on what logic is, and see how experts use the term.  Until then, look out for my 3rd nonconstructive complaint. &amp;mdash; ''Charles Stewart'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Chalst|(talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 10:12, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

== Logic-the tool. ==

	I propose that the description of [[Logic]] should be fundamentally altered. To say that logic is 'the tool for distinguishing between the true and the falce' is to say that there is an observer who uses 'the tool' to judge what is true and what is falce. This does not say what that 'tool' is. That which is observed in the observers consciousness in the 'now' is a static picture. Using logic the observer, under the influence of motivation, alters that picture for another picture in the next 'now'. The change occurs in time. Both pictures are static at the time of observation. What is it that directed the alteration of the first picture to the second picture ? The observed picture in the first 'now' consists of parts. Each part is an independent truth defining the whole of the picture. The same applies to the picture in the second 'now', after change. Some of the truths of the description are common for pictures in both observations. The more of the truths of the description are common the stronger is the logical connection. Logic is like magnet. It has variable strength depending on how many truths about the two interacting  pictures are common.

== Induction as Logic? ==

I think that in general, inductive reasoning is not considered logic; that is purely restricted to deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning commits the inductive fallacy and is illogical. To give an example of inductive reasoning and why it is flawed, consider the following example: a hen who is fed and taken care of by a farmer day after day. The hen could inductively conclude, that the farmer will continue to do so based on this observation, corresponding to a premise in deductive reasoning. However, one day the hen is butchered by the farmer and fed to the family. Clearly the conclusion the hen came to was flawed -- it assumed constancy in the universe. This is the flaw of induction and why it should not be compared so closely with deduction. This article should be edited to express that.

== &quot;Logic garnet&quot; ==

A new user has added an intriguing picture of a so-called &quot;logic garnet&quot;, claiming that it's an &quot;early device used to determine the logical consistency of a given claim&quot;.  We don't have any article directly on this, but we do have one on [[Shea Zellweger]], who seems to be the inventor.  Zellweger was born in 1925, so the thing can't be that &quot;early&quot; really.

I don't mind the picture, and a mention, somewhere in the article, but I'm not sure that an idiosyncratic notation deserves to be placed so prominently at the top.

== MAJOR problem with this article ==

The first two sentences of this article are self-contradictory.

&quot;Logic is the study of valid reasoning. Logic is used in most intellectual activities.&quot;

This is entirely wrong.  The study of valid reasoning is most definitely NOT used in most intellectual activities.

Are you people okay with me changing it in a major way?  


Another contradiction, still in the opening paragraph, is mention of &quot;The study of logic&quot;.  Since &quot;logic&quot; has been defined in the first sentence as &quot;The study of valid reasoning&quot; then &quot;the study of logic&quot; would be the study of the study of valid reasoning.  This is ridiculous.  Am I the only person who can see this?

::I see your point, but you should only make a change if you have a good source. I'll look for some authoritative pronouncement on the subject of whether logic is a study or that which is studied.[[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] ([[User talk:Rick Norwood|talk]]) 15:49, 4 July 2012 (UTC)

::The idea that logic is the study of (some kinds of) argument is well-established.  See [[Definitions of logic]].  There isn't much of a paradox here: logic is primarily a study of arguments, but it is also the name we give to systems of inference that arise from that study.
::I do find myself visiting these talk pages mostly to point out how the logic article has been in slow decline since 2009, and feel apologetic for that, but compare the lede from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logic&amp;oldid=300599816 to that of the current article: that both better avoided making needless assertions (the substantial assertion it does make not now made is that formal systematic study of argument begins in Ancient Greece, not India or China), and did a better job of delivering the things a lede should deliver, such as a clear definition of the topic matter. &amp;mdash; ''Charles Stewart'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Chalst|(talk)]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:46, 13 August 2012 (UTC)

== Logical Absolutes ==

Should this topic be discussed ?
https://school.carm.org/amember/files/demo3/2_logic/absolutes.htm
i think that its something that could be included in this topic, otherwise maybe it should have its own page

== My logic (Open to debate) ==

'''Under Construction...'''

'''Science'''(knowledge), is acquired by all the entities in the diagram.

'''Philosophy''' (love of wisdom), I believe 'love of wisdom' is inherent in acquiring knowledge,
as otherwise, there is no reason to want knowledge. To get knowledge, you must first, have wanted it, in the first-place. (the purpose/knowledge wanted is irrelevant)


In an abstract way, (although the concepts are already abstract...) to have knowledge, you must at least have be able to 'know' something...or, anything... What is something/anything? '''The/a universe''' - what makes up a universe? The universe is made up of, ''''physics', and 'meta-physics'.'''       '''(MST UPDATE)'''

Which I then class into two separate forms of base-logic. Rational-logic, and irrational-logic.
or intelligence, or intellect... '''(MST UPDATE)'''  

My source? Hopefully, the people of Wikipedia see it as credible...

What are you tripping on?
How does this differ from Kant's boring old ancient analytic-synthetic distinction? Have you just changed some words around and added two differently spelled synonyms &quot;intellect&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; like you're bloody Derrida or summat?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/192.155.82.44|192.155.82.44]] ([[User talk:192.155.82.44|talk]]) 06:26, 4 February 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== I love logic and simply being here on Earth as a savvy human ==

Logic is how we humans think. If it is not logical, then it is questionable.

== Rejecting Logical Truths ==

I have to say I kind of disagree with some of the policies that wikipedia encourages for this article, verifiability in particular (not a fan of Popper). I have also, unintentionally overridden the discussion that has been going on behind the scenes here by just editing. So I am posting this to give yall a heads up and to say sorry, please edit my writing, but at least take it into account.

I was reading the bit at the end of Rejecting Logical Truths and I was really disappointed with the critiques given of Nietzsche. They were clearly partisan and I think the tone and content was pretty weak. Ive gone ahead and responded to each critique. I got quite angry with the Russell one in particular so that should probably be changed. But still i think this really needs to be looked at because the way it stood it seemed like some kind of definite rejection of the rejection but which is not convincing at all.

I also offered my kind of interpretation which I think would stem from a kind of positivistic attitude although i myself am really into the whole frankfurt critique of instrumental rationality and the positivists that are associated with that... So ye im also against imparciality. I think the article should vehemently argue for the competeing positions but allow them all up there! This may look contradictory but im all about paraconsistency!

Lots of love!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/192.155.82.44|192.155.82.44]] ([[User talk:192.155.82.44|talk]]) 06:22, 4 February 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mathematical/Symbolic/Formal Logic ==

The first section under &quot;The study of logic&quot; divides logic into four categories: informal, formal, symbolic and mathematical, whereof all but the first links to mathematical logic, where they are listed as synonyms. It also seems to be more confusion over these three terms later in the article. I'm not sure exactly what are the most recognized relationship between these terms, but we need to try to make it more consistent. –[[User:St.nerol|St.nerol]] ([[User talk:St.nerol|talk]]) 17:42, 27 May 2013 (UTC)

::As it stands, that section only provides references to the content of each of the four categories, not to the fact that there are four categories.  We need a broader reference.  In my experience, the examples are good ones, but we need a reference that says so.  In any case, while all mathematical logic is formal, not all formal logic is mathematical.  Some formal logic is Aristotelian. [[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] ([[User talk:Rick Norwood|talk]]) 13:03, 28 May 2013 (UTC)
