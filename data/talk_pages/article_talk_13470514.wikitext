== Speedy deletion of &quot;Willowfield Parish Football Club&quot; ==

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A page you created, [[:Willowfield Parish Football Club]], has been tagged for [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion]], as it meets one or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]]; specifically, it is about a club or other organization, but it does not indicate how it is important or significant, and thus why it should be included in an encyclopedia. Please see the guidelines for what is [[Wikipedia:Notability|generally accepted as notable]], and the [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|guidelines for organizations]] in particular.

You are welcome to contribute content which complies with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies#Content and Style|content policies]] and any applicable [[Wikipedia:Notability|inclusion guidelines]]. However, please do not simply re-create the page with the same content.
