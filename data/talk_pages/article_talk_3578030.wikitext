== Replaceable fair use Image:1937 1107 kkat brick 500.jpg ==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|32px|left|Replaceable fair use]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:1937 1107 kkat brick 500.jpg]]'''. I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Fair use criteria|first fair use criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:Image:1937 1107 kkat brick 500.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to add {{tlx|di-replaceable fair use disputed}}, '''without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:1937 1107 kkat brick 500.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target={{PAGENAMEE}}&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if not used in an article), per our [[WP:FUC|Fair Use policy]].  If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:di-replaceable fair use-notice --&gt;

An image or media file that you uploaded or altered, [[:Image:1787 0529 monstrous 280.jpg]], has been listed at [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion]]. Please see the [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2008 June 29#Image:1787 0529 monstrous 280.jpg|discussion]] to see why this is (you may have to search for the title of the image to find its entry), if you are interested in it not being deleted. {{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}} [[User:Eubulides|Eubulides]] ([[User talk:Eubulides|talk]]) 07:57, 29 June 2008 (UTC) &lt;!-- Template:Idw --&gt; [[User:Eubulides|Eubulides]] ([[User talk:Eubulides|talk]]) 07:57, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:File:1868 0614 dickens 135.jpg]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:File:1868 0614 dickens 135.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#F9|section F9 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the image appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted images or text borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:File:1868 0614 dickens 135.jpg|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[File talk:1868 0614 dickens 135.jpg|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-dbimgcopyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Soundvisions1|Soundvisions1]] ([[User talk:Soundvisions1|talk]]) 20:27, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

==File permission problem with File:1844 cruikshank oliver twist.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:1844 cruikshank oliver twist.jpg]]'''. I noticed that while you provided a valid copyright licensing tag, there is no proof that the creator of the file agreed to license it under the given license. 

If you created this media entirely yourself but have previously published it elsewhere (especially online), please either 
* make a note permitting reuse under the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] or another acceptable free license (see [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags/Free licenses|this list]]) '''at the site of the original publication'''; or
* Send an email from an address associated with the original publication to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}''', stating your ownership of the material and your intention to publish it under a free license. You can find a sample permission letter [[WP:CONSENT|here]]. If you take this step, add {{tl|OTRS pending}} to the file description page to prevent premature deletion.

If you did not create it entirely yourself, please ask the person who created the file to take one of the two steps listed above, or if the owner of the file has already given their permission to you via email, please forward that email to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}'''. 

If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], use a tag such as {{tlp|non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags#Fair use]], and add a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|rationale]] justifying the file's use on the article or articles where it is included. See [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied, too. You can find a list of files you have created in [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Donihue}} your upload log]. '''Files lacking evidence of permission may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Files|criteria for speedy deletion]]. You may wish to read the Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:image use policy|image use policy]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-no permission-notice --&gt; [[User:Cloudbound|Cloudbound]] ([[User talk:Cloudbound|talk]]) 20:46, 15 April 2012 (UTC)
