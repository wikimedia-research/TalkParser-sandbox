== Light Industry ==

Should the article include industrial employers? There was a car antenna factory which was a local landmark (during the 70s and 80s commuters on the district line trains traveling at roof height could identify the factory by the car &quot;parked&quot; on its roof).

== Website addition ==

Hello,

I would like to add the following website to this link. Admittedly I am involved with this site so do appreciate the Wiki policy regarding getting other views before this is added.

The website provides additional information about areas above what the Wiki Page can provide (e.g. environemnt, greenspace, schools, etc) It also has additional search functionality.

I would welcome wider views on if this website is appropriate for inclusion.

That is a Times Online source. Could someone please eMail me the content of that? I'd like to write an article on [[Putney High Street]].--&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold&quot;&gt;[[User:Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;Laun&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;chba&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;ller&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:29, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
:{{done}}, but not a lot of help: it just says Putney High Street was fifth most &quot;anonymous&quot; (because full of branches of standard chains) out of 27 London high streets in a survey. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 15:31, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
::Agreed. I am amazed by the fact that it can't tell the difference between Wimbledon High Street and Wimbledon Broadway.--&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold&quot;&gt;[[User:Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;Laun&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;chba&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|&lt;font color=&quot;#00F&quot;&gt;ller&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:00, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

== Cokayne ==

[[George Cokayne]] has his own article which does not mention the spelling &quot;Cockayne&quot;. The fact that the incorrect spelling is more common does not mean it should supplant the correct one. He should really be linked in this and in the [[Wimbledon Common]] article.--[[User:Felix Folio Secundus|Felix Folio Secundus]] ([[User talk:Felix Folio Secundus|talk]]) 20:20, 23 December 2013 (UTC)
::You're absolutely right.  He should be linked.  Sorry I didn't notice that he had a Wikipedia article.  Will fix. —&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid black;margin-top:2px;bottom:2px;font- verdana;background:#09B9B9&quot;&gt;[[User:Wtwilson3|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bill&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User_talk:Wtwilson3|Talk]])&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Contributions/Wtwilson3|Contrib]])&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— 20:28, 23 December 2013 (UTC)
