Your recent edit to [[:Philippines]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philippines&amp;diff=132004509&amp;oldid=132002813 diff]) was reverted by an '''automated bot''' that attempts to recognize and repair [[Wikipedia:vandalism|vandalism]] to Wikipedia articles. If the bot reverted a legitimate edit, please accept my humble creator's apologies â€“ if you bring it to the attention of the bot's owner, we may be able to improve its behavior.
