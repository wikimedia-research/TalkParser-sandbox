Does not meet the [[GA criteria]]. This article is not only skinny as a start/stub, but it is not fully sourced (breaks #2; [[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)#Chart performance and sales|Chart performance and sales]], [[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)#Singles|Singles]], [[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)#Track listing|Track listing]]). Also does not match current layout guidelines in [[WikiProject Albums]].
