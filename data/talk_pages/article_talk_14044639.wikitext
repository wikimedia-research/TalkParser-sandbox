== Conflict of interest disclosure ==
I created this article, and I believe it's sufficiently notable etc etc.  However, I should disclose that I am an active user of this software and have made contributions to the code over time.  Just so there's no question about undisclosed conflict of interest.  [[User:Georgewilliamherbert|Georgewilliamherbert]] 00:47, 3 November 2007 (UTC)
