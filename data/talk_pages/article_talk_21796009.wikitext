==Speedy deletion of [[:Wr Nation]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Wr Nation]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G1|section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for any other experiments you would like to do. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Wr Nation|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:Wr Nation|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nonsense-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Belasd|Belasd]] ([[User talk:Belasd|talk]]) 23:17, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
