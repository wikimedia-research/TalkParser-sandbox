[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is your '''last warning'''. The next time you disrupt Wikipedia, as you did at [[:The Dating Guy]], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing without further notice'''. &lt;!-- Template:uw-generic4 --&gt; [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 17:23, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
:''If this is a [[closed proxy|shared IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''&lt;!-- Template:Shared IP advice --&gt;
