== Deletion discussion about [[PRECISACOL]] ==
Hello, Precisacol1988, 

I wanted to let you know that there's a discussion about whether PRECISACOL should be deleted. Your comments are welcome at  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PRECISACOL ]]. 

If you're new to the process, [[WP:AFD|articles for deletion]] is a group discussion (not a vote!) that usually lasts seven days. If you need it, there is a guide on [[WP:DISCUSSAFD|how to contribute]]. Last but not least, you are highly encouraged to continue improving the article; just be sure not to remove the tag about the deletion nomination from the top. 

Thanks, [[User:Travelbird|Travelbird]] ([[User talk:Travelbird|talk]]) 06:10, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

Because we have a [[Wikipedia:ORGNAME|policy]] against usernames that give the impression that the account represents a group, organization or website, I have [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] this account; '''please take a moment to [[Special:Userlogin/signup|create a new account]] with a username that represents only yourself as an individual and which complies with our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]].''' &amp;nbsp;You should also read our [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest guideline]] and be aware that promotional editing is not acceptable regardless of the username you choose. &lt;p&gt;If your username doesn't represent a group, organization or website, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this username block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|2=reason=''Your reason here &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''}} below this notice. If you prefer to be unblocked for the purpose of changing your username to a username which complies with our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]], so that your contributions with this username are recorded as contributions of your new username and rather than creating a new account, you may appeal this username block by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-un|2=''new username''|3=reason=''Your reason here &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''}} below this notice instead.&amp;nbsp;Thank you. -- [[User:Edgar181|Ed]] ([[User talk:Edgar181|Edgar181]]) 13:03, 30 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Uw-softerblock --&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z15}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-softerblock --&gt;

{{unblock-un reviewed | 1=anthonybridge | reason=precisacol is an account managed by one individual but for clarity's sake, I will change the username. Although the username states &quot;we&quot;, the we described refers to a group of people who are not aware of this page. For example, we as people understand what math is, but that doesn't mean that the one who made a wiki page on math speaks for every person who understands math. However, I agree on the matter of the article PRECISACOL, as new things are not meant to be posted without other resources confirming it. Therefore, if policy says so, I do not disagree on article deletion and will post the article again when other sources verify what has been said about the article. Precisacol1988 (talk) 8:54 am, Today (UTCâˆ’5) | accept=Allowing username change to requested username. Please put this request in at [[Wikipedia:Changing username]] as soon as possible to avoid re-blocking. -- [[User:Edgar181|Ed]] ([[User talk:Edgar181|Edgar181]]) 14:54, 30 November 2012 (UTC)}}
