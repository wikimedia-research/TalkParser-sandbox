[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Pinethicket|Pinethicket]]. I noticed that you recently removed some content from [[:Jewish population by country]]&amp;nbsp;without explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an accurate [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. If this was a mistake, don't worry; I restored the removed content. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[WP:Sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Pinethicket|my talk page]]. Thanks.&lt;!-- Template:uw-delete1 --&gt; [[User:Pinethicket|Pinethicket]] ([[User talk:Pinethicket|talk]]) 15:54, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:The 80s chick|The 80s chick]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one or more of [[Special:Contributions/103.231.162.35|your recent contributions]]&amp;nbsp;to [[:Mohabbatein]] because it did not appear constructive. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[WP:sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:The 80s chick|my talk page]]. Thanks.&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt; [[User:The 80s chick|AD]] ([[User talk:The 80s chick|talk]]) 22:25, 7 September 2015 (UTC)
