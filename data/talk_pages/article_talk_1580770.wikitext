== Electoral picture peculiarity ==

Why is the graphic depiction of electoral votes skewed? Rarely nowadays does one see democratic votes colored red and and republican votes blue. --[[User:Marudubshinki|maru]]  [[User talk:Marudubshinki|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki|Contribs]] 20:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== Eugene Debs ==

Why is there no mention of third party socialist candidate Eugene Debs?  I don't have enough expertise to update the article, but it seems like that should be adressed. -- [[User:66.193.73.85|66.193.73.85]] 18:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

This page is hard to get to. If I type in &quot;U.S. Presidential Election of 1912&quot;, no articles come up.
But if I type in the same thing in Google, then the article does come up. Which is good, but the same thing should happen in Wikipedia.

== Assassination attempt ==

:While campaigning in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], TR was shot by saloonkeeper [[John Schrank]] in a failed assassination attempt on [[October 14]], [[1912]]. With the bullet lodged in his chest, Roosevelt delivered his scheduled speech. He was not seriously wounded (the bullet's progress was slowed by hitting a copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket), although his doctors thought it too dangerous to attempt to remove the bullet; Roosevelt carried it with him until he died.
This should be in the main text, but I'm not sure where to put it.  Any thoughts? [[User:Calbaer|Calbaer]] 16:30, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

== Incorrect Popular Vote % for Wilson ==

The popular vote totals are listed accurately at both the header graphic and table and the more complete table, but the % for candidate Wilson is improperly listed as 31.8%, when it was in the low 40's.   &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.194.72.10|66.194.72.10]] ([[User talk:66.194.72.10|talk]]) 23:36, 17 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Richard M. Johnson==
Aricle says Sherman was the first VP to be renominated (for reelection) since Richard M. Johnson (in 1840). However, Johnson wasn't renominated, the Democrats in 1840 left their vice presidential nomination vacant. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 19:09, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

== International Harvester ==

I have converted the text &quot;International Harvester&quot; into a link to the article about that corporation, but I find nothing there supporting assertions made in this article. Somebody should check.

== Not the only election... ==

Why does this page say that this is &quot;the only election between 1892 and 1932 in which a Democrat was elected President&quot;?  Wasn't Wilson still a Democrat when he was re-elected in 1916?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.213.222.13|76.213.222.13]] ([[User talk:76.213.222.13|talk]]) 04:34, 21 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Debs ==

Does anyone have any issue adding Debs? He finished with 6% of the vote, enough to warrant addition to the template. Also, he gained more votes in some states (California, Arizona) than the GOP candidate.

== What If? ==
Right now, the article says this: &quot;...Roosevelt was to the left of Wilson on many issues; had Roosevelt not been in the race, it is doubtful that Wilson would have defeated Taft. Many Roosevelt supporters undoubtedly would have preferred Taft to Wilson.&quot;
I have three problems with this:
1) It's pure opinion.
2) There's no source, no citation, no facts, no polling, no studies, and NOTHING else to back it up. If you feel that way, fine. But tell us WHAT led you to this conclusion.
3) It doesn't even make sense. If Roosevelt is to Wilson's left, and Roosevelt wasn't in the race, why would Roosevelt's liberal supporters leapfrog over Wilson and support Taft, the most conservative person in the race?

:Hi, new questions/comments here are best added to the bottom of the page.

:i thought the same thing when i cam across this paragraph, something doesn't smell right about it. There are also a few other comments in the text which betray a bias against Roosevelt, calling his entry into the election a &quot;vendetta&quot; against Taft as well.
:The begining of chapter 10 (pg189) of Colonel Roosevelt by Edmund Morris says 

:::&quot; Ideologically there was less difference between Wilson and Roosevelt than between any of the republican candidates. The governors success in bestowing a raft of progressive reforms upon NJ had helped Roosevelt to his big win there&gt; But it also bolstered Wilson's own campaign for Dem nomination.&quot;  
:That paragraph certinally contradicts the idea of Taft picking up Roosevelts votes.

== Was Taft on the ballot in California?==
He came in fifth there, the worst showing of any president in history. Were these write-ins?[[User:Ericl|Ericl]] ([[User talk:Ericl|talk]]) 15:25, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

== Candidate Colors in Info Box ==
Does anyone know how to change the colors of the thin bars below the candidates' portraits at the top-right corner of the article? The red and orange for Taft and Debs look too similar to my eyes (I thought they were of the same party at first). I think the graphic would benefit from a starker difference—perhaps the introduction of magenta or yellow? Thank you.

:Never mind, I've now changed the color. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bbcc99;&quot;&gt;[[User:Startswithj|startswithj]] ([[User talk:Startswithj|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 18:50, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

== Why is Eugene Debs picture shown?  ==

In all other races only candidates getting electoral votes are shown.  That seems like an impartial and logical cut off.  If not that, then why Debs at 6$ an not Ed Clarke in 1980 at 1%?   Seems like NPV is being violated in favor of the Socialist candidate, who is made to appear more significant than he was.

:He is pictured because he received 5% or more of the popular vote, which is a standard for inclusion as it widely used by political scientists and analysts as a benchmark of &quot;success&quot; for minor party or independent candidates.--[[User:JayJasper|JayJasper]] ([[User talk:JayJasper|talk]]) 18:56, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

==Why doesn't Debs appear on the county maps?==
There were several counties won by Debs in some states, and the county maps in the middle of the article used to show Wilson in blue, Roosevelt in green, Taft in red, and Debs in Yellow.  At some point though, someone replaced the maps which the current ones which feature Wilson in blue, Taft in red, and all other candidates combined in green.  In most cases this is Roosevelt, and this corresponds to the color code of the rest of the article, but for several counties another candidate outpolled Debs and Roosevelt combined (thus, the &quot;Other&quot; votes), or the county should be shown as having voted for Debs.
