I've said he died on the 27th of February, though the BBC page doesn't state. It's unlikely they found out and published the story  within 50 minutes of his death though, so it's probably not the 28th as the page originally stated. I'm sure further details will appear in later. [[User:EAi|EAi]] ([[User talk:EAi|talk]]) 02:31, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

The obit that appeared in The Guardian http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/mar/02/geoffrey-smith-obituary agrees with you.[[User:MidlandLinda|MidlandLinda]] ([[User talk:MidlandLinda|talk]]) 17:30, 14 January 2010 (UTC)
