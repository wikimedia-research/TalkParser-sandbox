== Deletion ==

I am annoyed that a number of people's contributions to the SkyTran and then Unimodal pages seem to have been deleted without a trace -- SkyTran gave only a cryptic delete notice that didn't link to any details, and Unimodal (where SkyTran had been moved) now only links to the alternate disambiguation of unimodal function.  I believe strongly that SkyTran is one of the most positive technical developments in today's world -- not only is it '''200 MPG''', but it solves the problem of urban transportation congestion (and thus encourages planet-friendly dense cities) better than any other I am aware of.  Global warming and all the misery caused already fighting over increasingly-scarce oil make these attributes we cannot dismiss lightly.  

SkyTran is also not a frivolous or amateur affair.  Its inventor [[Douglas Malewicki]] is very well qualified to design highly efficient small vehicles: he has a Aeronautical Engineering MS from Stanford; his previous inventions include human-powered vehicles &lt;ref&gt;Gross, AC, Kyle CR, and Malewicki DJ. The aerodynamics of human-powered land vehicles. Sci Am 249: 142-152, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;, two Guinness world records for fuel-efficient &quot;California Commuter&quot; cars (ca. 155 MPG gas and diesel), light aircraft for Cessna, and many more.  See his [[http://www.carbonangel.org/julieta/advisory_duglas_malewicki.html board member bio at CarbonAngel] for these and many more examples.  Doug applied for his first patent on SkyTran 18 years ago; he has spent almost two decades fighting to get it accepted; the world does not have a surplus of such people and achievements.  

Finally, what are the transportation design qualifications of the people arbitrarily deleting this material?  It's true that [http://www.skytran.net his original, detail-packed web page] has been temporarily password-protected (probably for commercial reasons), but [http://www.unimodal.com his company Unimodal]'s is still up and gives the basics.  I have put a number of external references into this version; so no one can say it is unverifiable.  A quick Google will provide many more examples -- this invention is real, and it's finally getting traction.  Please respect a brilliant inventor and a tremendously promising system; add to this article whatever positive or negative points you can document, but please don't delete it again.  (A technical point: SkyTran is the invention; Unimodal is the company; each should have a page -- combining them makes as much sense as moving all the MS Windows pages to a Microsoft article.)

'''Current Status of SkyTran''' [http://web.archive.org/web/20051108171517/http://www.skytran.net/04Technical/pod14.htm]

''&quot;Aaaarrrrgghh! Ain't no such animal - yet. It is still just a concept that makes a lot of theoretical sense. It needs money to tear into it properly - a lot.

''Why it hasn't happened yet is mostly my fault. I detest paperwork and details. I can't see myself applying for any government energy or innovation grants because of all the bureaucratic crap that I would be stuck with. If they supplied paperwork bozos along with the grants to take care of their required paperwork, it might be more appealing. I guess I also don't want to deal with all their other silly rules either. If I want to hire all black engineers (and I know a bunch of dam good practical ones), to the exclusion of Hispanics, Women, Polaks, etc. the government won't let me. I start reading the grant application forms and rules and never finish - because I toss it all in the garbage first in disgust. Basically, I'm selfish. I prefer to think and create. I have plenty of other non-hassle projects I can be involved in to feed my brain endorphins or whatever. I am definitely not the right kind of personality to carry this project to fruition in the real world!&quot;

== New quote is undue weight ==

An unflattering quote from an old (archived) blog entry of Malewicki has been added to the article. I believe this creates WP:WEIGHT issues for a small article such as this. If we are going to include an offhand quote (obviously made in frustration) from his private website, we should also include his designs, which were also documented on his site. Those designs have been previously pared down to nothing because they were considered unreliable, but if we can include that quote, we should also include his designs (with qualifications, of course, to indicate that they are untested)

So I suggest we either (a) restore the technical details that were removed or (b) remove the quote. [[User:ATren|ATren]] ([[User talk:ATren|talk]]) 01:50, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

:Agreed! [[User:Skybum|Skybum]] ([[User talk:Skybum|talk]]) 10:10, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

== SkyTran in San Francisco? ==

I'm sure Skytran's elevated guideways and thousands of stations would be a welcome replacement for all those hideous cable cars - [http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~frencheneesz/Skytran%20report.htm]...[[User:Avidor|Avidor]] ([[User talk:Avidor|talk]]) 02:00, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

:This has nothing to do with the article, which doesn't even mention San Francisco. So why are you quoting it here? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the author is Fresheneesz? It is inappropriate to post comments that are only intended to incide another editor.

::::More information and discussion is a good thing. Do you think Skytran  is appropriate for San Francisco? Do you a city-wide system using elevated guideways and hundreds, perhaps thousands of stations would be welcome in San Francisco?

:::::::* San Francisco is 48 square miles. This translates to 96 miles of track spaced at 1 mile. Since portals are supposed to be 1 mile apart.. this makes for 96 portals - not thousands.

:::::No, this forum is for discussion of the article. ''San Francisco is not in the article - never has been''. Now, please explain to me the relevance of discussing ''this particular'' analysis, other than the fact that it was authored by Fresheneesz.

I didn't mention the author... and since this essay is compelling and relevant for many reasons. One reason in particular is that many cities have regulations against [[Visual pollution]]. It's difficult for me to imagine that Skytran (or any transportation system with an elevated guideway) could be built in a historic or scenic area... but, perhaps I'm wrong... I think the issue of visual pollution of elevated guideways should be mentioned in the article... wht do you think?...[[User:Avidor|Avidor]] ([[User talk:Avidor|talk]]) 15:42, 18 May 2008 (UTC)
:I repeat: the essay is not mentioned whatsoever in the article, and unless you are advocating adding it to the article, it's irrelevant. Also, this is not the place to debate PRT or SkyTran - this page is for discussing the SkyTran ''article''. If you really want a debate, I seem to recall someone openly challenging you to a PRT debate, someone who runs a blog... oh wait, that was me! :-) So if you wish to debate the merits of PRT with me, browse on over to my blog and answer my many-months-old open challenge, and we can find an appropriate forum.

== Skytran Critics? ==

Who are the &quot;critics&quot; of Skytran cited [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-03-09/news/traffic-thicket/1 in this article?] Do they include the inventor?&quot; '''&quot;We're not real, yet,&quot; Malewicki admits.&quot;'''-- Are there any other critics of Skytran? Here's one; [http://laurelsandlances.blogspot.com/2007/08/untested-and-unproven-you-just-have-to.html]

Maybe it would be more accurate to say &quot;public officials&quot;, &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;transportation professionals&quot;... Quote from Arizona Republic article-[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/0802skytran0802.html]; '''&quot;Kyle Jones, chairman of the City Council's transportation and infrastructure committee, said the idea is more &quot;pipe dream&quot; than reality.&quot;'''... here's another from the same article; '''&quot;Mike James, Mesa's senior transportation planner, said SkyTran &quot;is an idea on the Internet, but that's about the only place it exists.&quot;
&quot;'''


== Skytran Proponents ==

Skytran is proposed mainly by people opposed to public spending on transit [http://www.marinij.com/editorial/ci_7681004][[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-03-09/news/traffic-thicket/1][http://www.novatoadvance.com/articles/2007/11/21/news/doc4744a3cc2fe67169517304.txt]

== The quote is inappropriate for this article. ==

It is highly inappropriate to include this one single quote about Malewicki, an isolated quote from five years ago that never received a bit of attention until long after it was removed from his site (and is only receiving attention now because one of his ideological enemies dug it up on a web archive - who also happens to be the editor trying to add it here). We say almost nothing about Malewicki in this article, and I believe it is a violation of both WP:WEIGHT and WP:BLP to include such a non-notable quote here. Avidor, if you continue to revert, I will raise this at BLP noticeboard. [[User:ATren|ATren]] ([[User talk:ATren|talk]]) 22:55, 19 May 2008 (UTC)


== Skytran Inventor's Quote Very Appropriate for this Article ==

Is  Malwicki the inventor of Skytran? If he has doubts about his own concept, that should be in the article. Another Malewicki quote: '''&quot;We're not real, yet,&quot; Malewicki admits.&quot;'''[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-03-09/news/traffic-thicket/1]...   [[User:Avidor|Avidor]] ([[User talk:Avidor|talk]]) 23:38, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

You have once again added that unflattering quote. It is not appropriate per BLP or WEIGHT. Please don't add it without further discussion.

As for the ''editorial'' you quote above, we might discuss adding opinion to the article, but then of course there is the NY Times piece which is very complimentary of Malewicki. I think adding a bunch of competing opinions on Malewicki is counterproductive, since this is about SkyTran, not Malewicki. But this is a separate issue from the archived, isolated 5-year-old quote from his website that has been long since removed. [[User:ATren|ATren]] ([[User talk:ATren|talk]]) 23:40, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

:: Blogs are not reliable sources, although the article which says ''&quot;We're not real, yet,&quot; Malewicki admits'' (which is obvious from the article already) also says: ''his résumé reveals more serious educational and professional qualifications, including a master's degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Stanford University''.

{{cquote|In short, I believe this quote is highly inappropriate per BLP. We say almost nothing about Malewicki anywhere on Wiki, he has no article of his own,Correction: he does have a small stub article, see below no reliable source ever reported the quote, and the SkyTran article itself is practically a stub so that this quote would make up half the article. Malewicki may be a bit of an eccentric, but he has a long list of inventions and is, on balance, a respected figure. To include this one inflammatory quote in isolation is inappropriate; to include more would also be inappropriate since Malewicki is frankly not very notable}}

== This article requires reliable sources that actually discuss the subject. ==

I've removed several assertions from the article that rest either on unreliable sources, such as a PowerPoint presentation hosted at &quot;SolarEVolution.com,&quot; and statements that are apparently extrapolations from an article about the Inductrack system which doesn't even mention SkyTran at all.  All information included in this article needs to come from a reliable source which explicitly mentions SkyTran.  Because SkyTran is entirely theoretical, it is critical that the sources are trustworthy and relevant.

:I seem to remember there being more sources for this topic. Not a whole lot, but more than we have now. But I can't find them anymore. It may have been that some of the claims were sourced to the SkyTran website itself, which now seems to have removed most of those details. I'll keep looking.

:: Why exactly is the PowerPoint from SolarEVolution.com unreliable? Information based on Inductrack is NOT an extrapolation. Inductrack is a technology meant to be used in SkyTran, and thus its benefits, drawbacks, and other qualities are part of SkyTran as well. I don't see what the problem is with citing information about Inductrack where it is relevant to SkyTran. Lets discuss this before the article is changed. [[User:Fresheneesz|Fresheneesz]] ([[User talk:Fresheneesz|talk]]) 22:44, 11 June 2008 (UTC)
:::The article about Inductrack doesn't mention SkyTran at all.  The system they were testing looks nothing whatsoever like the schematics of the SkyTran system, which means anything the article says about the Inductrack test track has no bearing on this article unless it directly, explicitly mentions SkyTran.  Meanwhile, the Transportation category was removed because, being listed as a vehicle, a green vehicle, and other categories, it's already automatically in the &quot;Transportation&quot; sub-category, which means it's redundant to have the &quot;Transportation&quot; tag.  Please produce references that explicitly state that '''SkyTran''' will have the design features you are saying it will before reinserting that content.

:::: I did. That powerpoint you removed. What about it is &quot;unreliable&quot; exactly? Also, it doesn't make sense that SkyTran would *not* have core design &quot;features&quot; like a liftoff speed. Those things that are inherent in the physics of Inductrack would be in Skytran's design. Its stupid to require that SkyTran be mentioned in an article when Skytran uses that technology. SkyTran is not proposing creating new technology that is like inductrack - it is 100% using the inductrack technology. Why don't you try to look for these sources you want yourself? Please lets come to a concensus before you change the article. [[User:Fresheneesz|Fresheneesz]] ([[User talk:Fresheneesz|talk]]) ([[User talk:68.6.120.133|talk]]) 19:06, 12 June 2008 (UTC)
:::::I've been looking for reliable sources, but have run into the same challenges others are seeming to have in tracking them down. Are you saying that, hypothetically, any PowerPoint found hosted somewhere on the internet, purporting to detail how SkyTran works, is reliable enough to include in this article as a reputable source?  That seems problematic to me.  That would mean that if Avidor, who above and elsewhere has made his dislike for PRT clearly known, were to post a PowerPoint saying whatever he pleased about SkyTran, that information should also be included in the article.
:::::I would hope we can agree that the article about Inductrack doesn't mention SkyTran at all.  That means that any specifics about takeoff speeds, distances traveled, power needed for liftoff, etc., are referring to [https://www.llnl.gov/str/October04/gifs/Post1.jpg this vehicle], the Inductrack prototype, and not [[:Image:SkyTran_Seattle2.jpg|this vehicle]], the SkyTran design concept. I removed the source you added for the grid of tracks, as it isn't a reliable source -- it's a conference agenda blurb.  There's absolutely no way of determining who wrote that, when, based on what evidence, if any.  This may be a bit of text straight from Unimodal, but we can't even use it as such in the article and list is as a quotation, because we simply don't know its source.  (Compare the verifiability of that conference agenda to the Inductrack paper which is hosted by a reputable government agency and is part of a specific, dated periodical, provides extended, technical explanations, and credits the author, with multiple forms of contact listed.)  Again, this article requires iron-clad, reliable sources.  Otherwise, snippets of rumor can become like barnacles in articles like this, until finally the article may become more hypothesis than fact.

:::::::The issue with the PowerPoint is two-fold: first, I'm trying to figure out exactly what SolarEVolution.com is -- is it an advocacy site?  It seems to be a collection of links, but I can't quite determine what the purpose of the organization is, so it's tough to know what we're looking at.  The PowerPoint seems to be straight from UniModal, complete with invisible-to-the-audience notes about how to make a strong case for SkyTran -- but it doesn't say who made it, and even if we ''knew'' it was from UniModal, it's not an independent, third-party source.  It does strongly hint that such content may exist somewhere, though.  Thanks for being patient with ''me'' and the fact-finding process.  It's really frustrating, I know, to personally know a thing is likely true, but not be able to find supporting evidence for it for an article.  But reliable sources will turn up, and then the article will be both reliable ''and'' thorough in its coverage.

== Israeli blog asserts specific route and schedule in Tel Aviv ==

Following the announcement late in 2013 by the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality that JGM Civil Engineers would be providing planning, civil engineering, and construction management for the Tel Aviv automated transit network (ATN) system:
http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/eng/Pages/Item.aspx?List={4FE3C3A4-0379-47BE-B94A-78707EF750C1}&amp;ID=98
the Israeli Innovation News blog NoCamels reports on 14 April 2014:
&quot;At an estimated cost of $50 million, the four-mile route, to be constructed during the coming year, will connect the Tel Aviv University train station with the nearby Atidim high-tech park and take about 18 months to construct. Further north, the coastal city of Netanya is also considering the construction of a SkyTran system.&quot;
http://nocamels.com/2014/04/top-10-futuristic-technologies-made-in-israel/
I'll let you guys sort out whether you think this is relevant. $50 million dollars funding is not politically impossible as a target. Jenkins Gales and Martinez seems to have 50 to 100 employees.
http://start.cortera.com/company/research/k3m5lsk5n/jenkins-gales--martinez-inc/
Presumably the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality website is a reliable source. Appointing a contract would seem to be significant as an indicator of something.

== Contradiction re Tel Aviv ==

Intro states that building work not seen in Tel Aviv, but further down it states that only a test track away from public view is planned.  According to some of the info on this talk page, it states that a route would go in public areas.... Clarity would be nice!
