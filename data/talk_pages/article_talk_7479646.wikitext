While it might seem reasonable to assume that such files can be freely used on Wikipedia, a non-profit website, [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html this is in fact '''not''' the case]. Please do not upload any more files with these restrictions on them, because content on Wikipedia needs to be compatible with the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], which allows anyone to use it for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial.

'''If you ''created'' this media file''' and want to use it on Wikipedia, you may re-upload it, but use the license &lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to license it under the [[GFDL]], or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cc-by-sa-2.5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to license it under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike license, or use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to release it into the public domain.

'''If you ''did not create'' this media file''' but want to use it on Wikipedia, there are two ways to proceed.  First, you may choose one of the fair use tags from [[Wikipedia:Fair Use#Tagging fair use images|this list]] if you believe one of those [[fair use]] rationales applies to this file.  Second, you may want to contact the copyright holder and [[Wikipedia:Example requests for permission|request that they make the media available under a '''free''' license]].

If you have any questions please ask at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. Thank you. {{{2|[[User:24.20.69.240|24.20.69.240]] 03:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)}}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Idw-noncom --&gt;
