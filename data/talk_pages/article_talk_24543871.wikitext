== Congratulations ==
Congratulations on making it to today's listing on the &quot;Did You Know...&quot; section of Wikipedia Main Page.  The process of making it the listing takes a bit of effort and involves the quick cooperation of many editors.  All involved deserve recognition, appreciation, thanks and applause. And besides that I'm from Michigan and no that's pretty special.
:Best Regards,
