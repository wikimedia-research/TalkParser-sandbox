The tomb of Antoni Cierplikowski was destroyed in 2004, including the statue by [[Xawery Dunikowski|Dunikowski]] ([http://www.panoramio.com/photo/17483956 The soul leaving the body])&lt;ref&gt;Beyern, B., ''Guide des tombes d'hommes célèbres'', Le Cherche Midi, 2008, 377p, ISBN 978-2749113500&lt;/ref&gt;. The grave is sometimes still shown on maps, sometimes as Antoine or Corplikowski, on the (old) official cemetery map, the grave is located in division 9, number 75. Antoni Cierplikowski is buried in [[Sieradz#Famous people of Sieradz|Sieradz]]. Cierplikowski was known in Paris as ''Monsieur Antoine''. He was a noted international hairstylist. The grave in Passy was a ceremonial grave, designed by himself, containing his right hand (in a box). [[User:JHvW|JHvW]] ([[User talk:JHvW|talk]]) 22:25, 23 October 2009 (UTC)

The cemetery also lists [[Annabella]] as one of the residents. It is also what is listed in her article. But I have been informed that she is actually interred in [[Passy, Haute-Savoie]].
