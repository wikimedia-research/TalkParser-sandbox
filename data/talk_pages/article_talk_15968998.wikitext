==Use of Wikipedia==
Currently within Wikipedia I have worked on performing minor edits to a page titled Jewish Enlightenment, and I have yet to perform and edit on a second article for my multimedia writing English course. Also for this same course a group of my peers and myself are writing a page. Though currently under work it will be finished within the next week or so. --[[User:Trumper1824|Trumper1824]] ([[User talk:Trumper1824#top|talk]]) 18:42, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
