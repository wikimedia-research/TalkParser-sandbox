==Misc. old comments (2002 through 2012)==
Does anyone know if amino acids as a vitamin aids in sleep???? That's what I was told.

Some moron added a load of grammatically incorrect and confusing content. I would revert, but there have been several edits since then and no one has fixed it for some reason. Also, the information may be helpful but it has also not been verified. The single WHO citation is incorrect. I have added template messages to the article. Please explain before removing them if necessary.

'''Use of Amino Acids as nutritional supplement?''' I was looking around the amino acids page for information on this topic, but could not find it.  Amino Acid liquid supplements are sold at GNC and other health food outlets for use by athletes, body builders, calorie restrictive dieters, and other health conscious people.  Could someone who is knowledgeable about the pros and cons of using these supplements please post something about it?  --[[User:Alecke1|Alecke1]] 01:31, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

This comment doesn't belong on the main page, but...

One irony in Sheri Tepper's science fiction novel ''Grass'' (in my opinion, an otherwise excellent work) is that in her world, people suffer from a terrible deficiency disease which affects [[alanine]]. As stated previously, [[alanine]] is not essential and can be synthesized from [[pyruvate]]. [[User:dwmyers|David M]]
: Of course, if one mentally substitutes phenylalanine for alanine, then at least it becomes plausible, which begs the question of which editor missed this gaffe as well. [[User:Dwmyers| David M]]

The standing issue I haven't been able to resolve to my satisfaction is the nature of arginine biosynthesis in humans. [[arginine]] can be synthesized from either [[ornithine]] or [[citrulline]] via the [[urea cycle]], which of course begs the question of whether in humans, this is a closed system or open. In other words, can carbon equivalents be fed into this cycle or does it require a source of one of these three amino acids? I know that in some bacteria there are precursers to ornithine because of constant net-references to genetic knock out studies. But does this precurser -&gt; ornithine biosynthetic pathway exist in humans? This I haven't found out yet. Dated Oct 11, 2002. [[User:dwmyers| David M]]

== Is Taurine essential ? (to humans) ==

Can anybody shed any light on whether Taurine is essential to humans. Is it synthesised in humans? or is our ability to synthesis it related to age?
:Well we need it, but it can be synthesised by us to a certain extent.
:''Is taurine essential?

:''Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid in adult humans; it is an essential amino acid for infants (mother's milk contains taurine). Gaull [1982, p. 90] discusses the need for taurine:
:''The finding of a dietary requirement for taurine in the human infant is consistent with the negligible activity of cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase present both in fetal and in mature human liver (4)...''
:''In adult man only 1% of an oral load of L-cysteine was recovered as increased urinary excretion of taurine, giving further evidence that mature human beings also have a relatively limited ability to synthesize taurine and may be largely dependant on dietary taurine (22). The rat, in striking contrast, has considerable ability to convert dietary cysteine to taurine (17).
:''See also Gaull [1977] as cited in Gaull [1982, 1986] for more information on taurine synthesis in humans vs. other animals.''

== arginine biosynthesis + mnemnonic ==

ornithine biosythnesis in mammals competes with proline biosynthesis

alpha keto glutarate + NH4+ --&gt; glutamate --&gt; gamma glutamyl phosphate --&gt; glutamyl semialdehyde --&gt; ornithine

(comapared to
alpha keto glutarate + NH4+ --&gt; glutamate --&gt; gamma glutamyl phosphate --&gt; glutamyl semialdehyde --[non enzymatic schiff base formation]--&gt; delta- pyrroline 5 carboxylate --&gt; proline + CO2

in plants, you add an acetyl blocking group to avoid competition with proline

conclusion; ornithine, and therefore arginine can be biosynthesized from scratch. the only problem is that infants have trouble synthesizing enough... so for kids, arginine is essential amino acid


i'd like to take up a complaint with the mnemnonic provided... its too misleading; a better one would have to based on the official amino acid single letter designation i.e.

MLKR HIV WTF

ya. thats lame, i know... but it will get me through my biochem final next week

my point is, find a better mnemnonic... using simply the first letter of each amino acid is too confusing... there are many amino acids beginning with the same letter

== Limiting amino acid ==

Why is the limiting amino acid the essential acid whose concentration is lowest, instead of the essential amino acid whose concentration divided by the recommended daily intake is lowest? Applying the latter criterion seems to always make methionine the limiting amino acid. [[User:Icek|Icek]] 21:46, 27 April 2007 (UTC)


The article suggests that it is necessary to eat complementary proteins, else the limiting amino acid will force the remaining protein to be &quot;wasted&quot;.  This is still true, however, there is plenty&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;[?]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of research today that says complementary proteins consumed within day's&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;[?!?]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; time of each other is sufficient; it does not have to be the same meal.

Yes, the concept seems to have been misunderstood: the limiting amino acid is the one without which the other amino acids are useless for protein synthesis. I.e. if you need ten Mols of lysine to make a protein that contains 5 Mols of Arg, 6 Mols of Met and 11 Mols of Tyr, then having tons of the other aminoacids still doesn't allow you to make more than two Mols of the protein, if you only have 20 Mols of lysine.

The [[amino acid]] article says there are 10 essential amino acids.  The Essential Amino Acid article (this one) starts by saying there are 9, but it contains a table that lists 10.

:The [[amino acid]] article now says 8. Here said 9. But the mnemonics help one to remember 10.
As 8 had multiple citations in the amino acid article i have changed this article to say 8. But this now disagrees with the WHO article. 
:Maybe histidine has changed? Is now essential instead of conditionally? Either way, this article should mention the discrepancies, as some of the references will disagree. I'm inclined to believe the scientific papers rather than the WHO article, as it's less likely to be politically biased. But without further reliable sources, i don't see how we can decide either way.[[User:Yobmod|Yobmod]] ([[User talk:Yobmod|talk]]) 13:48, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

===Use of essential amino acids===


----
I wrote (many years ago) an early version of the first and third paragraphs of the limiting amino acid/net protein utilization section. The discussion derives directly from lecture notes given by Professor James Walker of Rice University in the spring of 1981, and also from the textbook of McGilvery (ISBN 0-7216-5912-8), in particular chapter 41. Now that second paragraph is nothing I recall or would entirely agree with, but I admit to being a hard core [[carnivore]]. [[User:Dwmyers|Dwmyers]] 23:54, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

== Scope of article — '''not''' just humans ??==

The article lede currently says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''An '''essential amino acid''' or '''indispensable amino acid''' is an [[amino acid]] that cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by the organism '''(usually referring to humans)''' (emphasis added), and therefore must be supplied in the diet.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This part about humans is incorrect.  The essential/nonessential dichotomy is relevant to large numbers of non-human animals as well.  See for example the description of plant-sucking insects at [[Plant sap#Phloem sap]] for a well-sourced description on how essential/nonessential amino acids are used in the insect order Hemiptera, true bugs, who definitely need essential amino acids, as do humans also.

But the scope of the article ought not to restrict to humans, especially in the lede.[[User:N2e|N2e]] ([[User talk:N2e|talk]]) 21:45, 4 May 2013 (UTC)

:&lt;b&gt;The article is about humans w/ non-human aspects randomly tossed in&lt;/b&gt;.  Further, it is a very safe guess that the bulk of the audience is looking for information to replace (potentially) dangerous flesh sources with vegetable proteins, particularly from popular soy sources.  Mixing together different types of organisms is actually stupid because each organism's type of nutritional model is different making the article more than confusing; it makes it absurd.
