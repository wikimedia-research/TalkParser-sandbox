This text is a verbatim copy of a chapter in ''Ancient Egypt'' by George Rawlinson. Although the original text is not copyrighted, it is disrespectful not to mention where it is from. This is not an encyclopedia article, it has no introduction and starts in the middle of the story - should it get deleted? --[[Special:Contributions/78.54.20.144|78.54.20.144]] ([[User talk:78.54.20.144|talk]]) 20:24, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
:I'd say this is an important subject, but even if the article wasn't completely plagiarized it is utterly unencyclopedic. I say someone in the know should completely re-write it. [[User:Wormwoodpoppies|Wormwoodpoppies]] ([[User talk:Wormwoodpoppies|talk]]) 04:41, 15 November 2008 (UTC)
