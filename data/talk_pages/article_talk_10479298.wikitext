Other places give his year of death as 1349. What is the correct date? [[User:Fornadan|Fornadan]] [[User talk:Fornadan|(t)]] 09:03, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

In the 14th century the new year began in March - April, so his date of death would have been 1349 by 14th century reckoning, but 1350 by modern reckoning. [[User:Kissmaiden|Kissmaiden]] ([[User talk:Kissmaiden|talk]]) 00:02, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
