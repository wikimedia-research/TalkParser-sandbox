== The 'rudeness' of shifting the stress to the left ==

I've removed the following bit from the section on stress as it's way too specific and IMHO has little to do with phonology:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The stress is sometimes placed earlier in the word than it should be for emphasis{{cn|date=August 2015}} (this is considered rude) –
* {{IPA|/ˈɛla/}}('come here), instead of {{IPA|/ɛˈla/}}
* {{IPA|/ˈkaʒi/}} ('tell me'), instead of {{IPA|/kaˈʒi/}}
* {{IPA|/ˈɔstavi mɛ na mira/}} ('leave me alone'), instead of {{IPA|/ɔstaˈvi mɛ/}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This applies only to the imperative forms of verbs. Stressing these on the first syllable is a feature of western dialects and my gut feeling is that the 'rudeness', if any, comes from the stereotype about speakers of these dialects rather than from anything else. Any thoughts on that? [[User:Uanfala|Uanfala]] ([[User talk:Uanfala|talk]]) 21:29, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
: It can be considered rude to talk to somebody in dialect on purpose I guess, but I think you are right otherwise. --[[User:V111P|V111P]] ([[User talk:V111P|talk]]) 21:56, 26 August 2015 (UTC)
