[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello and welcome! I edit Wikipedia too, under the username [[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]]. Wikipedia is written by people like you and me, so thank you for taking the time to participate. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/121.219.173.191|your recent contributions]], such as the one you made to [[:School for Creative and Performing Arts]] with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_for_Creative_and_Performing_Arts?diff=463395919 this edit]&lt;/span&gt;, because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions about editing, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Jim1138|my talk page]]. Thanks! {{z85}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-huggle1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:uw-personal1 --&gt;[[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]] ([[User talk:Jim1138|talk]]) 01:37, 1 December 2011 (UTC)

&lt;div style=clear: both&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not add inappropriate [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Fettuccine alfredo]] with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine_alfredo?diff=463404064 this edit]&lt;/span&gt;. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]], nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites with which you are affiliated, and links that attract visitors to a web site or promote a product.  See [[Wikipedia:External links|the external links guideline]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam guideline]] for further explanations. Because Wikipedia uses the [[nofollow]] attribute value, its external links are disregarded by most search engines. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it. Thank you.[[Category:User talk pages with Uw-spam2 notices|{{PAGENAME}}]] &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-spam-2 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spam2 --&gt;[[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]] ([[User talk:Jim1138|talk]]) 02:08, 1 December 2011 (UTC)
