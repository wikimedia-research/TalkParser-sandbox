[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of [[Special:Contributions/Zzaibot2011|your recent edits]], such as the one you made to [[:Samurai]], did not appear to be constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]] or removed. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia.

[[File:Right-pointing hand in green octagon.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''[[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|Welcome to Wikipedia]]''' and thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Zzaibot2011|your contributions]]. However, I noticed that your username ''(Zzaibot2011)'' may not meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]]&amp;nbsp;because User name should not be ending with -bot.. If you believe that your username does not violate our policy, please leave a note here explaining why. As an alternative, you may ask for a [[Wikipedia:Changing username|change of username]], or you may simply create a new account to use for editing. Thank you.&lt;!-- THE FOLLOWING CATEGORY SHOULD BE REMOVED WHEN THE USER IS BLOCKED, OR IT IS DECIDED THE NAME DOES NOT APPEAR TO VIOLATE POLICY, OR THIS TEMPLATE HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE WITH NO ACTION:  --&gt; {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Zzaibot2011|}} &lt;!-- Template:uw-username --&gt;--[[User:Saddhiyama|Saddhiyama]] ([[User talk:Saddhiyama|talk]]) 10:07, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

You are encouraged to '''[[Special:Userlogin/signup|choose a new account name]]''' that meets our [[WP:U|policy]] guidelines. Alternatively, if you have already made edits and you wish to keep your [[Special:MyContributions|existing contributions]] under a new name, then you may request a '''[[WP:CHU|change in username]]''' by:

Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-un|''your new username here''}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]]. You should be able to do this even though you are blocked, as you can usually still edit your own talk page. If not, you may wish to contact the blocking administrator by clicking on &quot;E-mail this user&quot; on their talk page.
:# At an administrator's discretion, you may be unblocked for 24 hours to file a request.
:# Please note that you may only request a name that is not already in use, so please check [[Special:ListUsers|here]] for a listing of already taken names. The account is created upon acceptance, thus '''do not''' try to create the new account before making the request for a name change. For more information, please see [[Wikipedia:Changing username]].

If you feel that you were blocked in error, you may [[Wikipedia:AAB|appeal this block]] by adding below this notice the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area.
