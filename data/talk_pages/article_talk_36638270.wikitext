==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Anantpatil]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

A tag has been placed on [[:Anantpatil]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that the page was nominated in error, contest the nomination by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot; in the speedy deletion tag. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you can explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[Talk:Anantpatil|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but do not hesitate to add information that is consistent with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication of deleted content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Anbu121|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;'''Anbu121'''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User_talk:Anbu121|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''talk me'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]) 10:16, 5 August 2012 (UTC)

== Wikipedia is not for writing about yourself ==
Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia, but it is not a site like Myspace, Facebook or LinkedIn for people to write about themselves. It is a different sort of site, a project to build an [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]], so it is [[WP:N|selective]] about subjects for articles, and writing about oneself is ''strongly'' discouraged, for reasons explained at [[WP:Wikipedia is not about YOU|Wikipedia is not about YOU]] and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography]]. The links in the Welcome message at the top of this page will tell you more about Wikipedia. Regards, [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 10:31, 5 August 2012 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Anantpatil]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A2|section A2 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a foreign language article that was copied and pasted from another [[Wikimedia]] project at [[:mr:महानुभाव पंथ]]. Please see [[Wikipedia:Translation]] to learn about requests for, and coordination of, translations from [[m:List of Wikipedias|foreign-language Wikipedias]] into English.

*This was a copy of the Marathi Wikipedia article at [[:mr:महानुभाव पंथ]], but you cannot just copy and paste an article from another-language Wikipedia, because that does not give the necessary attribution to the authors of the source article. Also, this is the English-language Wikipedia, so contributions need to be in English. See [[Wikipedia:Translation]] for advice on what to do if you want to make this article available in English.

Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content.

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not write or add to an article about  yourself. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]] is ''strongly'' discouraged – see our guideline on [[WP:AUTOBIO|writing  autobiographies]]. If you create such an article, it may be deleted. If what you have done in life is genuinely notable and can be verified according to our policy for [[WP:PEOPLE|articles about living  people]], someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]]). If you wish to add to an existing article about yourself, please propose the changes on its talk page. Please understand that this is an encyclopedia and not a personal web space or social networking site. If your article has already been deleted, please see: [[Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?|Why was my page deleted?]], and if you feel the deletion was an error, please discuss it with the deleting administrator.
