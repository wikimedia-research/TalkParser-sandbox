The author of this article has apparently used only the older literature and completely neglected the most recent research by Christensen, Bierbrauer, Wolfram and others which show convincingly that the Goths originated from the Wielbark culture of northern Poland and that they did not come from Scandinavia. This view is also expressed in the authorative Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde. I think this article should be revised to reflect the latest and best founded view on the Goths and not the outdated scholarship.

:I am not the only author of this article. I have added quite little, and most of my edits consist of polishing. Moreoever, why do claim that it is outdated? Have you read this talk page? You'll find references to many modern scholars who disagree with you.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 15:51, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)



I don't see any consideration of the main scholarly work on the Goths in the article. Thus, the recent book by Arne Soeby Christensen, who shows that Jordanes' work cannot be used to postulate a Scandinavian origin of the Goths has not been mentioned. Also, leading scholars like H. Wolfram, A. Schwarcz, W. Pohl, V. Bierbrauer and others have clearly not been considered at all. The Wikipedia arcticle should refect the latest views as they can be found in key works on Germanic history such as the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde. In the present shape the article is misleading readers.

:The matter does not stand and fall with Jordanes. Moreover, instead of putting the burden of evidence of Jordanes, you could start to argue about the evidence against the Scandinavian origins of the Goths. That would be relevant.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 18:46, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Also, I find it disgraceful, how a well written and sound piece of work by a respectable scholar like Eric Anctil was attacked and denounced in this discussion.

I was wondering if anyone can help me to find the origin of the word Gothic when refering to the art of the time frame.  I am very interested in why they chose this word and was it associated the way that we think of the word today?

:I haven't read any recent expose, but from memory (and my own imagination I guess), there was a substantial pro-&quot;Goth&quot; romanticism in the Mediterranean area after the time of the fall of West Rome. This must have had some of its roots at least in a probably conscious propaganda. For instance the naturalized goth/roman Theoderic (&quot;the Great&quot;) had a Goth descendant (self-proclaimed at least) scribe, who did much to glorify the origin of T. (See Cassiodurus, Jordanes). The Gothic term may have had its original roots somewhere in that context, although it did not surface until much later - Charlemagne adored Theoderic and for instance had the equestrian statue of him (erected in Constantinople prior to T's leaving for the Italian campaign) brought all the way up to Aachen. Associating with the glorious, the brave etc etc Goths was important, evidently. After that time, the link from the Goths to Gothic may be easier to follow.
:But do keep in mind this is way off what I might claim to actually &quot;know&quot;. Otherwise I'd write it up in a neato article:-) Oh and I haven't even bothered to actually asearch the pedia before writing this... [[User:OlofE|OlofE]] 23:25 May 5, 2003 (UTC)

Also, re: etymology of Goth - There is a neck ring or arm ring found in the Ukraine or Belarus somewhere, dated at approx 200 AD and with a Gothic language inscription made with runes (it's one of only 3 or 4 such inscriptions). The text is along the lines of, &quot;Gauthi ring&quot;, interpreted as simply &quot;Our ring&quot;. I take this to indicate there is some agreement that the &quot;gaut-&quot; stem is used in the meaning of &quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, and that there may be a closer relationship between the tribes describing themselves with similar words - Jutes, Geats (Götar), Gutar (Gotland) and Goths. Of course, if those tribes once formed a greater body of people, other tribes probably also shared the same origin, only they took more imaginative new names for themselves:-) I'll get back in a while with sources for this (both the ring and the word), I'm kinda swamped right now.

Years went from 1 BCE to 1 CE, no? What is this reference to 0 CE in the article?

:An anonymous contributor wrote:
:&quot;The question of the origin of the Goths has been discussed for a long time. Modern scholarship mostly rejects the idea that the Goths originated in Scandinavia. The 6th century Getica, written by Jordanes on the basis of the now lost history of the Goths by Cassiodorus, envokes several origin options, including the Getae, the biblical Magog and the island of Scanza. These are, however, topoi of ancient historiography and they don't reflect a real authentic tradition.&quot;

:There are two problems with this text. Firstly, it uses words such as &quot;no longer accepted&quot; and &quot;rejects&quot;. This doesn't sound very NPOV in my mind. The little I know about Polish archaeology is that the Scandinavian origins are pretty uncontroversial in Poland.



-----
That is wrong I am afraid. Practically all Polish scholars advocate the long-accepted view that the Wielbark culture is an indigenous culture that emerged without any migration out of the so called Okciewie culture.

:So what is wrong with this article then:[[http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/gazociag/title5.htm]?--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 19:03, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Secondly, he pretends that the biblical Magog and the Getae are other &quot;origin options&quot;. This does not correspond to my reading of Jordanes. When '''I''' read him, he is quite clear on the Scandinavian origins of the Goths. This piece also sounds pretty suspect: &quot;they don't reflect a real authentic tradition.&quot; How can he '''know'''?

---------
The view that Jordanes presents several contradicting origin topoi has been argued by Profs. Wolfram, Goffart and by. A. Christensen. Your reading may be different, but this article should not reflect your opinion, but that of mainstream scholarship.

:Is there any proof that the Goths are the aboriginal population of the Vistula basin? Was the Vistula basin the cradle of the Germanic languages? Did the Goths come from Northern Germany?

I think your own theories are really not what matters for a Wikipedia article, but what matters are the theories established and discussed by the leading scholars in the field, and their views seem to be in stark contrast to yours. 

:Yes, they are, but they are also in stark contrast to other scholars.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 19:03, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)


:Any opinions? [[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]]

::I think those &quot;options&quot; should be sticken or moved to a discussion on the ''history of Gothic history'' - Jordanes is pretty clear on the topic (been a while since I read it but that's how I remember it). 

-----
You remember incorrectly. Please read a standard work on Gothic history such as H. Wolfram. 
----

The Getae link is based on a misunderstanding (I can't recall anyone debating this?) and should perhaps be explained. I don't see a problem with the phrases (&quot;no longer accepted&quot;, &quot;rejects&quot;) though, they are pretty accurate descriptions of contemporary views, are they not? What particular section is it that you object to?

::There isn't any claim that the Goths are the aboriginal population of the Vistula, is there... the text simply says that around that date, that's where we believe they were - before that, we don't know.

That is exactly correct!

:Yes, and that is not a theory. That is an earliest date.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 19:03, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Some sort of summary of archeological support (and lack thereof) for links between various regions and the Gothic culture should also be added to balance the linguistic part. So.... how about restructuring the &quot;Origins&quot; section into 
::* Historical accounts (Ambrose (377-378, Gog/Magog should be coming from the north and the Goths come ''ab extremo Aquilone'', from the exteme cold/North), Claudian (402, in saluting Stilicho, claims the Goths come from the snowy north), Cassius Dio, Jordanes (etc)
::* Archeological material - the first roman coin celebrating a victory against &quot;Goths&quot; (''Victoria Gothica'') was minted by emperor Claudius (268-270) (previous coins say ''Victoria Carpica'' or ''Victorica germanica'') - other archaelogical finds (inscriptions, burial patterns)
::** Modern conclusion from most importantly burial patterns and burial finds indicates a quite strong link between Geatish areas and the presumed Gothic culture in its progress southeastwards. It cannot be proved, but based on such finds one can speculate in long-term communication and cultural/economic exchange between the two areas
::* Linguistic connections (you know better than I how to summarize that)
::That would give a better (more balanced, IMO) picture of where current scholarship stands, do you agree?

::There may also be a case for a proper section on the history of Gothic heritage claims (esp. Spanish and Swedish history, as they are the most active). It's certainly interesting enough.

Yes, probably. However, my impression from talking with archaeologists and historians (I know a few) is that the Scandinavian origins of the Goths are not that controversial.

----
From a Symposium I attended two years ago, the impression is that Swedish scholars cling to that view, while everybody else has accepted that the Goths did not come from Scandinavia.

Exactly. So what is the point of disagreeing with Jordanes? He was in a better position to know, and refuting his theory should require some evidence. So far, I have seen no competing theory, and I have seen no evidence for any other background for the Goths. It seems like disagreeing with Jordanes is only a way of showing the scholar's analytic skills (which the anonymous contributor didn't do very well, did he?), without shedding any further light on the subject.

I agree with your suggestions. I will get back to contributing as soon as I have finished my Ph.D. [[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]]

I think it is paramount that the commentator above reads the recent substantial study by Arne Soeby Christensen on Jordanes. The work is based on the authors PhD thesis and presents a very thorough analysis of Jordanes. However, the general way of thinking that by blindly trusting the ancient authorls like Jordanes we are already a step closer to the truth is really really not acceptable and very misleading for any historian. Please read Christensen's recent book to get a very good perspective on that. alternatively you can consult R. Hachmann's book on the Goths and Scandinavia, which appeared already 30 years ago. 

:The article hardly quotes Jordanes as evidence.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 19:03, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

----
Jordanes states clearly that he did not have the work at hand - in the prologue of the Getica, he states that he has only had access to the original for 3 days but he is confident he can summarize it properly. He does not say when he had the original for reading though - it may have been last week or 10 years ago (from his time of writing) // [[User:OlofE|OlofE]] 22:51, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

OK, I'll insert it back then.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 05:12, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Correcting myself for the record - I (like Jordanes haha) don't have access to the book at the moment, but I meant the &quot;''dedication''&quot;, not &quot;prologue&quot;. It's in the part where he thanks his benefactor, right at the start of the book (so it is a prologue but I don't remember what Jordanes actually calls it). Nitpicking myself. I pondered for a bit if it might be the right decision to strike the passage in the article anyway - not because of the source situation but because it might be considered irrelevant. I can't offhand recall any encyclopedia or other source that mentions this circumstance. Perhaps that is a hint that it's not worth mentioning. // [[User:OlofE|OlofE]] 07:38, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
From Eric Anctil's ethnographic study of Scandinavia in Roman times:

&quot;His theory of the Goths having crossed the Baltic Sea from Sweden to northern Poland is flawed given that archaeology doesn't support his proposed migration route. Besides the fact that it was probably based on oral legends, too many generations had distorted the story and Jordanes himself was biased in trying to consolidate Roman historiography with Gothic history in order to advocate a fusion of cultures. Archaeological excavations in northern Poland were unable to find any similar characteristics that associated the two Northern European cultures except stone circle cemeteries that appear long after the initial appearance of the Goths in Roman sources during the first century CE. It would seem that this Gotho-Gepedian culture originated on the Continent and very likely exported their ritual methods across the Baltic to Sweden rather than the reverse since there is no physical evidence for movement across the Baltic during the first century BCE or CE(Heather 1996, 25-26).&quot;
[http://www.anctil.org/users/eric/hist413.html]

:Thanks for showing a piece of ''POV'' scholarship. His assertive statements, which are very disputable, remind me of ''pseudo-science'' and cast doubts on his scholarship. Now, it is my turn to show something more neutral:

I know Eric Anctil as a very erudit, thorough and well regarded scholar. His views are exactly in tune with the recent evidence!!!! To denouce is qualification is very rude bulliying and should not be permitted on this board!!!

::''Nordic origin, as possibly invented during the 4th century or as a genuine tradition in the form of a myth. However, this does not explain archaeological evidence for contacts during earlier periods. A reasonable explanation for similarities in the material cultures can be that they are products of long-term contacts, perhaps originating in connections between the Lusatian culture and other urnfield groups on the continent and eastern Scandinavia already during the Late Bronze Age – Early Iron Age. Regular contacts between high ranking groups in different geographic areas could eventually have developed into a close relationship between certain groups of the Wielbark culture and groups of people in Scandinavia, visible in similarities in material culture, language and burial customs. The archaeological record could indicate that Jordanes´ history concerning the origin of the Goths was based on an oral tradition with some sort of real background.''

:Polish archaeologists, who probably know most about the finds, take the Scandinavian origins for granted: 


I haven never met a Polish scholar who denied that the Wielbark culture was indigenous. Also, the most renoun expert on Wielbark archaeology is Volker Bierbrauer to whom most Polish scholarship referes with discussing these topics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

What you call &quot;POV scholarship&quot; -whatever that's supposed to mean- and &quot;pseudo-science&quot; is actually a well written study, which cites all the sources for its claims, a bit different than the links you've provided, which seem to dwell a bit too much in &quot;coulda, woulda, shoulda&quot; type of arguments(&quot;The archaeological record '''could''' indicate...&quot;, &quot;...the addition of Scandinavian migrants, who '''maybe''' arrived here...&quot;, &quot;A reasonable explanation for similarities in the material cultures '''can be''' that...&quot;), not any conclusive evidence, based on archaeology, not oral &quot;histories&quot;, for a supposed &quot;Scandinavian&quot; origin of the Goths. As pointed out by Anctil, there is no question of &quot;contact&quot; between the Goths of Poland and the people of Scandinavia, but what the archaeological record does not show -at least at the time Anctil wrote his paper- is a migratory movement from Scandinavia to Poland during the first century BCE or CE, therefore putting a strong doubt in a supposed &quot;Scandinavian&quot; origin.

Since you seem to question the credentials of anyone who doesn't agree with your opinions, Eric Anctil's brief bio here

[http://www.anctil.org/users/eric/]

You are more than welcome to contact him and (try) to show him that his &quot;POV scholarship&quot; and &quot;pseudo science&quot; is all &quot;flawed&quot; and that you can &quot;prove&quot; the Goths were indeed &quot;Scandinavians&quot;.

Regarding Polish archaeologists: to my knowledge, the Polish archaeologist who directed the most recent research on the Gothic sites in Poland is Andrzej J. Kokowski, but unfortunately I am not aware if any of his papers on this topic are available in English yet, so I don't know what his opinion on their origins is.


----

Andrzej Kokowski is a good friend of mine and we worked together on some exhibitions about Vandals and Goths in the past. He certainly is the leading Polish expert on Wielbark archaeology and you would hear from him nothing but that the Wielbark culture is indigenous to the Vistula region. He allows for some Scandinavian influence but always argues that the Wielbark-Goths did not come from Scandinavia.

:Yes, he allows for some Scandinavian influence. Moreoever, serious scholars usually do not equate archaeological culture with language or ethnicity in the way that you do.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 19:03, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)



--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you quote Kokowski if you don't know his opinion? Why do you have a problem with the careful wording of my quotes? Serious scholars are quite careful about what can be stated for a fact. Since you don't see the fallacies in Anctil's presentation, I will show them to you. There are several warning signs.
#he limits the time period to 100BC-100AD, consciously omitting the time prior to this. Why? The preceeding period probably does not fit his opinions.
#he proposes that they only came from the Continent. Where is his &quot;evidence&quot; for that? His only evidence is claiming that there is no &quot;evidence&quot; for the Scandinavian origin (NOTE: he has excluded the period prior to 100BC). Then, he uses the logic fallacy &quot;As there is not 100% evidence for theory A, this proves that theory B is right&quot; (for which there is no proof either, by the way). Non-scholars may fall for it, though, but I consider it to be spurious scholarship.
#I rarely see serious scholars use the term &quot;evidence&quot;. Most academically trained people are wary of such terminology. Pseudo-scholars love the word, though.
#He asserts his point of view and ignores the implications (did the Goths come from Germany or was Poland the cradle of the Germanic languages?).
#He asserts what fits his own ideas and avoids discussing the problems. That impresses very few scholars.
That is enough for now.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 18:02, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Name dropping&quot;? &quot;quoting&quot;? are you even reading the thread anymore? I '''mentioned''' Kokowski because I happen to know that he was the director of the most recent excavations in Poland, and I know he has already written some articles, but they are in Polish as far as I know. I don't know what his opinion on the origins of the Goths is... yet. If I find anything in English then I will be glad to let you, Anctil, and maybe even professor Peter Heather, know about it(that's if they are not already familiar with it.)

Regarding your &quot;points&quot;, which are all pretty much answered by Anctil's study already, I will answer the first 2, since the others are hardly serious and pretty much self-answerable with a bit of investigation:

1- No, because there isn't any evidence of older Gothic sites than that period.

2- Because the oldest identifiable &quot;Gothic&quot; graveyards are in Poland. Since no older ones have been discovered, not even in Sweden, their reputed &quot;homeland&quot; of legend, the most logical conclusion is that they were actually a continental people. 

Regarding &quot;serious scholars&quot; and &quot;pseudo-scholars&quot;: If you weren't so quick to attack the opinions that do not fit your agenda, you would have seen that Anctil identifies his sources very well. By checking his references with the bibliography you would already have found out who his main source is for his statements regarding the unlikely &quot;Scandinavian&quot; origins of the Goths. It's professor Peter Heather, author of quite a number of articles and books about the Goths. His books and articles are among the standard scholarly texts on this issue, and they are regarded as the first studies on the Goths to rely on the archaeological record, not just &quot;histories&quot; from ancient times:

[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1992/03.02.12.html]

[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/Book.asp?ref=0631209328]

The fact that you keep implicitly attacking Anctil as a &quot;pseudo-scholar&quot; -which he isn't- will not get away from the fact that, at least in the English-speaking Western world, this is a current academic view of the Goths based on the archaeological data. 

Now, whether the research of Polish archaeologists will change this or not is a matter of speculation at this point. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

:I did not attack him as a pseudo-scholar, I said that his way of arguing reminded me of one.

:You wrote: ''1- No, because there isn't any evidence of older Gothic sites than that period.''

:That is interesting, and then I guess he identifies &quot;Gothic&quot; with very specific traits and excludes other traits as non-Gothic right? However, what does this prove?

:You wrote: ''2- Because the oldest identifiable &quot;Gothic&quot; graveyards are in Poland. Since no older ones have been discovered, not even in Sweden, their reputed &quot;homeland&quot; of legend, the most logical conclusion is that they were actually a continental people.''

:We're again back to specific traits. Unfortunately, cultures change and I strongly doubt that the Goths started to identify themselves as Goths by presenting what today is specific archaeological traits.

:Consequently you claim that the Goths were Goths solely due to a specific material culture and not due to the use of a language (appearing from somewhere) or a line of common rulers, unlike most other nations. Perhaps you and Anctil have a very special definition of &quot;ethnicity&quot;. That is not wrong, but your definition may not be shared by everyone.

:Cultures just don't materialize out of nowhere in the year 100BC with an ethnic name and a culture. We don't know for a fact when a population that called themselves ''Goths'' appeared. All we have are opinions based on educated guesses, and assertions such as Anctil's do not impress me.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 20:57, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You seem to keep thinking it's &quot;Anctil's assertions&quot; rather than the current academic ones. Anctil wrote a paper where the subject of Gothic origins had to be touched, and his statements are based on current academic authorities, mainly the research of Peter Heather. Even more recent publications on the Goths agree with him and pretty much make it clear that Jordanes' proposed migration from &quot;Scandza&quot; is a myth with no evidence to back it up: 

[http://www.historie.ku.dk/medarbejdere/Christensen_arne_soeby.htm] 

[http://www.mtp.dk/catalogue?m=bi&amp;id=686]

[http://www.duerinck.com/goths.html]

Goth-Gepid, or Gotho-Gepedian, culture is originally from continental Europe. That's what modern research says so far. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am sorry, but do two scholars, Heather and Christensen, equate consensus in modern research? I have already given you two links to scholars who don't agree with them. You continue to assert what ''modern research'' says without acknowledging that there are diverging opinions. That is what Wikipedians call POV.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 15:48, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am sorry, but how come is it that these allegedly &quot;diverging opinions&quot; are preferable to the ones that a bit more straightforwardly argue that there is not much evidence for an Scandinavian origin of Gotho-Gepedian culture? This is what in the real world is called &quot;being arbitrarily selective&quot;. Heather is cited all over the place(a simple google search shows it.) If that is not pretty much evidence of how well recognized he is regarding the Goths, I don't know what is. 

Besides, even your somewhat speculative(&quot;could&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;, &quot;can be&quot;, etc.) links show reservations about this &quot;migration&quot; from Scandinavia to Poland:

&quot;During this period, some grave structures and objects demonstrate cultural contacts between Scandinavia and the Wielbark culture in Poland. Such finds have traditionally been connected with Jordanes´ Getica, and its account of a migration of Gothic people from Scandinavia. '''In modern research, the theory of a massive migration has generally been abandoned'''. The Wielbark culture is generally believed to have developed from earlier cultures in the same area.&quot;

One of your very own links, then, is not very positive on the migration route proposed by Jordanes, and acknowledges it to be &quot;generally abandoned&quot;, which pretty much should answer your doubts about what &quot;consensus in modern research&quot; says. What the book that you are linking to apparently wants to do is argue for an &quot;earlier&quot; contact(which does not necessarily equate into Goths = Scandinavians.) If there is a good argument for such earlier &quot;contact&quot; we'll have to wait and see(but that book has been available since 2001 and it doesn't seem to have changed the consensus that Gotho-Gepedian culture developed in continental Europe, otherwise I would expect to see more articles and books in favor of an Scandinavian origin. Instead, you'll find that Heather's books and articles are still widely quoted and used by people who write articles, papers or webpages on Gothic history, even as recently as 2004, as showed in one of the above links.) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You wrote: ''I am sorry, but how come is it that these allegedly &quot;diverging opinions&quot; are preferable''. 
Perhaps this is due to the fact that you'll rarely find an opinion that everyone agrees on in humanistics. During the last decades Chomsky was great in linguistics, but now his theories are becoming obsolete, because everyone did not agree with him, even during his age of greatness. Perhaps you'll find more scholars maintaining that the ethnogenesis of the Goths were in Poland. However, the Polish article does not even question the Scandinavian origins. 
You have to agree that theories are just theories. The Central European hypothesis is a theory, just like the Scandinavian origin hypothesis is a theory.
You may find this open approach to be objectionable, because it does not adapt the information to your point of view, but at Wikipedia, discussing several opinions is the preferred approach.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 18:28, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Though Linguistics may be, Archaeology is not exactly just &quot;humanistics&quot;, as it involves science as well, so this is not exactly a comparable case. And I was actually being a bit sarcastic when I asked that. I was just pointing out the apparent selective nature of the data the article chooses to show.  

The Polish article: unfortunately, it does not show any proof or argument whatsoever to justify its constant association of &quot;Goths&quot; with &quot;Scandinavians&quot;; it does so in a seemingly quite &quot;gratuitous&quot; manner. I suppose the author has, or thinks he has, his reasons, but he has not shared them with us(he seems to take it as a given that we all know they really were Scandinavians and doesn't bother to explain why is this so apparently &quot;clear&quot; to him.) If he had done so, I would have contacted Anctil, or maybe even Heather, and asked for opinions on such assurances. 

Regarding &quot;openness&quot;: The problem is precisely that the approach, at least in the case of this article, is hardly &quot;open&quot;. It is obvious that whoever the author is(you, perhaps?) is being arbitrarily selective in what data to show the readers. The fact that the alleged &quot;Scandinavian&quot; origin of Gotho-Gepedian culture is not proven at all, and that Jordanes account of migration is not corroborated -at least as far as the archaeological record is seen and understood by Western scholars like Heather- does not seem to be taken into consideration. Why aren't these views -which many seem to have no problem with, and in fact are rather standard and often quoted- being included in the article, and why is there such a favoritism for the (few) ones apparently claiming or suggesting an Scandinavian origin? That was the essence of my somewhat sarcastic observation in the form of a question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the scientific level of linguistics depends very much on the theory and on the approach (it's an extremely varied field). You are very welcome to add relevant information in a neutral manner. If you're unhappy with parts of the article, you have the right to modify it and I hope we can arrive at an article which we both can accept. At the moment the article does not claim that the Scandinavian origin is a fact, and I think that is OK. I'd prefer it not to be dogmatic about any point of view in this matter.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 20:36, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

P.S. Professional archaeologists are usually very sceptic about ascribing ethnic identities to archaeological cultures lacking written remains, such as the ''Gotho-Gepidic''.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 03:06, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, as the article currently stands, I have a problem mainly with the following parts:

&quot;The Goths were a Germanic tribe originating apparently in southern Sweden...&quot;

&quot;Although no alternative theory has been proposed for the appearance of Germanic tribes in northern Poland, some historians reject the idea that the Goths originated in Scandinavia. This is due to the fact that, disregarding Jordanes, the earliest literary evidence for the Goths (Tacitus and Ptolemy) puts them at the Vistula in 1st century AD. Such revisions do not, however, offer alternative hypotheses for the background of the Goths.&quot;

&quot;The material culture associated with these Goths (or better Gotones) is typically identified with the Wielbark/Willenberg culture, which has strong influences from the closely related culture of southern Scandinavia[2] (http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/gazociag/title5.htm). Moreover, in Västergötland, in Sweden, there is a sudden disappearance of villages prior to the appearance of Goths in Poland. Modern archaeological research consequently supports the Scandinavian origin of the Goths and the authenticity of their tradition[3] (http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/publications/opia/gothicabstract.htm).&quot;

It is not as &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;clear&quot; as that. The fact is that Jordanes' proposed migration from &quot;Scandza&quot;, which suggests a Scandinavian origin for the historical group of people called &quot;Goths&quot; by the Romans, has been &quot;generally abandoned&quot;, as clearly stated even by your very own link. And the archaeological record, as far as is seen by Western scholars, is not as &quot;clear-cut&quot; as the article seems to suggest. It rather points to a continental origin, according to Hachmann's(mentioned in one of Anctil's papers dealing with Jordanes' claims) and Heather's view.

Nevertheless, I admit that it is a bit puzzling why an article written by a Polish associate professor keeps insisting -unfortunately without providing explanatory arguments- in an association of &quot;Goths&quot; with &quot;Scandinavians&quot;. The author seems to take it for granted that a &quot;Gothic&quot; element is &quot;foreign&quot; to the local cultures of Poland(specially the &quot;Wielbark Culture&quot;, which he obviously believes developed locally from earlier cultures), as clearly seen in these passages:

&quot;Recent archaeological research and lengthy debate on this subject have, however, established that the Wielbark Culture did not simply come into being as a result of the arrival of '''tribes of Scandinavian Goths''' in Pomerania. Instead, it evolved from the development of the local Oksywie Culture, possibly having been subject to outside influences from Scvandinavia.&quot;

&quot;The Wielbark Culture appears to have been''' composed of Scandinavian Goths and Gepidae''' as well as of earlier local communities - the Venedi and Rugii... Whether the Wielbark Culture was really '''of Gothic ethnic origin''' or made up of a number of different tribes (including Goths), we cannot say.&quot;

It's obvious that this insistence on the allegedly &quot;foreign&quot; origin of the Goths and &quot;Gepidae&quot; is apparently quite in contrast with the statements by Hachmann and Heather that Goth-Gepid culture is of continental origin. It would be interesting to give that link to Heather -if he hasn't already read it- and ask for his take on it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, if Heather hypothesizes that the Goths could not have had a Scandinavian origin, he does so without evidence. Most archaeologists think that the Gothic culture and the Geatish culture were very similar. I fail to see how Heather can assert that there was no migration from Scandinavia when archaeologists find a Scandinavian influence on northern Poland following evidence of deteriorating climate in Scandinavia and a depopulation.

Neither [[Encarta]], [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] nor the [[BBC]] consider Heather's speculations to be worth mentioning. For the BBC see[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northeast/prog_08/index_02.shtml]

Moreover you seem to have misunderstood Hachman:
:Professor Erik Nylén of Gotland has also written a lot about Scandinavian/Gotlandic Goths and even '''Hachmann has agreed the Nordic peoples are Goths - not only the Vistula Goths'''.[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=gothic-l&amp;D=1&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=1299]

So far, the hypothesis of a non-Scandinavian origin contradicts what archaeologists and linguists know of Germanic origins and the Germanic langues, to quote Hooker (1996):

:Archaeologists put the geographical origin of the Germanic peoples in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany. There, they developed a warrior culture that was essentially democratic in character. As they migrated south and east, this democratic warrior society developed into a kingship and, as they came in contact with the Romans and Romanized Celts, they developed further aristocratic classes among the warriors and nobility. [...] '''The Goths originally migrated from Scandinavia''' and from there migrated south into Europe and east into southern Russia (some of their descendants still live in the Crimean area). The reason for this migration are unclear, but the standard, default interpretation is that they were pressured by overpopulation.[http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/MA/GERMANS.HTM]

A quote from Watkins at San José University:
:The most notable of the eastern Germanic tribes was the Goths. There is '''considerable historical evidence of the origin of the Goths in Scandinavia''', possibly the Baltic island of Gotland, but in the second century A.D. the Goth moved from the lower Vistula River region to the area north of the Black Sea.[http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/barbarians.htm]

Another quote from Linguistlist [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=gothic-l&amp;D=1&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=985]:
:First, East Germanic languages (of which Gothic was one) were closer to North Germanic (i.e. Scandinavian) tongues than to West Germanic ones. Such affinity implies a close relationship, if not direct derivation. The toponymics of the island of Gotland, as well as the modern Swedish provinces of Oester- and Vaestergoetland, where the Goths had supposedly originated, also show linguistic affinity. Second. Count Oxenstierna excavated incineration burials in Oester-and Vaestergoetland that, numerous in the second and first centuries B.C. suddenly became rare after about 50 B.C. This would suggest a disappearance of a significant portion of the previous population.&quot;

Another quote [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=gothic-l&amp;D=1&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=768]:

:Musset (a French scholar, my note) placed their Urheimat (the Germanic peoples, my note) in '''southern Scandinavia in the late Bronze Age, an area where no pre-Germanic linguistic substratum had been found''' (p. 4). From there some Germanic tribes spread along the Baltic coast, toward the Oder. Others followed the coast of the North Sea, toward the Weser. By 1000 BC, according to Musset, German habitat stretched from the Ems to central Pomerania (Demougeot dated their appearance in Pomerania much later, from 400 BC [ Demougeot, 1969, 45]. If we follow Musset, by 800 BC Germans reached Westphalia in the West and Vistula in the East. And 300 years later they could be found on the lower Rhine, in Thuringia and Lower Sileasia (Musset, I, 4).&quot;

I also fail to see why you claim that modern scholarship rejects Jordanes. 
Here is a list of modern scholarship who support Jordanes, from Linguistlist [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=gothic-l&amp;D=1&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=1531]

Try Google and search +Scandinavia +Goths, and you will find very few who reject Jordanes.

So far no one has been able to prove Jordanes wrong. On the contrary, there is no evidence against him whatsoever. The fact that a the Gotho-Gepidan culture evolved an alledged ''distinctiveness'' from that of Scandinavia could very well indicate that they were settled for some time in Northern Poland, after some of them, or all of them, had migrated from Scandinavia. 

I think the introduction &quot;apparently from southern Sweden&quot; is in accordance with the most wide-spread ideas about the Goths, modern scholarship and also with [[Encyclopedia Britannica]].--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 11:52, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== The Goths and Scandinavia ==

The explanation for Jordanes' (and modern researchers') association between Goths and Scandinavia may be due to two reasons. Modern authors have also consulted old English texts to associate them with Scandianvia. It is possible that Jordanes derives the Goths from [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] (''ca'' 100 AD) ''Go(u)tais'', most likely identical to the ''Cwens'' (or Quæns, &quot;the Kings&quot;) somewhere in Scandinavia; presumably a hunter-gathering group. Unfortunately, althought intresting, the essential sources on this group is Norse sagas. Besides being good magicians, they spend all their time on the battle-field fighting christianity. Unfortunately, this is not very much of scientific value and the Goths were actually one of the first groups adopting christianity. Scandinavia, in particular Sweden where you claim being the Gothic resident, was one of the ''last'' regions in Europe adopting Christianity!  Secondly but also intrestingly; names in Jordanes' ''Getica'' does also occure in the english poem [[Beowulf]]; but it is not clear whether they refers to Scandinavian Goths, or whether the poem actually refers to Goths in Central Europe. Note that the Slavic tribes' historical existence are very similar to the Gothic realm. Thus, I don't think it is a good idea to state that the Goths were actually Swedes. Just my cents. ([[User:83.226.130.159|83.226.130.159]] 10:09, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC))

#Jordanes wrote in the 6th century, when there was hardly any Old English literature.
#I don't see how you can connect the ''Goutai'' with the ''Quens''.
#''Quen'' has no such etymology that I have heard of. It is usually connected with a word for &quot;woman&quot;.
#The time when the Goths are believed to have migrated vary from the 7th century BC to the 1st century AD, so it is not relevant to discuss whether they were ethnic Swedes and neither does the article.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 16:11, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

This consideration is covered by some authors (See e.g. ''The Goths''; Peter Heather; 1996) because Ptolemy lists Goutais in his geographical tables which have been compared with  ''Two voyagers at the court of king Alfred : the ventures of Ohthere and Wulfstan ...''. Peter proposed to literary distinguish and divide Goths into ''Goths'' and ''Scandinavian Goths'', where Sc. G. sometimes refers to Goutais, sometimes to Geates. Note that Geates may not be &quot;Scandinavian&quot; at all, because Beowulf don't locate them geographically so the Scandinavian &quot;Goths&quot; merely refers to Goutais.

:I suggest that you don't take Heather's hypotheses for facts as he has his own ideas. Read some other authors to get a more balanced view.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 21:26, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::Well, he presents an idea due to the (most likely) misassociation, because the Goths after 6th century introduced the christianity and Scandinavia or Sweden has nothing to do with this. ([[User:83.226.130.159|83.226.130.159]] 21:45, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC))
:::The article does not claim so either. The article points out Sweden as the traditional original homeland of the Goths which was long before the 6th century.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 21:52, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:::: Maybee not, maybee, but it states that W/W culture have &quot;strong influences&quot; with Southern Scandinavia, when actually the article it refers to state there is only vague resamblence. Secondly, note that high-mounds were before something considered to be possible &quot;Gothic&quot; related. ([[User:83.226.130.159|83.226.130.159]] 00:45, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC))
:::::You apparently have not read the second link which states that the similarities may be due to long-term contacts. Archaelogists consider the WW culture to be similar to the Scandinavian culture. Moreover, I have a few questions for you:
#why do you claim that the article only states a ''vague resamblence'', when it plainly does not? It states that it is difficult to equate archaeological culture with ethnicity, and I hope you're familiar with this problem
#from where do you pick up the high mound argument? Burial customs varied, even in Scandinavia, and the mound tradition is thousands of years older.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 07:36, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Really, folks. 
There is '''no proof''' whatsoever that the Goths came from Scandinavia. Every respected scholar agrees that they came from the Eurasian steppes north of the Black sea, migrated into Scandinavia and not from Scandinavia. This is only a nationalromantic view of the Swedes. 
Read Stenroth, Ingmar &quot;Myten om goterna Från antiken till romantiken&quot;. It is obvious.
[[User:Motörhead Remember Me|Motörhead Remember Me]] ([[User talk:Motörhead Remember Me|talk]]) 15:39, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

I agree with the above. The myth of the origin of the Goths can be tracked back through the ages to the Roman Empire. There is absolutely nothing that supports the idea that Goths originated from Swedish territory.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/81.170.192.10|81.170.192.10]] ([[User talk:81.170.192.10|talk]]) 18:27, 21 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Discussion so far: An anonymous German (82.35.89.68) wants to remove any mention of a Scandinavian origin, which he has tried to do at [[Heruls]]. He claims that the only Pre-Roman Iron Age Germanic culture that was Germanic with &quot;certainty&quot; was the German [[Jastorf culture]]. This is a claim which would make Germany the cradle of the Germanic tribes. 

He names a number of German historians and a Dane, Christensen, as evidence against the possibility of a Gothic migration from Scandinavia. So far his evidence is restricted to naming scholars and to referring to German books.

Since he claims that his assertions are identical to ''modern scholarship''. I present a list of scholarship which does not agree with him (the authors of [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] are not included) and interestingly, they include an author that he refers to:

:Professor Erik '''Nylén''' of Gotland has also written a lot about Scandinavian/Gotlandic Goths and even '''Hachmann''' has agreed the Nordic peoples are Goths - not only the Vistula Goths. Yurij '''Knysch''' also had some good arguments for a Nordic connection. Herwig '''Wolfram''' also sees the connection.[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0205&amp;L=gothic-l&amp;D=1&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=1299]

'''Hooker''' (1996):

:Archaeologists put the geographical origin of the Germanic peoples in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany. There, they developed a warrior culture that was essentially democratic in character. As they migrated south and east, this democratic warrior society developed into a kingship and, as they came in contact with the Romans and Romanized Celts, they developed further aristocratic classes among the warriors and nobility.

First of all, there's no chance at all that Scandinavians simply sprang up ''de novo'', in autochthonous manner.  Surely we're all past that and won't be revising all of the rest of Wikipedia to have Homo sapiens appear first in Scandinavia.  Since this is something I've been interested in professionally for 30 years, let me say that it is generally agreed that ALL Scandinvanians come from a small founding population (Y chromosome R1a-) at around 6000 BP.  Denmark, surprisingly, has few longterm inhabitants before the rapid advance of the Neolithic, around 6000BP, probably 2000 years or less after the arising of blue eyes.  The original founding population of blue eyed people come from the area between Pskov/root of the Finnish peninsula and could be given any number of tribal names - but ALL blue-eyed people descend from those people and obviously, the brown alleles didn't exactly make it to Sweden and Norway in any great numbers until very recently (as in the last 100 years, even last 40 years).  Herwig Wolfram is not the only person drawing the intelligent conclusions noted above by an anonymous editor. The Wielbark culture, as a contiguous/related culture to the Hallstatt peoples seems indisputable.  The upper Vistula would be an appropriate place for the River-Cultures (which were more hierarchical and specialized in occupation) to meet the Blue-Eyed Sea People (whose sea-going skills were developing rapidly and whose eventual history is definitely well known).  But, the PIE root G~T, (Got, Gut, Gots, Goth, etc) PRECEDES the habitation of Sweden.  So this whole article needs major revision - starting with taking out that map of Sweden as the founding place of the Goths.  The Got/Gots/Goth people were very very enterprising and wonderful - and they were both part of a pre-existing family of Swedes as well as closely related to their mainland family (why wouldn't they be?).  Upper Vistula is a much better guess, genetically, linguistically, culturally etc.  BTW, the other interesting fact about the Vistula hypothesis is that they were river-boating people with several different methods of boat-building.  Someone had to build the boats, you know.  If evidence can be found that the sound sequence Got/Gut/Goth/Guth/Gutz etc was not in use until people arrived in Scandinavia - then that idea might have a go.  But that evidence simply isn't there; all the evidence points to the opposite.  I'm nearly in the mood to take that map out at the very least.  I think this discussion has gone on long enough and that enough has been said against the Swedish hypothesis.  There are no citations to support the map.LeValley 03:13, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

==The Goths and Scandinavia==

The explanation for Jordanes' (and modern researchers') association between Goths and Scandinavia may be due to two reasons. Modern authors have also consulted old English texts to associate them with Scandianvia. It is possible that Jordanes derives the Goths from [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] (''ca'' 100 AD) ''Go(u)tais'', most likely identical to the ''Cwens'' (or Quæns, &quot;the Kings&quot;) somewhere in Scandinavia; presumably a hunter-gathering group. Unfortunately, althought intresting, the essential sources on this group is Norse sagas. Besides being good magicians, they spend all their time on the battle-field fighting christianity. Unfortunately, this is not very much of scientific value and the Goths were actually one of the first groups adopting christianity. Scandinavia, in particular Sweden where you claim being the Gothic resident, was one of the ''last'' regions in Europe adopting Christianity!  Secondly but also intrestingly; names in Jordanes' ''Getica'' does also occure in the english poem [[Beowulf]]; but it is not clear whether they refers to Scandinavian Goths, or whether the poem actually refers to Goths in Central Europe. Note that the Slavic tribes' historical existence are very similar to the Gothic realm. Thus, I don't think it is a good idea to state that the Goths were actually Swedes. Just my cents.

#Jordanes wrote in the 6th century, when there was hardly any Old English literature.
#I don't see how you can connect the ''Goutai'' with the ''Quens''.
#''Quen'' has no such etymology that I have heard of. It is usually connected with a word for &quot;woman&quot;.
#The time when the Goths are believed to have migrated vary from the 7th century BC to the 1st century AD, so it is not relevant to discuss whether they were ethnic Swedes and neither does the article.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 16:11, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

This consideration is covered by some authors (See e.g. ''The Goths''; Peter Heather; 1996) because Ptolemy lists Goutais in his geographical tables which have been compared with  ''Two voyagers at the court of king Alfred : the ventures of Ohthere and Wulfstan ...''. Peter proposed to literary distinguish and divide Goths into ''Goths'' and ''Scandinavian Goths'', where Sc. G. sometimes refers to Goutais, sometimes to Geates. Note that Geates may not be &quot;Scandinavian&quot; at all, because Beowulf don't locate them geographically so the Scandinavian &quot;Goths&quot; merely refers to Goutais.

(Wulfila refers to records describing the Goths as pagan, but does not mention this, whereas he self derives his history as being one of the first Christian Europeans.)

&quot;Since many &quot;Germanist&quot; historians practically avoid the issue of archaeology altogether, Peter Heather's The Goths (1996) was mainly used in reconstructing the historical scenarios as described by Jordanes. Heather paraphrases the earlier work '''established by German authors like Hachmann who discovered that a &quot;Gotho-Gepedian&quot; culture more likely originated from northern Continental Europe rather than southern Sweden''' (Heather 1996, 14).&quot; [http://www.anctil.org/users/eric/hist376.html]

That is the reason why Heather's book is valuable for researchers, and why he chose it before others available back then. Also, notice that Hachmann is mentioned, and it is clearly said that he does not propose a Scandinavian origin but a continental one.

''In order to explain to you I will quote my criticism.'' 

I am already aware of your &quot;criticism&quot;, but most of it can hardly be considered major opposition. You keep bringing up moot points, most of which Anctil and others are already well aware of, but they still prove or deny nothing. 

:If Anctil was aware of those moot points, why did he not consent that his arguments had problems?--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 20:33, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Anctil gives more importance to archaeology -and rightly so- than &quot;Germanist&quot; speculations. According to Anctil(who bases his conclusions mostly on Heather's), there is no archaeological evidence suggesting a Scandinavian origin of the Goths that is earlier than the sites found in Poland, therefore the most logical conclusion is that such a culture originated on the continent, and later &quot;exported&quot; some aspects of its culture to Scandinavia. Some Scandinavians -whether &quot;aristocrats&quot;, or &quot;peasants&quot;, or whatever- among them does not translate into &quot;Goths = Scandinavians&quot;. 

:So you don't like the equation Goths=Scandinavians? I suspected as much. AFAIK, very few people have ever suggested that the Goths were &quot;pure&quot; Scandinavians. If you are aware of the history of known population movements, such as the Anglo-Saxons, you may know that immigrating rulers usually assimilate parts of the earlier populations.

''If you settle in a new territory, perhaps as an aristocracy, you hardly bring the pottery with you, do you? That is why archaeologists normally do not speculate about ethnicity''

That's funny because even the author of one of your links [http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/gazociag/title5.htm] does that. Despite claiming that it is difficult to put ethnic origins on &quot;archaeologically defined cultures&quot;, he keeps assuming and asserting -without providing any clear explanations- the supposedly Scandinavian origin of the Goths and &quot;Gepidae&quot;. I guess that if we can pretend to rule out Anctil on such rather &quot;loose&quot; premises we can also safely discard good ol' Tadeusz Makiewicz as a &quot;pseudo-scholar&quot; as well.

''He proposes, he hardly proves such an origin, right?''

In Hachmann's times there probably still wasn't enough archaeological evidence for him to fully prove it. By Heather's times things were a bit different, as there now was much more archaeological data. 

:Even very probable invasions such as the [[Battle-axe people]] are ruled out as &quot;cultural diffusion&quot;, by archaeologists. I don't see how you could arrive at such facts through archaeology.

''I reiterate that few archaeologists speculate on ethnicity and language in connection with archaeological cultures. Moreover, it is spurious to call material continuity evidence concerting non-material issues such as language and ethnicity''

Funny because that's what Tadeusz Makiewicz does -whether wittingly or unwittingly, I am not sure- in such passages as:

&quot;Recent archaeological research and lengthy debate on this subject have, however, established that the Wielbark Culture did not simply come into being as a result of the arrival of tribes of '''Scandinavian Goths''' in Pomerania.&quot;   

&quot;Wielbark communities comprised mostly members of tribes already settled in this area with the addition of '''Scandinavian migrants''', who maybe arrived here in small groups.&quot; 

&quot;The Wielbark Culture appears to have been composed of '''Scandinavian Goths and Gepidae''' as well as of '''earlier local communities - the Venedi and Rugii'''.&quot;

He certainly seems to be very at ease assigning geographical/cultural origins to different groups, doesn't he? Unfortunately he forgot to clearly explain why such associations seem so &quot;clear&quot; to him.

The origin of the Goths in Scandinavia is, as alreadey mentioned, quite dubious. Besides Christensen and Heather cf. Volker Bierbrauer in ''Frühmittelalterliche Studien'' 28, pp. 51ff. Jordanes presents us a constructed history, the origin in Scandinavia is meant as a topos.



I agree that the Scandinavian origin of the Goths is a controversial issue. However, I do not agree that &quot;the stance that [Swedish] historians take in the issue is an ideological symbol&quot;.

==Genetics==
I have removed the following section, which looks like original research. It does not seem worthwile to keep in the article for the following reason: If the comparison between modern Swedes and modern Spaniards is to say anything about the number of Spaniards patrilineally descended from Swedish Goths, the section has to describe the distribution of haplogroups prior to the Gothic invasion and exclude other genetic contributions:

:''Since their early migrations from northern Europe, the Goths had mixed with numerous other nations, whether [[Oksywie culture]], [[Zarubintsy culture]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Dacians]], etc. Consequently there were probably few &quot;pure blooded&quot; Goths at the time when they invaded Spain.''

:''It should consequently be difficult to find any larger Germanic genetic influx in Spain. The following shows the relative percentages of the Swedish and German populations contributed by the various Y chromosone haplogroups - [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] Hg (42 v 19%), [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] (22v 44%), [[Haplogroup R1a1 (Y-DNA)|R1a]] (19 v 12%){{Talkfact}}. Hence any chromosone signature related to the Goths would be lost in the genetic noise associated with the ancestral Germanic populations{{Talkfact}}. Further when looking at Spain one finds the I &amp; R1a Hg contents dropping away to only 8 &amp; 2% respectively{{Talkfact}}. Whilst it would be tempting to set an upper limit of 10% of Spain's population being paternally descended from Swedish Goths, this calculation assumes that the ancestral Spanish population had no prior R1a Hg content before the arrival of the Goths.''

I don't think it gives any valuable information whatsoever as the number of Spaniards with Swedish haplotypes could be anything from 0% to 10%. It is misdirected original research, IMHO.--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 12:07, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

::I fully agree. This section does not give us any important and relevant information about Goths (to sum it up: &quot;the Spaniards may have some Scandinavian genes or maybe not&quot;). Even if it weren't original research it's not conclusive enough to be useful. [[User:Friendly Neighbour|Friendly Neighbour]] 12:54, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

There has been a lot of work done recently with genetics and ancient peoples. Many articles talk about it .. [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Huns]].. we should not discount the ongoing genetics research which is new, often inconclusive, but interesting and cutting edge. This particular paragraph looks accurate (who would.. ''could'' ..  make it up?) but it is unsourced. If there was a source we could summarize the findings, removing the biology class gobblygook. But we need a source to attribute. I plan on reading a recent survey on the Goths soon and will keep an eye out for more info. No doubt the Goths origins is a complex and controversial disucussion. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 16:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;Small Text&lt;/small&gt;


==Origins of Goths==
I think the article is well writen and a huge work. It represents one angle on the Gothic migration which describes the migration from Goths from Scanza down the vistula and eventually ends up settled at the eastern Balkans as a treaty with Emperor Valens in 376. 

What I think most people are questioning about this article is that this theory of migration is under criticism from alot of sides and the archeological founds does not prove that this migration has existed but neither do they deny it. The current research on the field do question this and what they emphasize is that a new research is to be done without having &quot;getica&quot; as a valid source because its simply too unrealiable. The problem is we know that there are alot of nonesense in &quot;getica&quot; like reports of romans at the battle of troy and Amazons. This damage the value of the &quot;getica&quot; because we know some parts of its are deliberatly lies and some parts of it &quot;might&quot; be true. But have do way to seperate the lies from the truths in getica without speculating.

To mention some of the writers which I have studied some reject and other agrees with this &quot;long migration of the goths&quot;.

Wolfram, Wenskus, Walther Pohl Argues for the migration and origin of the Goths in Scandinavia. And they all use Getica to do this. Heather do no think highly of Getica. But he do belive that the Migration can be proved from studying the Archeological founds down the Vistula. 

Goffart, Guy Hallsall and Patrick Armory argues for a new research needs to be done and they all deny that &quot;getica&quot; can be used as source. Further more they question the Archeological data available. As mentioned in the Article the Wielbark and cernjachov cultures. Guy Halsall concludes that the evidence is simply not there to prove the Migration and the link between the Wielbark and cernjachov as a migration from Scanza down to the east balkans
{{Quotation|align=center|&quot;In short no Prima facie archaelogical evidence exist of a migration up the vistula to the black sea shores&quot;|Halsall, Guy (1999|&quot;Review article. Movers and shakers: the barbarians and the fall of Rome. Early medieval europe 8}}  

Walter Goffart disagrees with Wolframs ideas of the migration and goths on many points. He deny the idea of &quot;core of traditions&quot; and the thought the the Goths could have originated in Scandinavia and move all the way down the vistula as &quot;stämme&quot;. He reject the entire notion of a gothic history and that we cannot say anything about the goths untill 376, everything before is pure imagination. To quote Goffart about the migration of goths:

{{Quotation|align=center|&quot;Two very distinct courses are available to us, depending on the quality of evidence and the scale of conjecture and combination we are willing to tolerate. Those very strict in the selection and handling of sources will refuse to go farther afield than to the lands bordering tge Roman Empire in the fourth century A.D. Those however, Who welcome a wider range of documentation and liberally resort to hypothesis and speculation will find it possible and even desirable to reach as far out in space as Scandinavia and as far back in time as before the Christian era. This major difference of approach to the period of Barbarian invasions deserves to be spelled out and eloborated because little is said about it outside German acedemic scene&quot;|Goffart, Walter (1980)|Barbarians and romans A.D. 418-584: The techniques for accomodation}}

So in short. As to whether or not the Goths origined from Scandinavia is questionable. It cant be denied but neither confirmed. The argumentation of the field of scientist are still going strong and what most want is a new research with the starting point &quot;That no barbarian migration existed unless it can be proven from archeological founds&quot; Problem with todays archeological founds is that they are made with &quot;getica&quot; in the back of the head. So you find what you want to find. The artefacts from the Wielbark area in Cernajachov are seen as proof of the migration but the founds of Cernjachov artefacts in the Wielbark area is seen as a sign of trade. But however, cant it be possible that the wielbark artefacts in Cernjachov are sign of trades and not proof of the migration? The vistuale was one of the biggest trading areas anyhow.

As to the article, I dont think its neccesary to change anything, perhaps add a section about the ongoing discussion and the Heavy critisicm of Getica and the current archealogical findings. But again it depends what View you have on the barbarian migration. I like how the article stress that story is taken from Jordannes so people can decide wether they see Getica as a reliant source. 

Ive not created a profile but Im a danish history student at the university of Copenhagen. My course is exactly about this subject and my Teacher is &quot;Arne Søbe Christensen&quot; who has been mentioned aswell and who self question wether the goths originated in Scandinavia. Keep up the good work and the discussion :)

:This is an excellent comment - thanks. Another author that disagrees with the standard &quot;out of Scandinavia&quot; theory is Michael Kulikowski in his latest 2006 book ''Rome's Gothic Wars'' - there seems to be a lot of very good reasons to doubt the evidence of a Scandinavian origin.

::It will inevitably turn into such an article in the long run. Considering how unlikely some find the crossing of the Baltic sea, it is amazing how little credit is given to the sea-faring abilities of Iron Age Scandinavians ;-).--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 08:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:::According to Andrzej Kokowski &quot;Archäologie der Goten&quot; (1999) they probably used the same route as all other migrations across the Baltic: Scania &lt;-&gt; [[Bornholm]] &lt;-&gt; Middle Pomerania which means one day sailing only on both sides of Bornholm. This would mean that landing in the mouth of Vistula could be a mistake (or oversimplification) of Jordanes. The interesting thing is that only one of many burial sites with stone rings - of typical Scandinavian provenience - was found close to the sea shore. And it is not in the vicinity of [[Vistula]] mouth but close to the mouth of [[Słupia]] (Stolpe) which is directly downwind from... Bornholm with the prevailing north-western winds (see [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Ustka,+poland&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=7&amp;ll=55.028022,14.886475&amp;spn=1.977391,8.503418&amp;t=h&amp;om=0 this Google Map with the sole coastal stone ring site marked]). All the other stone rings are in the areas in the lake district which was not inhabited for some time before the Scandinavian arrival. This is why Kokowski believes that the new tribe from Scandinavia (Goths) was invited by the tribes (possibly earlier immigrants related to the new arrivals) living around Vistula moth and Baltic shore, (Gepides ?) to create a buffer zone between them and the [[Przeworsk culture]] (most probably Vandals and their allies). It would seem they moved in by the shortest route and Vistula mouth became important only later when they evacuated the lake district to invade territories along both the [[Bug]] rivers joining Baltic and Black Sea areas (BTW the name Bug is probably of Vandal origin) which could explain the Jordanes narrative. So much for the non-Scandinavian origin. [[User:Friendly Neighbour|Friendly Neighbour]] 08:41, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
::::Yes, maybe there should be a section on why the crossing of the Baltic sea is felt to be so unlikely by some. The grounds for scepticism should be thoroughly explained, because I am very curious about them myself. The only reason that I know of, so far, is that we should be sceptical of the Getica, which is not a very convincing argument, IMHO. It is like saying &quot;either this source tells the truth or it lies, and since it is not entirely reliable, it probably lies&quot;, which is a very strong claim.--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 09:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::First of all wanna thank the one putting my post in the right place and Im the same danish student here (need to make and account). I think what most people find dangerous about &quot;getica&quot; is its build around alot of arguments who jordannes couldnt have possible known. To present some of the ones I read about. First of all its the entire argumentation by modern scholars who think highly of getica particular Wolfram, who question the idea that a &quot;stämme&quot; bound by ties of blood originates(my english really lacks a better description, I mean a &quot;volk&quot; with genetic and blood bounds) from scandinavic and move too the balkans. But what wolfram do believe in is that the &quot;nuclei of tradition&quot; or an Elite migrating all the way down to the black sea and eventually ending up as we all know inside the roman empire. This is what Wolfram believes. None believes that the Goths all are a blond bunch of scandinavians migrating in a tight genetic community with the exception of perhaps the nazis under 2. world war. Wolfram thinks they are a mixture of other people joining up amongst the migration but the &quot;core&quot; of the tribe is made from Scandinavic kings. This is really interesting. We all know Jordannes in no possible way could have Facts about this because hes writing somewhere in the 550s so Jordannes must have the knowledge af the Amali ( the kings of goths) from someone. And this is where many scholars believes that Jordannes is rewritting everything from Cassiodorus &quot;gothic history&quot; which is lost. Cassiodorus is meant to be instructed by Theoderic to write a gothic history. Exploring the genealogy of the amali by cassiodurus must have excisted on Sagas and spoken legends of prehestoric kings of the amali. So what are the odds that Theoderic can actually remember his royal line sofar befind as the migration from scandinavic? Its a shame I dont have the list but we have seen and discussed it a couble of times with &quot;arne søbe christensen&quot; and the line usually break after 3-4 steps backwards were kings are mentioned who we simply have no knowledge about at all. So at some point the line might possible have been made up by either Theoderic or Cassiodorus. So the entire Gothic legendary story is a best uncertain - But I need to stress that it can be true ofcourse!

:::::Looking at reasons for why the gothic history is written brings sceptives to some other thoughts. Armory and Goffart both interpretate Jordannes Getica as a story to present the romans for a gothic people just as proud as the romans. The roman legacy leads back to troy, so what jordannes and possible ( we have no idea since the work is lost ) Cassiodorus wanted to do was to present a new gothic tribe who goes as far back in time as the roman people which makes the Goths a respectable tribe. Problem is they cant mention the Gothic history originated at troy, because the Greek literature already have written alot about that event. So too create a new legendary story Scandinavian gives completely free bounds to write whatever possible you want about the distant past making the goths just as old, perhaps even older, than the romans and thereby respected. When jordannes is writing in 550 is the period where Justinian and the eastern roman empire is trying to reconquer the &quot;lost&quot; west. What Goffart and Armory does is suggest that Getica is not a historically correct story but its trying to convice the romans that they do not fear the Goths because there distant past is just as splendid as the romans. They are not just &quot;mere&quot; barbarians.

:::::As to the archealogy. There are little doubt that the Cernjachov culture is connected with the Goths we seen enter the roman empire in 376. The wielbark culture is often linked with parts of scandinavia aswell. The problem is there are no evidence between the Wielbark and Cernjachov culture which proves the migration. To put in another quote from Guy Halsall

::::: &quot;A link between the between the Gernajachov culture and the fourth century gothic polities seems certain; Connecting this culture with the Wielbark and thus a gothic migration from the baltic is trickier&quot; Halsall, guy : (1999)

:::::So the discussion is not about what the Wielbark culture is really combosed of, Might have been some scandinavic tribes, might havent. The discussion is if the link is there between the Wielbark and cernjachov proving some sort of migration. Some find a link, other do not. The most heavy criticism is as I mentioned before is its not possible to prove wether artefacts from Wielbark in cernjachov is there because of trade or migration as its not possible to prove wether artefacts in Wielbark from Cernjachov is trade or migration. As much as I find archealogy intersting the problem is with todays technology its not really possible to say alot. Thats why many archealogys have the notion of the migration from Getica and then find in the ground artefacts who supports this migration and everything who rejects it are seen as sign of trades, because the migration is documented in the Getica right so why not make it true? (Irony, might sounds harsh and hope no archealogist are offended but it is a real criticism on todays finding. I have the utmost respect from archealogist its one of the more Secure ways of documenting the past :)).

:::::this leads to more question. First why would the Scandinavic people even want to migrate? Ive heard theories from overpopulation, In search of better farming grounds and the idea of a &quot;Wanderstämme&quot; which wolfram apply. To question some of them, we often hear about a close density of settlements in the Wielbark area which could suggest overpopulation, but again we also know those settlements are small and shortlived which rejects the idea of overpopulation. The goths in search of farming grounds, again we need to question why the migration happens as it does. If they were in search of farming grounds why do they wait so long with the migration. secondly we know that when the Goths enters the roman empire in 376, that some goths stay behind. Why do these stay behind if they are in search of farming lands? Wolframs &quot;wänderstamme&quot; theory is hard to deny but also hard to confirm. That some tribes wander because they are &quot;born&quot;(lack of better word) to it. 

:::::Finally you can critisize the entier idea about the migration by the the idea thats its too much based on the need to find the &quot;coherent&quot; history. I mean, you know the viking migratied south so why not the goths? Same with the huns. You know the mongols invated europe so why not project the Huns back to the same starting point as the mongols.

:::::In the end we have to theorys to make this very long post short. 
:::::1: The migration from scandinavic or atleast the Wielbark area.
:::::2: The idea that the Goths origins in the Cernjachov area somewhere in the East balkans and always have lived here before they enter the Roman empire. Perhaps because they are pushed by the huns? In the end we have no clue.

:::::The first theory is alot more exiting and it does say alot more, which is exactly the problem about the second theory, that it actually says very little and we have no knowledge about this. People want interesting storys thats why I think the first theory is so widely backup same with the Barbarian invasion theory causing the collapse of rome. And In the end I think there is nothing wrong with having an article like this about the goths, after all Getica is a source whatever way we twist and turn the facts and the chance of it being true are there. Its mainly new research we are talking about here so no need to change to article untill we are more sure about what really went on if we ever will be. It still is a very good article and none can infute it as being untrue. I wouldnt mind though if someone wrote another part with the ongoing discussion but for me it arent vital because the research still is very new and rather wait to its discussed more before adding it and half depated trough possition.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:80.164.83.90|80.164.83.90]] ([[User talk:80.164.83.90|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/80.164.83.90|contribs]]){{#if:{{{2|}}}|&amp;#32;{{{2}}}|}}.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
You should get yourself an account and start contributing to the articles. First of all - the devil is in the details. You raise many questions that together show how hard studies in humanistics are in general:
#Do the Goths equate the Chernyakhov culture? Yes, most likely, but can we be 100% sure? No.
#Do the Goths equate the Wielbark culture? Yes, probably, but can we be 100% sure? No.
#Can we infer a connection between the Wielbark culture and the Chernyakhov culture? Here the certainty is inevitably even less certain since material objects are easily replaced during migrations. As Nordengren told me in personal communication: you don't bring all the pottery when you migrate. You can easily get new new ones of local manufacture when you arrive.
#Is there a connection between Scandinavia and the Wielbark culture? Yes, there is, but does it prove a migration? No.
All these points bring in uncertainty about the origins of the Goths, and the more you look into the details, the more easy it is to question everything. However, what most scholars do, I guess, is to put the appearance of the Goths near the Roman borders in the context of the Germanic migrations from Northern Europe, more generally. There were probably many reasons why Scandinavians would like to migrate, since you find a similar exodus during the Viking Age.--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 14:15, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

==Goths in Finland?==
In Finland there is a small group of cemeteries very similar to the ones Ostrogothia and in the Wielbark culture. This fact as well as numerous Germanic loan-words in Finnish have given birth to a theory of limited Gothic and/or East Scandinavian settlement or at least cultural influence in Finland. Do you think this should be mentioned in this article?--[[User:130.234.75.20|130.234.75.20]] 14:36, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:[[User:Drieakko]] was written on [[Talk:Sitones]] that there was an early Swedish settlement  0 - 200 CE (so early that its language must have been [[Proto-Germanic]]) in South-Western Finland.

::That is interesting. According to the internal chronology of the Ynglinga saga, [[Dag the Wise]] made a raid on the Goths at the time when they would still be living on the shores of the Baltic sea. A Swedish scholar named Sundquist has written a recent dissertation on [[Ynglingatal]] (Sundquist, O. &quot;Freyr&quot;s offspring. Rulers and religion in ancient Svea society&quot;. 2004) showing that Ynglingatal is largely based on real events. To summarize his thesis: there are so many details in Ynglingatal that are confirmed by archaeology that the tradition is very unlikely to be entirely [[12th century]] fiction, as some saga-bashers want to make it out to be.--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 19:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Dag the Wise's son [[Agne]] was the one who allegedly raided Finland, possibly at the end of the 4th century. Very roughly around the same time the Germanic characteristics of the coastal Finnish population cease to exist, even though there is no evidence that it would have happened abruptly. Agne's raid in Finland is however the last mention of any relevant things happening in Finland in the first Millennium, from the Swedish point of view. Freely speculating, Ynglingasaga's Finland related stories may be remnants of interaction between the Germanic settlers in Finland and their homeland relatives. Once the settlements had lost their Germanic nature and language, there was not much activity on that front any more. --[[User:Drieakko|Drieakko]] 20:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
::::If the Germanic settlement is connected with Agne's raid, it could mean that the Germanic settlement disappeared because of Swedish attacks. The survivors could have merged with the Fenno-Ugric tribes dispersing the Proto-Germanic loan-words in Finnish.

==Where they came from vs. who they were==

It seems the older sections all focus on one question: where did the Goths come from? (which doesn't lend itself to clear answers anyway) and neglected several other questions: who were the Goths? how did they live? etc. (which archaeological evidence can help answer).

I've started short sections of settlement patterns &amp; burial practices. But it seems like most of the article is devoted to perpetually-disputed Swedish-Polish connections much earlier, and very little to the 3rd century, 4th century, or after, or to descriptions of their way of life.

==Does this actually mean anything, and if so, what?==

Quoting from the language section: &quot;Similarly, the Saxon dialects of Germany are hardly closer to Anglo-Saxon than any other West Germanic language that hasn't undergone the High German consonant shift (see Grimm's law), but the tribes themselves are definitely identical.&quot; I can't figure out what the last passage means. There are English who are not (upper) Saxon and there are (upper) Saxons who are not English, so the two groups are not identical; rather they derive certain elements of English-ness and Saxon-ness from the common origin.

==Etymologically identical==

I haven't encountered this syntagm so far.

Therefore if one claims Gutar and Goths are &quot;etymologically identical&quot; he has to show how Goths and Gutar evolved linguistically (or to bring a scholar reference for that).

Should we create one? It would provide a place to discuss Gothic origins, different models, etc. without giving undue weight on this page (and repeating the discussions on other pages). We would have three main issues (1) the origin of the Baltic Goths (and the importance of the Scandinavian connection), (2) the origin of the Black Sea Goths (and different models: mass migration, smaller migration and Gothic conquest/elite dominance, smaller migration and Gothicization (locals become Goths) and/or Dacian/Sarmationization (Goths become locals), etc.), (3) the origin of the later Visigoths and Ostrogoths.

::It certainly could.  But it would be long and complex to write.  I've been researching the question of various tribal origins for a couple of decades, and read on average 40-100 pages of scholarly material a day.  I got stuck with trying to figure out the period 12-17,000BP, wherein a great deal of molecular evidence is now rewriting views on linguistic evidence (not to mention continued archaeological finds).   The lack of material culture in areas later claimed to the the &quot;origin&quot; of Goths (meaning, the people in those areas had very few tools, no fired clay goods, etc) is problematic.  Usually, when a people have an &quot;origin,&quot; they have enough people and material to be considered &quot;a people.&quot;  This makes most anthropologists and prehistorians look to a Pontic origin (both the Y chromosome and linguistic evidence seem tantalizing - but it is a complex discussion.&quot;  Certainly the sound sequence G^t is around a long time, probably longer than lund/land (which is probably 'in, 'lin in the Pontic regions).  So if someone called themselves Goths around 8000BP and lived in one of the Black Lake River drainages (IIRC, the Black Sea was still freshwater at that point), that would be a viable hypothesis (they would have picked up suffixes a bit later).  But which river?  For that, we have to have a notion of what &quot;pre-historic Goth&quot; is - and it seems to be a swirling group of tribes just outside the continuous inspection of both the Greeks and the Romans.  All three groups (Greeks, Romans and Goths) almost certainly share common ancestry...so where to begin and how far back to take it, would be difficult questions.  But very pertinent and interesting.--LeValley 04:26, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

==D.H. Green on the Bastarnae==

Green, D.H., ''Language and History in the early Germanic World'', pp. 164ff, identifies the Bastarnae as an East-Germanic group, and argues that some East-Germanic speakers had settled the Black Sea area as early as the 2nd Century B.C.E. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 02:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
:Thats the article [[Bastarnae]]. It's sometimes (often?) assumed, without real proofs, that they were &quot;assimilated with&quot; the Goths or more probably, constituting one important contingent of the Ostrogothic kingdom of early AD centuries up until the Hunn catastrophe.

== Roman and [[Cappadocian]] prisoners ==

It's my understanding (based third-hand) that the prisoners came from [[Cappadocian]], which was part of the Roman Empire, but also from other parts of the Roman Empire as well. Which is why the original &quot;Roman prisoners&quot; seemed like the best option. I'm not sure why we need to specify [[Cappadocian]], why not just say they were &quot;Roman&quot;, which is really the most important element in the context of the sentence. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 23:53, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
:Agree with Stbalbach. The &quot;some were Cappadocian&quot; angle is appropriate to the [[Ulfilas]] article as well as an article on the Conversion, but really not needed in the general article on the Goths. I think the issues of persecution, conversion rate, and the supposed war between Fritigern and Athanaric are more important here. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 00:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

:I think (contra Kulikowski) that the Vistula (Weilbark) origin is well-established, mostly because the [[Gothic language]] is so thoroughly Germanic. We have linguistics, archaeology, and Jordanes telling similar stories; I don't trust Jordanes but I trust the linguistic resemblance (same four cases, Grimm's law, etc.), the archaeological resemblance (near-complete absence of weapon burials), and, generally speaking, the expertise of the scholars involved. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 01:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm going to ask, as I always do when I hear that something is linguistically &quot;thoroughly Germanic,&quot; what does that mean?  I know all about PIE, and I know that Latin, Greek Sanskrit and Celto-Slavic show up early indeed.  The shift in Grimm's law is thought to have occurred 1000B.C.E. - but it's highly likely the Goths were around before that (and underwent the shift; for whatever reason it occurred; but there is no general agreement what to call THAT language - the one that shifted...and it took some time for so many &quot;Germanic&quot; tribes to rise - it seems inconceivable that all those tribes appeared in between 1000 B.C.E. and 800.B.C.E. when their names start to be written down by Greeks.  Indeed, the word Germanic, which is retroactively applied (because the Grimms were studying from their own present, backwards) implies things about the Goths (such as that they were from the modern nation that English speakers call Germany) is not the most academic for this purpose and may well be changing.   If we are going to say the Goths are &quot;thoroughly German&quot; linguistically, we have to explain the difference between culture, language, genes and geography a bit better, is what I'm trying to say.  And good luck with that!  Someone needs to write a book and make it clear, so we can cite it.   But seriously, is there any evidence that the Grimm's law shift took place before (or after) the shifters came to the Danube? --LeValley 04:44, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

Food for thought :) The opposite to the premise may also be valid, i.e., the Tribes of Israel may have also had Gothic members.&lt;br /&gt; Please bear with my convoluted hypothetical analysis. Consider that both the Hittite an Egyptian empires around the time of the exodus were multi-ethnic cosmopolitan empires who drew in professionals of many nationalities. The province of Canaan, situated between (and at times a part of) these two empires was by no means homogenous. The widowed [[Mitanni]]-Egyptian queen [[Nefertiti]] was unable to secure peace and union when the [[Hittite]] prince she was to marry was assasinated en route to Egypt, possibly at the hands of her (hypothetically) adoptive father [[Ay]], q.v. 'Secrets of the Exodus' book.&lt;br /&gt; According to that book, the tribes of Israel were composed of Judah (former priests of the Egyptian empire who had converted to monotheism under [[Akhenaten]]), and settled strategically closer to Egypt, and the 'Erev-rav' ('common people' of the empire, 'Hebrews'). The Erev-rav had comprised the various layers of the Egyptian (monotheistic [and polytheistic]) bureaucracy under Akhenaten as 'servants' in the sense of 'public servants'. These public servants were multiethnic (e.g. ancestors of the [[Masai]] 'police', [[Hittites]], [[Minoans]], [[Akkadians]], descendants of the [[Guti]] etc.) and skilled. They were not killed due to differences in faith with that of the Egyptian empire, but were escorted in a civilised manner to repopulate the promised border province that the Egyptians had lost.&lt;br /&gt; Later modification of the old testament during the Babylonian captivity distanced literarily the Tribes of Israel from the Egyptian rivals of the Babylonians. The crisis of the 'moving of the people' was that the border province of Canaan was not firmly under Egyptian control, and had to be reconquered by [[Seti I]] aka [[Joshua]] (son of Nun), before the people could settle there in security. This is just a possibility mind you, but one worth considering when venturing into the 'outlier' discussion about Goths and the Lost (non-Judah &amp; -Benjamin) Tribes of Israel, who in this hypothesis are more predominantly defined by adherence to a common faith in one G-d than their ethnicity - perhaps this had something indirectly to do with their later disappearance?

Art Banta, and Lois Banta (2004).&lt;br /&gt; The book also mentions Nefertiti (daughter of a priest of the [[Mitanni]] who are a tribe related to the [[Guti]]), influencing her husband Akhenaten and co-founding the monotheistic worship of the solar disk, which leads to the escorted exodus of the monotheistic Egyptians to the frontier provinces in Canaan.

:A different etymological point, and one which so far no-one seems to have remarked upon, is that the derivation of Goth, namely the IE root gheud- (to pour) seems also to be the same origin as the English words &quot;gather, together&quot; and by extension &quot;good&quot;. Therefore, instead of meaning &quot;pourers of semen&quot; (an early [[kenning]], perhaps?), which has always struck me as unlikely, the word Goth might simply have started out as a self-referential word for &quot;tribe&quot;.

:[[User:Nuttyskin|Nuttyskin]] ([[User talk:Nuttyskin|talk]]) 00:53, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

::Good hypothesis though (pun was unintended, but there it is).  What people who invoke Grimm's law don't seem to understand is that BEFORE Griim's law, Goth was Got.  (And no one knows exactly the vowel sound, except it was uh or oh so Guth/Gut; Goth/Got.  The fact that some developed a lisping way of saying something (no disrespect at all intended, this is how sound shifts happen and so forth), does not mean that initially their languages were mutually unintelligible (I can still understand Cockney, Aussie or even Southern American English, more or less - sometimes with difficulty, I'll admit), does not instantly make them into a new people - nor might they have even been aware of anything more than a simple accent difference.  The root Goot, then, everyone agrees, is the pre-Grimm's law root (and not Guth or Gooth).  So what does it mean?  It could mean Good/Us/Not Bad/Not enemy, as so many words used for &quot;us folk&quot; mean.  Now, the world &quot;Folk&quot; is arguably much later (f-lk is not a well studied PIE root term like Goot).  Fulk seems to mean 'younger group' or &quot;those that are over there, not in the central place.&quot;  For some, it later means &quot;tribe&quot; as well (and becomes both a first and last name).  If it's in PIE, then of course it makes sense to check it out for cognates in Afro-Asiatic and Proto-World.  So I agree with you, but it's just you and me, with our hypotheses, among so many others.--LeValley 04:59, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

==History==
The only source for early Gothic history is [[Jordanes]]' {{Fact|date=April 2007}}''[[Getica]]'' (finished in 551 or around 1850),{{Fact|date=April 2007}} a condensation of the lost twelve-volume history of the Goths written in Italy by [[Cassiodorus]]{{Fact|date=April 2007}} around 530. Jordanes may not even have had the work at hand to consult from, and this early information should be treated with caution. Cassiodorus was well placed to write of Goths, for he was an essential minister of [[Theodoric the Great]], who apparently had heard some of the Gothic songs that told of their traditional origins.

Several historians, including [[Peter Heather]] and [[Michael Kulikowski]], argue that Jordanes' ''Getica'' presents a fictional genealogy of Theodoric and fictional history of the Goths for ancient propaganda purposes, and cast doubt on the Scandinavian origin, on the supposed royal dynasties, and on the supposed 4th-Century Kingdom of Ermaneric.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Actually Jordanes work is known only from edition of German politician and writer [[Theodore Mommsen]]. The 'Jordanes original manuscript' has been supposedly burn in Mommsen house by his elderly handicapped ancestor. The fact that nobody presented references, to any scholar mentioning Getica before 1800, doubts the document existence in older times. Also computer (n-gram) statistical algorithm, obviously ignorant of 'Mommsen Monumental Works'&lt;!-- as T.M. is frequently praised--&gt;, recognize the major text, of 'Goth language', text as Czech or Polish. Czech Prag is the place where from the [[Codex Argentus]] was forcefully taken. All the surrounding facts point to Mommsen, who was enough good Latin writer to received Noble Price in literature.

:'''Re: Codices Argenteus et al.''' there are several codices and fragments. I'm not sure whether the Argenteus was found in Praha but the Speyer fragment wasn't and other Gothic texts or fragments derive from Italy and elsewhere.

:'''Re: &quot;Goth Language&quot;''' see [[Gothic language]] for differences between Gothic and the Slavic languages. If you start reading the Gothic corpus, Grimm's Law is very noticable. Other features (the four-case system, ablaut, the two-tense system with present, preterite and the use of the verb &quot;to will&quot; to show the future and future perfect, etc.) also show ties with the Germanic languages. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 01:49, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

::Yes, and one evolved from the other (the Slavic pronunciation came first).  A sound shift does not a new people make (nor even a new language).  So, if you follow your own argument, the Goths are split off from proto-Slavic (which would explain a lot of toponymic similarities).  Indeed, if it weren't for the few sound shifts, we would be calling Germanic languages Slavic.  A very great deal was made of this in the 19th century, but this is the 21st century - and other things, such as genes, are at play as well.--LeValley 05:12, 19 March 2011 (UTC)


            High German Connection
Can anyone tell me if Gothic was spoken in what became Germany in the Dark Ages?   Its never mentionned whether it was, and Im wondering what was spoken there prior to Old High German.[[User:80.192.4.73|80.192.4.73]] 13:41, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

The indigenous population of southern Germany is believed to have spoken Celtic dialects (later probably mixed with Vulgar Latin).--[[User:Berig|Berig]] 13:46, 12 May 2007 (UTC)
::I think the confusion arises because German culture was called &quot;Gothic&quot; by the Italians in the 15th century. This was a contemptuous nickname more or less equivalent to &quot;barbarian&quot;. Recognizable Gothic probably didn't arise before the 2nd century, in the Ukraine, and was later spoken, of course, in Romania, former Yugoslavia, Italy, southern France and Spain, but never in Germany. That said, if you include Vandalic, which for all we know was practically identical to Gothic, Vandalic was spoken in what is now Poland and the Czech Republic, and spilled over into Austria and/or southern Germany before they moved forther west to France, Spain and Africa. So, if you like, Gothic (Vandalic) was spoken in souther Germany, if only for a decade or two in the early 400s.

Well, yes, yes. Some have you have discovered the ancient source problem. All the sources are like that, you know. If the discovery of a false report makes an author totally unworthy of credibility then we have no ancient history. So, some of most authors has to be discounted, but there is a method. You look for substantiation elsewhere. Right now this article is a bit one-sided; however, I will be addressing that soon. A second approach looks for falsity to be substantiated elsewhere. But what do you do then? Well, if something is shown to be wrong, you discount it. Otherwise you have no reason not to accept it. The principle is familiar to us: innocent until proven guilty. So, until someone shows me that Jordanes is wrong then I believe everything he says. If I do not then there can be no ancient history. All the mediaeval writers write the same way: first the items of tradition or belief, then what the author knows. For the earlier times, we are pretty sure no pharohs of Egypt fought it out with the Goths in the Bronze Age. The names he cites are not Germanic. It appears as though he got some Alanic names and traditions, but that is a theory that would have to be proved. A lot of Jordanes is independently verified. We are as safe as anyone in using that. I see that this is the first acquaintance of some of you with the methods and assumptions of ancient history, or indeed history. I hope that you go further; however, this is not a new field, or an unscientific one, or a hobby field where whatever anyone says goes. Jordanes is pretty standard and so pretty much is incredibility of his earliest events.

==Great Floor Mosaic==
As far as I can discover no one makes an identification of the head in the scroll of the Great Palace Mosaic with a Goth and the mosaic is not about Goths. There is nothing in it to identify any part of it as Gothic. The head is between motifs that are of hunting and is called a venator by some. Not even the chief scholar who studied it, Jobst, makes a Gothic identification. Moreover the definite dating to the time and palace of Justinian is a bit premature.

==Passage from etymology==
The number of similarities that existed between the [[Gothic language]] and [[Old Gutnish]], made the prominent linguist [[Elias Wessén]] consider Old Gutnish to be a form of Gothic.

Still, some claim that [[Gutnish language|Gutnish]] is not closer to Gothic than any other Germanic dialect.

I took this out of etymology because it has nothing at all to do with the etymology of Goth. It's not a bad summary except I've already seen parts of it in the language articles. I'm not saying it shouldn't be used but only not under etymology.

==Malplaced clause==
In the end of the '''Language''' section, this clause:
:''The Gutar (Gotlanders) themselves had oral traditions of a mass migration towards southern Europe, written down in the Gutasaga. If the facts are ''...snip...'' in the Germanic language family.''
''Firstly:'' why is this in the language section? It should be in a folklore section. ''Secondly:'' in some cases, f.ex. in the Gotlandian tell-tale &quot;sedan träsket brann&quot; (&quot;since when the lake was afire&quot;, meaning &quot;since far-far ago&quot;) regarding Fardume Träsk (the sole important lake on Gotland), the folklore have since been attested by the archeological remains of burned buildings built over the lake on pileworks, but folklore as such is a weak argument in the Gotlandian case, since the Guta Saga could as well have collected its stories from the history of the Langobards who allegedly copycated their sagacious history from the Goths, so: '''do we actually need that paragraph?'''

== Wolfram ==

Seems to me Wolfram makes three main points about the the Goths. 
1- The grave goods did not include weapons. Burial customs should be in the archeology section. But I don't have an archeological source just History of the Goths.
2- The Kingship was stronger than in most other tribes.
3- They were inclusive; that is you could join the tribe, you didn't have to be inborn. I'm not at all certain if or where these belong in this article, but it seems that the ability to easily become a Goth was an essential element of their 1,000 year history of kingdoms in areas from the Baltic to the Black Sea and finally to the Atlantic and Mediterranean.[[User:Nitpyck|Nitpyck]] ([[User talk:Nitpyck|talk]]) 19:25, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

==Gothic groups==

I suggest someone read Heather in particular about the formation of Gothic groups, which is not much dealt with in this article. Ie the Tervingi and Greuthingi were 3rd century groups, amongst others not mentioned. In the 5th century, several groups existed. Only later did the Visigoth and Ostrogoth 'supergroups' emerge after the turmoil and political re-orientation in the post-Hunnic era.

== Questions ==

If you accept the theory that the Goths originaly lived on the coast of the Baltic sea is it not safe to asume that they;

1. Had regular contact with the people of southern Sweden, who lived only a couple of days journey away by boat and who probably had incentive to trade with their southern neighbors?

2. If they had regular contact with each other and used the same name to describe themselves (or a simular name), then is it not likely that they considered themselves to be the same people?

I think that to much focus in the article and in this discussion has been put on where the Goths originated from. I mean where do the French originate from? Where do the Russians orginated from? Wouldn't it be more relevant to ask- did the Goths consider themselves to be the same as the people of southern Sweden and there maybe Jordanes can give some answeres.

==Incorrect (comment moved from top of page)==
This article is full of errors and presents old and mostly outdated academic views. The arcticle even gives the impression that the authors seek to foster a kind of Swedish nationalism (so called Swedish Gothicsism). With the actual known history of the Goths this article has very little to do. This article is beyond repair and needs to be re-written in a balanced and academically sound manner. 

The best source to base a new article on the Goths on is Michael Kulikowski's &quot;Rome's Gothic Wars&quot;, which, despite its narrow title, deals with the entire known history of the Goths.

== Mainstream scholarship is not a citation ==

&quot;Mainstream scholarship&quot; (as in textbooks published by academic presses and textbooks published for university use) do NOT agree that G^t/G^Θ comes from Sweden!  Quite the opposite.  Since the early 19th century, linguists have proposed all manner of names for the pre-PIE (now usually just called PIE, as it's being pushed back in time well before 8000BP), such as Nostratic.  But the sound sequence was already there and the toponyms of Sweden follow far more general rules than just Scandinavian or Germanic rules.--LeValley 03:55, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

== Legacy of the Goths? Removed entries ==
=== Modern cultural Goth subculture === 

 {{citations needed}} 

[[:File:Asterixcover-asterix and the goths.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asterix and the Goths]] by [[Rene Goscinny]]&lt;!--Non free file removed by DASHBot--&gt; depicted the Goths (portrayed as [[Germans]]) as militaristic barbarians.]] 

The meaning of what Goths represented or stood for is various among societies. The Goths are perceived to be both barbaric in appearance but shown intelligence to overcome a great deal of struggle and adversity, and Goths were renowned a class of skilled warriors in the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Dark Ages]] of Europe. The term &quot;Gothic&quot; came to mean dark, macabre, morbid and depressing in [[Western Europe]].

In modern times, the &quot;Goths&quot; are more known as a subculture developed by teenagers in the western world in the 1980s and 90's. Their characteristics of [[Goth subculture]] involved the formation of social cliques among each other, the choice of [[gothic fashion]]: dress is dark macabre clothing styles, applied face &quot;corpse paint&quot; makeup and dyed black hair, [[body piercing]], some spoke of a marked fascination in death and depressing topics (though a stereotype) and avid fanfare in heavy metal (esp. [[black metal]] and [[death metal]]) [[gothic rock|rock music]] songs or bands. It is unclear whether the &quot;Goth&quot; namesake is linked with knowledge in history about the Goths of ancient times unrelated to the cultural trend in the 1990s and 2000s, thus the meaning of Gothic is interpreted differently in the 21st century.

=== Gothic Ancestry and the Chilean Race myth === 
In the South American country of [[Chile]], the Goths appeared in literary work of military officer and physician [[Nicolas Palacios]] in his 1910's novel ''La Raza Chilena''. He wrote a national mythology on the origin of the [[Chilean people]], as descendants of &quot;non-Latinized&quot; (Visi)Goths in Spain, a [[martial race]] from [[Gotaland]] (Modern day southern [[Sweden]]) arrived in northern Spain in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. Their descendants the [[Spanish people]] esp. in the [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] region (formerly the province of Logrono of Castille and Leon) of Spain lived apart from their &quot;Latinized&quot; neighbors.

Palacios explained later the Spaniards of Gothic origin settled the [[Southern Cone]] of South America in the late 16th century when Chile and Argentina was a Spanish colony. They heavily intermarried with another martial race, the indigenous [[Mapuche]] to produce a [[mestizo]] Chilean race, but with (theorotic) evident [[Germanic]] characteristics, according to Palacios, found in both physiology and psychology of Chileans. His book was based on myth of Chile's racial identity relating to tales of bygone Goths of medieval Spain, but he insisted the Gothic ancestors went &quot;unmixed&quot; with [[Castilian]]s lacked evidence to be proven a fact.

== Getica is not Gothica ==

Because of Jordanes confusion between Getae and Gots, large parts of Getic and Dacian history were introduced in the history of some germanic populations. Some historic events are distorted following this confusion. Caracalla (in 214) received Geticus Maximus and Quasi Gothicus titles following battles with gets and goths. Also Belizarius received Geticus title after battles against gets.

== Goths are not Getae  ==

I corrected it again and pointed out the inconsistency of that one date (1200 CE in an article of BC's and AD's).

It was changed back to CE with the comment to look up the Wikipedia article about Common Era http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goths&amp;diff=524094952&amp;oldid=524089113

== Origins ==

Hey it is already known that the Wielbark culture is not related to the Gothic invasion. 
The link between &quot;Scanza&quot; and Black sea the Wielbark culture does not exist,because the Wielbark culture was not Gothic. Please stop speculate that Goths came from this pinky god forgotten island east of Sweden as arceologist prooved this: 

'''''However, archaeologists are wary of ascribing ethnicities to archaeological cultures, and it is considered to be an extremely difficult matter. This is reflected by the names used for the cultures, usually baptised after the towns where remains are found. The latest tendency is to doubt the equation between the Wielbark Culture and the Goths, and contemporary researchers do not believe that immigration from Scandinavia is the sole cause of the Wielbark Culture.'''''  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wielbark_culture 

The real Goths came from the east, most possible Ural mountains went south to Scythia minor and Sarmatia. They came exactly in 2-3rd centuries along with Hunnic-bulgar invasion. Maybe then in 2-3rd centuries some migrated to the north.

==Ugly as a Goth==
In my city (northern Portugal, the Germanic early settlers were the [[Suebi]], conquered by the Visigoths) we have an expression which is &quot;Feio como um gode&quot; which means &quot;Ugly as a Goth&quot;, to mean people who are very ugly as in &quot;That guy is ugly as a Goth&quot;. I always found this expression curious as people also use it naturally, not knowing who the Goths were, must be similar to Vandals (which has the meaning everybody knows), but as expected nothing is written about it. People here also call &quot;gode&quot; to round river stones.
