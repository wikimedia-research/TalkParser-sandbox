A tag has been placed on [[:Jessie Chung]] requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article, which appears to be about a real person, individual animal(s), an organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, does not indicate how or why the subject of the article is important or significant: that is, why an article about it should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the [[Wikipedia:Notability|guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]].

If you can assert the ''importance'' of the subject, [[File:Speedy delete contest button.png|link={{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:Jessie Chung}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload_A7&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}}]]. Clicking that button will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit '''[[{{TALKPAGENAME:Jessie Chung}}|the article's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. You may freely add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

See the guidelines for specific types of articles: [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|biographies]], [[WP:WEB|websites]], [[WP:BAND|bands]], or [[WP:CORP|companies]].&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 03:14, 15 October 2011 (UTC)
