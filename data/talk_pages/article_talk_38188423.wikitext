==Fiat v FIAT==
Ciao :) An interesting discovery - at least on overseas websites (e.g. http://www.fiatusa.com/en/ and http://www.fiat.com.au/), the name appears as FIAT® which is the registered trademark in capital letters only. On twitter too, they are @FIATUSA. Haven't found how or where on WP:Automobiles one can raise issues like this!

:Here, on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Automobiles|talk page of the project]]. Yes, FCA US seems to use the upper case name, but it's just on the American market. The company itself is registered as [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat Automobiles S.p.A.]]. Cheers –[[User:Cloverleaf II|Cloverleaf II]] ([[User talk:Cloverleaf II#top|talk]]) 14:14, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Alfa Romeo Mille ==

Hi,  I noticed that you renamed Alfa Mille truck&gt;ALfa Mille, howover there is other Milles also like buss, trolleybus and truck or are you going to add all to that same page ? --&lt;span style=&quot;font:bold 11px Kristen ITC;padding:0 3px 0 4px&quot;&gt;&gt;[[User:Typ932|Typ932]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Typ932|T]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Typ932|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:49, 20 March 2015 (UTC)
:No, it's back to where it was now. Careless editing on my part, I was erroneously convinced the trolleybus went under another page name. On a side note, I was pretty sure another editor had already moved it back... And in fact when I tried to undo rom the history page &quot;Edit already undone&quot; popped up! Very weird.

==[[Palazzo Barbieri]] versus Palazzo Barbieri, Verona==
I vote for leaving the title in the former fashion. While for some Palazzo Barbieri may only be linked to Verona, I for one, would not automatically make the connection, and I estimate many of the readers from the English-speaking world would not. For me it makes it easier when looking at category lists or other glimpses to assign it geographically. A minor point is that there is a second, much less impressive, Palazzo Barbieri at [[Padenghe sul Garda]].

I advocate, whenever possible, adding locale to building. For example, for most foreigners to Italy, perhaps most Italians, the church of Santa Croce may point to Florence. But there are so many Santa Croce churches in Italy.
[[User:Rococo1700|Rococo1700]] ([[User talk:Rococo1700|talk]]) 13:24, 7 June 2015 (UTC)

:I won't have a fight about it, but I disagree. Basically you're needlessly disambiguating vs. a page that does not exist, not even on it.wiki. I find ''that'' confusing. &quot;Palazzo Barbieri, Verona&quot; is redundant and inconsistent with hundreds of other articles on the wiki. In my view also it'also in conflict with a bunch of [[Wikipedia:Article titles|titling guidelines]], most notably [[WP:PRIMARYUSAGE]].
:Frankly if you maintain that all (Italian?) buildings and churches would better have their location specified in the title, you should propose a [[Wikipedia:Naming convention|naming convention]], rather than move pages one by one. —[[User:Cloverleaf II|Cloverleaf II]] ([[User talk:Cloverleaf II#top|talk]]) 15:16, 7 June 2015 (UTC)

== July 2015 ==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]. You appear to be engaged in an [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit war]] with one or more editors according to your reverts at [[:Bugatti Type 57S Atalante (57502)‎]]. Although repeatedly [[Help:Reverting|reverting or undoing]] another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the [[Wikipedia:Editing policy|normal editing process]], and often creates animosity between editors. Instead of edit warring, please discuss the situation with the editor(s) involved and try to reach a [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] on the [[:Talk:Bugatti Type 57S Atalante (57502)|talk page]].

If editors continue to revert to their preferred version they are likely to lose [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|editing privileges]]. This isn't done to punish an editor, but to prevent the disruption caused by edit warring. In particular, editors should be aware of the [[Wikipedia:Edit warring#The three-revert rule|three-revert rule]], which says that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Edit warring on Wikipedia is not acceptable in any amount, and violating the three-revert rule is very likely to lead to a [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|loss of editing privileges]].

''Deleting half of the content of an article is not an uncontroversial change. If reverted, it would then be appropriate to justify this at the article talk page: maybe some should go, likely some should stay. Simply repeating the same blanking is just edit-warring.''&lt;!-- Template:uw-ewsoft --&gt; [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 12:58, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

:[[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] I haven't repeatedly undone any edits. I undid your undoing (pardon the wordplay) just once, to bring to your attention that my edit was something more studied than simply &quot;blanking&quot; as you put it. Byte count isn't everything. Please [[Talk:Bugatti Type 57S Atalante (57502)|judge by yourself]]. —[[User:Cloverleaf II|Cloverleaf II]] ([[User talk:Cloverleaf II#top|talk]]) 13:59, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

==Lancia Appia Updates==

I used the 'thanks' button to publicly thank you (I hope you're the correct recipient); but just wanted to add kudos here.    I've been hoping for someone more competent than I was to clean up and clear up all the special Appias, especially the GT/GTS/GTE/Sport and the Vignale models.  You did a fantastic job and it shows better than the Italian Wikipedia entry now.   One question if you know:  I've seen occasional references to an Appia GTA (as opposed to GTE).  Is there such a beast?[[User:PVarjak|PVarjak]] ([[User talk:PVarjak|talk]]) 21:27, 25 August 2015 (UTC)

:Thank you very much [[User:PVarjak|PVarjak]]. Actually I was lucky in finding lots of sources on the matter, Appia Zagatos for example are quite popular—though the early ones remain quite obscure. About an Appia GTA, I've never heard of one with such a name. Perhaps it was used to refer to one of the 3-4 one-off Appias by [[Carrozzeria Allemano|Allemano]]? But that's really just conjecture! —[[User:Cloverleaf II|Cloverleaf II]] ([[User talk:Cloverleaf II#top|talk]]) 22:10, 25 August 2015 (UTC)
