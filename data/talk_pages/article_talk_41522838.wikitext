Please note that Articles for Creation is not for indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia [[WP:mainspace|mainspace]].

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/William J Cousins&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, click &quot;Save page&quot;, and an administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.
