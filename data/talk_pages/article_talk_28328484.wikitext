==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:James Billmaier]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:James Billmaier]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G4|section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a [[Wikipedia:Deletion debates|deletion debate]], {{#if:|at [[{{{2}}}]]|such as at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]}}. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:James Billmaier|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:James Billmaier|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-repost-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Christopher Connor|Christopher Connor]] ([[User talk:Christopher Connor|talk]]) 04:42, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
