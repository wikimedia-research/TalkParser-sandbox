== Copyedit ==
I did a pretty heavy copyedit on the article, reorganized a few sections, fixed a whole lot of grammar issues, and linked up the categories of games to their main articles.  Can I get another set of eyes to comb through and catch the errors that I missed and the errors I introduced? [[User:Joshua BishopRoby|Joshua BishopRoby]] 22:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

== Disambiguation == 

Seriously, this page needs to sit behind a disambiguation page. To have [[Game]] lead to a page that describes recreational activites is misleading, despite the link to a disambiguation. Surely it is logical to &quot;disambiguate&quot; instead of assuming that the readers want to know about monopoly and football.

Recreational games are just one small part of the &quot;Game&quot; concept and the lead article on the topic ought to reflect this.

:I think the concept of game is a central social idea for an encyclopedia to define. This article should attempt to broadly define &quot;What is a game?&quot; in a way that covers its broad application across english speaking society. I agree that there are many offshoots of the concept of game but I dont see disambiguation required here, was there anything you were expecting which you did not find when you came here? Maybe that can help us collectivley take this article in some new directions..  Just my two cents

===Bold reworking of introductory paragraphs===
I know this article is nominated for all this important stuff, and initially I was hesitant to edit it too much, but it felt disjointed to me and late last night the old brain started churning on this one, so Ive gone in and reworked the whole of the intro section. As always, Im happy for this to trigger a whole new wave of wikifying, but I thought if it's not flowing right then I should at least rework it even if initially people want it left fairly static?
Let me know what you think, I tried to ensure all the original points remained included but as always, lets wikify this for the better!

I deleted the link to the page &quot;table-top games&quot; because all the games were listed under other primary categories, e.g. Scrabble under letter games, Clue under board games, Mah Jong under tile-based games, etc.  I couldn't think of a class of games to justify the existence of the category.  --[[user:Fritzlein|Karl Juhnke]]

I would have expected to see an entry for 'psychological games', as described by Eric Berne in 'Games People Play' here (although the idea is possibly used more widely). Or would these be found elsewhere? I note there's a wikipedia entry for 'transactional analysis' but not AFAICS for psychological games themselves. (For all I know these ideas are now completely discredited - but that in itself shouldn't prevent an entry IMO, we have an entry about the flat earth hypothesis, for example.) -- S

The article is incomplete. Simply try to figure out a way to integrate the psychological (or transactional) definition of games in a reasonable way (I think I would create a new topic &lt;nowiki&gt;[[games (transactional)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and provide an appropriate link to it, but you do what you think is best) [[User:Fred Bauder|Fred Bauder]] 13:23 Apr 7, 2003 (UTC)

The Wittgenstein quote should be moved into the same paragraph as Kelley and away from Linhart.

== Etymology ==
There is something wrong with etymology section. There's no modern Danish word spelled &quot;gam men&quot;, I can see that’s what EB11E says. It must a misspelling because there is the word &quot;gammen&quot;, witch is not frequently used, but could very well have the same roots as the word &quot;game&quot;. I think you should remove this part until you can verify this.

== Baseball a game of chance? ==

The article says that baseball contains elements from all three classifications of games, skill, strategy, and chance, but I do not see how the game involves any element of luck or randomness.--[[User:Tubby|Tubby]] 01:02, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I would guess that was written by someone with a low opinion of baseball. Offhand I can't see where there is any more or less &quot;randomness&quot; in baseball than in football, basketball, hockey, etc. You could argue for &quot;luck&quot; in the sense of whether a player is hot or in a slump, but it still ultimately comes down to skill. [[User:Wahkeenah|Wahkeenah]] 04:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

And that's just one of many editorial opinions in the article, hence the POV tag. [[User:Wahkeenah|Wahkeenah]] 04:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

Over the course of a season, and especially over the course of a player's career, luck will even out and what is left is definitely that player's skill.  But a 0.300 hitter doesn't get exactly 3 hits in any string of 10 at bats.  He gets a bunch, then he cools off, etc.  Of course it's random.  The good hitter is going to have a 0.300 average at the end of the season and the bad hitter is going to have 0.225.  But that doesn't mean that the 0.300 hitter won't ever go 0-for-5 or that the 0.225 hitter won't ever go 5-for-5.  It happens.  That's chance. -- [[User:Gaedfu|Gaedfu]] 05:25, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

The wikilink definition of &quot;[[games of chance]]&quot; currently states that a such game is &quot;strongly influenced by some randomizing device.&quot; This could be addressed in baseball in, for instance, weather differences or umpire calls, but I don't see either of these as consistently strongly influencing the game.
It is true that baseball results are less consistent than results of other sports, but in the absence of any material &quot;device&quot; to induce randomness, it is not a game of chance.[[User:Cdcon|Cdcon]] 16:52, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

I agree with [[User:Gaedfu|Gaedfu]].  I'd like to add that attempting to hit a very fast-moving ball with a small wooden stick in a particular direction over a particular distance acts as an important randomizing device even on well-skilled individuals, as demonstrated by the low average probability that any given batter will hit a ball into play when given several (from 3 to infinity) chances, and the far lower average probability that any given batter will hit a ball in a preselected direction at a preselected angle.  The kind of prediction and psychological gameplay at work has a lot in common with poker, which (incidentally) also has a strong element of chance. [[User:Etaxier|Etaxier]] 10:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

I believe [[User:Gaedfu|Gaedfu]] and [[User:Etaxier|Etaxier]] are confusing chance with a combination of the opponents strategy and skill (i.e. the pitcher's pitch) and the player's skill (i.e. how well the batter can respond to the pitch). For a game to be without chance does not mean that one can predict the outcome of any given aspect of the play of the game. &lt;br /&gt;
As referenced earlier by [[User:Cdcon|Cdcon]], &quot;[[games of chance]]&quot; are those that are set up in the rules to include a randomizing device. The rules of baseball do not take into account any such device. A game of skill will only be as predictable as the player's skill. The skill of the player is what causes the batting average to change, not randomness. That is why a batting average is a commonly used method of determining a batter's skill. If randomness was included in the batting process then a batting average would be a useless tool for determining skill. &lt;br /&gt;
In the same way, statistics are used in an attempt to rank the skill of many teams and players in many sports with no guarantee of actual performance in any given game. Statistics is used in these cases not to rank the &quot;luck&quot; of a player or team, but rather the skill and/or strategy that they employ. Although statistics can be used in games with an element of chance, it is there to measure not the chance of the game but the skill or strategy of a player or a team. &lt;br /&gt;
Therefore since the rules of baseball do not specifically include a randomizing device as such I believe baseball as with many other sports should not be considered under games of chance. [[User:Themanieldaniel|Themanieldaniel]] 18:33, 20 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

== animal play/games ==

''Many animals play; only humans have games. The existence of rules and criteria that decide the outcome of games implies that games require intelligence of a sophistication unique to humans.''

Opens up a big irrelevant can of worms and semanticisms regarding animal intelligence. I changed it to:

''Many animals play; only humans confirmably have games. Whether some animals are intelligent enough to game is debatable, though a game has a ritualistic elements (such as rules and procedures) that are voluntarily acted upon, rather than as a result of instinct. The existence of rules and criteria that decide the outcome of games imply that games require intelligence of a significant degree of sophistication.'' [[User:JustSomeKid|JustSomeKid]] 04:54, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I removed the following &quot;It is also uncertain whether any wild animals are intelligent enough to play games.&quot;  While that statement is literally true (most everything is &quot;uncertain&quot;) it seems highly probably that chimps and dolphins have the required intelligence. I also removed the &quot;citatation needed&quot; from &quot;Domestic animals have been observed playing simpler games such as [[tag (game)|tag]], [[tug-of-war]], and [[fetch (game)|fetch]].&quot;  If you need a cite for that, find someone who has a dog and throw a ball to it.

== Definition of Games ==
&lt;Comment on the following phrase in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games#Definition Games]—''...only humans confirmably have games''.&gt;

Games are play-acting at an activity which in real life is necessary for your [[Self preservation]]. 

Examples–fishing, hunting, sports, boxing, gambling, war-games, etc. Sexual intercourse without the desire to have a child is also a game.

Proof.– The more actual the '''NEED'''; the more [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Happiness#Spinozistic_Definition_of_Joy pleasurable], the success; the more [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering#Spinozistic_Definition_of_Sorrow sorrowful], the failure.

Unless the sport is played in a vacuum, there's always chance with respect to environmental factors.

== The purpose of games ==

In games we train skills in an optimized and relatively dangerless way, before we later apply them in life. The enjoyment of games stems from the corresponding mental focus adhering to certain genetical archetypes, making their maintainance rewarding. Depending on the personality and consititution of a person, different archetypes may be active - such as a homebuilding instinct (Sims), a hunting instinct (Shooters), rise in social status (MMORPGs), strategic planning or creativity. This will determine the kinds of games the player will be interested in and stay so until he mastered the game or considers it no further masterable. It will also determine the kind of role an individual will choose preferably in society.

Obviously people are seldom consciously trying to train when playing games, but that's not required for my point either (evolution/creationism)

== sports... ==

possibly also mention that a game that involves physical activity, generally, can be referred to as a sport, with a link to the sport page. Though, the sport page has been destroyed, it seems.
:I don't have any source for this, but it's my own personal definition: If you could participate in the activity via a proxy (you can tell someone else exactly how to make your moves and you are still considered the player) then it's a '''game'''.  If, in such a setup, your proxy would be considered the player and not you, then it's a '''sport'''.  
:Examples: In [[Bridge]], you could tell a proxy how to bid and what cards to play.  It would still be your thought behind the moves, so it would be you playing.  Bridge is a game. In [[Tiddlywinks]], however, even if you coach your proxy on where to put the pieces and how to flip them, it's still not your dexterity getting the job done.  Your proxy is the player. Therefore, Tiddly-winks is a sport. [[User:Applejuicefool|Applejuicefool]] 21:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

==Revamp==
I think the structure of the article was slightly off. We should concentrate more effort to the core element of game. In my view, the definition followed by tool, social context and gameplay is better overall structure. Sport and Computer Game do deserve separate section due to its significance but only after the article explained the elements of the game. I'm also not sure &quot;animal section&quot; deserve a section. It doesn't have any reference to begin with. Moreover, I don't know the information has a relevance. IMO, single player game can be reincorporated into social context section. [[User:Vapour|Vapour]]

My main idea is that previous arrangement was bit too biased in term of antholopology. Don't get me wrong. It's a valid POV and certainly deserve it's own section. However, i think gameplay element (rule, tool, environment, chance) is somewhat much closer to the core of what game is. [[User:Vapour|Vapour]]

==Anthropology of Games 2: Unsourced &amp; Unlikely==
The 1st para of &quot;Anthropology&quot; lacks sources and seems implausible to boot. Specifically:
* Games are intimately connected to culture. ''This is a meaningless sentence''
* Tag is associated with hunting. ''No. It occurs spontaneously among children in non-hunting cultures, e.g. modern American suburbs''
* The historical popularity of ballgame in Europe is associated with their familiarity with leather. ''So baseball comes from timber-using cultures and football from timber-poor cultures?'' 
* Many martial culture practiced wrestling ''As do many non-martial cultures. Actually, what is meant by 'martial culture'? 
* Golf originated by a shepard in Scotish highland and maintains its associations with broad, flat stretches of grassland. ''Scots highlands are not noted for broad, flat stretches of grass''
I would strike the entire paragraph unless it can be sourced.  [[User:Rewinn|rewinn]] 03:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

With &quot;tag is associated with hunting,&quot; it makes more sense to fix the statement than discard it.  Just add the word &quot;instinct&quot;:  Tag is associated with the hunting instinct.  That takes care of children playing tag in non-hunting cultures... [[User:Etaxier|Etaxier]] 10:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

== Chinese Numbers? ==
I was rooting through the list  of types of games and I was wondering if someone could help me in defining a particular game and what category it would fall under. The game is called chinese numbers and in the game you have one person running the game and undefined number of people playing. The person running the game places several objects togather in what looks like a predetermined way (in reality any way they want, anything will work) they than ask the group what number this is. The players will look at the object and try to figure out what number it is. The number is actually irrevelant of the object and is determined by the number of words the leader uses when he asks what number it is. An example. 

Question:-What number is this?- Answer: 4
Question:-Which number is this on the table?- Answer: 7

The goal is to figure it out, and then watch your friends be tormented that they dont know the answer. If anyone could help me figure out what category this falls under it would be great, so I can learn more about other games like this and help expand it.

==Problem with language games and Wittgenstein reference?==

The piece includes:
&quot;He subsequently argued that the concept &quot;game&quot; could not be contained by any single definition, but that games must be looked at as a series of definitions that share a &quot;family resemblance&quot; to one another.&quot;

In the first place LW did not hold that concepts were &quot;contained in&quot; definitions. This language suggests a metaphysics nowhere present in LW's body of work.

In the second place it was not part of LW's approach to tell us how things &quot;must be looked at.&quot; Rather he suggested that we (in this sort of context) look at the ways in which words are actually and usefully applied.

Finally, nowhere did Wittgenstein argue nor in any way suggest that games: &quot;be looked at as a series of definitions&quot; that share a family resemblance. I hope this was just careless composition. 

Chess is not a series of definitions, nor is baseball, nor is naughts and crosses, nor is Grand Theft Auto. There is no evidence that Wittgenstein was confused about this.


Therefore...

== Some remarks ==

There were some things in this article I couldn't really agree on.

First of all,  I doubt tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy. I even doubt it is a game. Doesn't one of the definitions require an uncertain outcome? To me and to any person with some logical skill whatsoever, tic-tac-toe is more like a performance of a sequence of moves, very short and always the same.

19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)[[User:Wikiwikinom|Wikiwikinom]] ([[User talk:Wikiwikinom|talk]])
Tic-tac-toe is a game from which children derive hours of amusement. 

The sentence above is intelligible to any speaker of English. That is to say that, in it, familiar words are being used in familiar ways. I suggest it would be considered to present a true proposition by anyone familiar with the lexical sense and common usage of the word game, as long as they were also familiar with children.

I suggest that you are presenting a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasive_definition of &quot;game&quot; which narrows the scope of the term to a range which excludes much which common usage and prevelant lexical definitions include.

19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)[[User:Wikiwikinom|Wikiwikinom]] ([[User talk:Wikiwikinom|talk]]) 19:04, 6 April 2010 (UTC)

On the other hand, I don't think Paper, Rock and Scissors is just a chance game. Maybe not at all. There is no chance element like a die or scrambled cards. Of course you don't know for sure what your opponent is going to do, but that applies to chess too, and that's definitely not a game of chance. To me, PR&amp;S is about getting to know your opponents preferences, predicting his or her choice by facial expression and outcome of previous rounds and the like.

The article states that &quot;the concept of fandom began with sports fans&quot;. How can we be so sure? Don't the followers of ancient prophets, gods, famous entertainers or generals qualify as fans? 

And finally, I don't quite understand from the definitions, what exactly is the difference between a game and living normal, conformist, everyday life?

[[User:Junuxx|Junuxx]] ([[User talk:Junuxx|talk]]) 14:04, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game taught to children.  It is an excellent early step in showing how some games (and life) cannot be won. It is also a useful stage in showing how changing the rules -eg to three pegs only which can move - makes it a new game (called 3 mans morris).  

I agree that PRS is not a game of chance.  

Fandom is of course equal to any charismatic crowd but the word 'fan' ?began with US sports.

[[Game]] is the top article, below which come [[Tabletop game]] thence [[Board games]] and onwards come many sub-categories and articles. 

There is '''unhelpful slippage between articles'''.  For example [[Game]] details some 12 types of game as follows (at Sept 2008) :-

[[Sports]] (with [[Lawn game]]s as a sub-section);  

[[Table game]]s with [[Board games]], [[Card games]], [[Dice games]], [[Miniature games]], [[Paper and pencil games]], and [[roleplaying games]] as sub-sections;  

Note 1 ''There is a recent casino-based intervention that Table games are a variant of casino games as opposed to 'slots'.'' 

Note 2 ''Pencil and paper games do not appear to be table games according to the definition used for tabel games.  Dice games do not necessarily need a table.'' 
[[Video games]] with Arcade, Computer, Console, Hand-held, Mobile and Online sub-sections.

'''However, Game links to '[[List of types of games]]' which divides into Sports, Table games, Video Games and Others in a significantly different arrangement than in the header article. ''' 

The sub-group 'Others' is an amalgam of items.  Wargames surely should be with miniatures and role-playing.  There are others which, provided they use a '''board''' on a '''table''', come within the sub-section of board-games called 'abstract' 
- - - - - - 

Furthermore, [[List of basic game topics]] under 'Types of games' has yet another different arrangement. It also notes 'for a more comprehensive list' see [[Game Classification]]'.

- - - - - - - - -

Categories used by popular game sites such as BoardGameGeek should be considered if any effort is made to regularise these categories. It may be that a multi-layer categorisation should be considered.  

Thus &quot;two player only games, three-player only; two or more players;&quot; and so on might be one such layering. 

The equipment requirements could be another with board, computer, ball, dice, domino, string etc being a second.

== Mahjong not a domino game ==

The typical western domino is double ended and thus unlike a mahjong tile. Mahjong merely has a tile which is hard, solid and sometimes made of bone (I refrain from the obvious joke).  In play and style, Mahjong is a card game correctly described as being 'rummy'-like. If there is consensus on this change?

:It's rummy-like, but I think the consensus here is to call it a [[tile-based game]], rather than card game. [[User:Percy Snoodle|Percy Snoodle]] ([[User talk:Percy Snoodle|talk]]) 19:00, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

:: Dominoes are defined as double-ended pieces with a dividing line. I see no resemblance to a Mahjongg tile and therefore, as yet, no debate as to consensus. [[User:Salisbury-99|Salisbury-99]] ([[User talk:Salisbury-99|talk]]) 10:19, 11 October 2008 (UTC)
:::I think you misunderstood.  Dominoes is a tile-based game.  Not all tile-based games are domino games.  Mahjongg is a tile-based game.  Mahjongg is not a domino game.  What's to debate?  [[User:Percy Snoodle|Percy Snoodle]] ([[User talk:Percy Snoodle|talk]]) 10:21, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

== What about ballroom dancing? ==

The main article, as it now stands, begins:

''A game is a structured activity, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more concerned with the expression of ideas.''

From this, it would seem that ballroom dancing is a &quot;game&quot;. [[Special:Contributions/76.208.248.98|76.208.248.98]] ([[User talk:76.208.248.98|talk]]) 06:10, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

:The next sentence is ''&quot;However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be...&quot;'' - the whole lead gives a rough definition. There's no need to try to make the opening sentence 100% watertight in isolation. --[[User:McGeddon|McGeddon]] ([[User talk:McGeddon|talk]]) 09:10, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

==Definition==
I don't have access to the main page, and I was wondering if anyone out there could add the definition of a game from [[Jesse Schell]]'s of The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses.
&quot;A game is a problem-solving activity approached with a playful attitude.&quot;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.219.190.87|98.219.190.87]] ([[User talk:98.219.190.87|talk]]) 16:25, 21 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Art: Expression of ideas?==
I can't edit the main &quot;Game&quot; page for some reason, but the first line offers a naive definition of &quot;art&quot;, which is contradicted on the very page that the word&quot;art&quot; links to. Anyone up for coming up with a better first sentence/paragraph?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.52.129.253|173.52.129.253]] ([[User talk:173.52.129.253|talk]]) 01:28, 18 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Thanks Rjanag - sorry, didn't realize contributions to the talk page were meant to be appended to the bottom! Anyway, the definition of art on the general &quot;art&quot; page for wikipedia claims &quot;Art is the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way to affect the senses or emotions&quot;. Here's part of the first sentence on the &quot;game&quot; page: &quot;art, which is more concerned with the expression of ideas&quot;.

Focusing on emotions or senses as opposed to &quot;ideas&quot; is a more inclusive definition that allows us to include abstract art, dance and music (and maybe even games, although lets not open that can of worms right now). Anyway, it might seem like a subtle difference but it happens to be something that (video) game community is struggling with right now, which is why I bothered to write this!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.52.129.253|173.52.129.253]] ([[User talk:173.52.129.253|talk]]) 01:48, 19 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Edit request from Dawitwiki, 17 November 2010 ==

{{tl|edit semi-protected}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
I don't think the first item for a definition of a game should be Ludwig Wittgenstein's &quot;use&quot; of the word &quot;game&quot;. Wittgenstein's use of a game should rather be discussed as an EXCEPTION  to ''a'' definition of a game. Wittgenstein's use of the word &quot;game&quot; is not to show that &quot;game&quot;, as we know it, is indefinable. He does NOT offer a definition of the word &quot;game&quot; nor does he intend to define it. It will rather be absurd and oxymoronic to cite him first under &quot;Definition&quot;. My suggestion is that you remove his name from this entry unless of course you are using him to explain &quot;family resemblances&quot; and the problem of defining things, including &quot;games&quot;,  in GENERAL.

== animals and games? ==

Many animals engage in activities that might be considered 'games' with each other or toys, especially in their younger age. Should it be mentioned in a article? [[Special:Contributions/95.58.139.97|95.58.139.97]] ([[User talk:95.58.139.97|talk]]) 14:27, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
:If it is notable enough to be supported by [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], go ahead. However, just because young animals' activities are similar to what humans would consider &quot;playing&quot;, it doesn't mean it is anything close to what is the subject of the article. Your phrase &quot;might be considered&quot; is a strong clue against the inclusion of this information. If we included it in this form, it would quickly be dismissed as [[WP:OR|original research]] -- [[User:Nczempin|Nczempin]] ([[User talk:Nczempin|talk]]) 17:25, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

== Proposing an improved definition ==

I'd like to propose an improved definition, one that I sincerely believe is definitive, as opposed to merely descriptive:
Game: An activity in which achievement of a goal is challenged by motion, obfuscation, chance, or the actions of opponents.
This definition is the result of a careful analysis and I really think it precisely identifies the sufficient and necessary conditions for something to qualify as a game.

== &quot;Sexual games&quot; ==

'...redirects here.'' See, this is why wikipedia, otherwise most worthy project, is not recommended to children. I am pretty convinced a lot of children might type this article name in. And I doubt most people looking for [[Game]] care that [[Sexual Game]] reditects here. So why is that information in the second sentence? Actually why is it even there, when I never expressed interest in it with my query? Well, I do know why, everybody knows. That's sick, really. 01:27, 16 February 2014 (UTC)[[Special:Contributions/94.78.131.202|94.78.131.202]] ([[User talk:94.78.131.202|talk]])
: I don't think Wikipedia has a policy for being children-friendly. However, I removed that redirection note since this article does not contain anything related to that topic anyway. I personally think a &quot;sexual game&quot; is not really a game, and thus should be in its own article instead.
