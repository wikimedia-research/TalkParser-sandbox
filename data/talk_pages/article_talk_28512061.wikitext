Regarding [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Suero_de_Qui%C3%B1ones&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=353041418&amp;oldid=353000322 this] edit by [[User:Srnec]]. The ''Libro del Passo honroso'' is a very old text, the footnote is a reference to one version of the text, a reprint, which was published in 1930 and that edition reprinted in 1977. The  Riquer, Martín de text is a general reference for the article. The article is not perfect, it needs more footnotes etc.. I didn't write it, but there is no &quot;factual accuracy&quot; problem.
