[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|alt=|link=]]&lt;!-- use [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]] for YELLOW flag --&gt;A tag has been placed on your user page, [[:User:Pduffer]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|section G11]] of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to be blatant advertising which only promotes or publicises a company, product, group or service, and which is a violation of our policies regarding acceptable use of user pages; user pages are intended for active '''editors''' of Wikipedia to communicate with one another as part of the process of creating encyclopedic content, and should not be mistaken for [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#WEBHOST|free webhosting resources]]. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]], [[Wikipedia:User pages|the guidelines on user pages]], and, especially, our [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations|FAQ for Organizations]]. 

If you can indicate why the page is not blatant advertising, contest the deletion by clicking on the button that looks like this: {{button|Click here to contest this speedy deletion}} which appears inside of the speedy deletion (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{db-...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy deletion candidate). Doing so will take you to your user talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also edit this page directly to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would help make it encyclopedic. Feel free to leave a note on [[User talk:Clubjustin4|my talk page]] if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn-userpage --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Clubjustin4|Clubjustin3]] ([[User talk:Clubjustin4|talk]]) 14:43, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Wikipedia is not for writing about yourself ==
Mr Duffer, welcome to Wikipedia, but it is not a place like Facebook or LinkedIn for people to write about themselves. It is a quite different sort of site, a project to build an [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]], so it is [[WP:N|selective]] about subjects for articles, and writing about oneself is ''strongly'' discouraged, for reasons explained at [[WP:Wikipedia is not about YOU|Wikipedia is not about YOU]] and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography]].

Wikipedia user pages are not like those at social-networking sites. Their use is explained at [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]] have their own [[Wikipedia:User page|user pages]], but they should be used primarily to present information relevant to working on the encyclopedia. [[WP:UPYES|Limited biographical information]] is allowed, but user pages should not function as personal webpages or be repositories for large amounts of material that is irrelevant to collaborating on Wikipedia. If you are looking to make a personal webpage or [[blog]] or to post your résumé, please make use of one of the many free providers on the Internet or any hosting included with your Internet account.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You can find out more about Wikipedia at the [[WP:Welcome]] page and the [[WP:Introduction]]. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 15:09, 17 March 2015 (UTC)
