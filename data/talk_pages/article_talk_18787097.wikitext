===Your edits to [[August 10]]===
Dear [[User:90.197.133.74|90.197.133.74]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px]]
Some of your [{{fullurl:August 10|diff=230861507&amp;oldid=230846614}} edits] on the page 
[[August 10]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: No Wikipedia page has been linked to.
If a Wikipedia page for the person already exists, add a link to it (by putting it in doubled square brackets &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Like this]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you [[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-PseudoBot1 --&gt; [[User:PseudoBot|PseudoBot]] ([[User talk:PseudoBot|talk]]) 19:02, 9 August 2008 (UTC)
