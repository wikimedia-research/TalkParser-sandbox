== Welcome! ==

Hello, KZand, and [[Project:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/KZand|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Kamran Zand]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may not be retained. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''.

Or, you can just type '''{{tl|help me}}''' on this page, followed by your question, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Kamran Zand]]==
[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Kamran Zand]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Kamran Zand|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Largoplazo|—Largo Plazo]] ([[User talk:Largoplazo|talk]]) 22:53, 22 April 2015 (UTC)

== April 2015 ==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not write or add to an article about yourself. Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiography]] is ''strongly'' discouraged – see our guideline on [[WP:AUTOBIO|writing autobiographies]]. If you create such an article, it may be deleted. If what you have done in life is genuinely notable and can be verified according to our policy for [[WP:PEOPLE|articles about living people]], someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles|Wikipedians with articles]]). If you wish to add to an existing article about yourself, please propose the changes on its talk page. Please understand that this is an encyclopedia and not a personal web space or social networking site. If your article has already been deleted, please see: [[Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?|Why was my page deleted?]], and if you feel the deletion was an error, please discuss it with the deleting administrator. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Largoplazo|—Largo Plazo]] ([[User talk:Largoplazo|talk]]) 22:54, 22 April 2015 (UTC)

[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|25px]] Please do not use Wikipedia to promote businesses. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia is not]] the ''[[Yellow pages]]''. If you want to list a company for potential customers to find, please consider [[WP:alternative outlets#Directory of alternatives|alternative outlets]]. Thank you.

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended for publicity and/or promotional purposes. If you intend to edit constructively in other topic areas, you ''may'' be granted the right to continue under a change of username. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; margin-top:15px&quot;&gt;
;Why can't I edit Wikipedia?
[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or [[Special:MyPage|username]] indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, website or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[Wikipedia:Spam#External link spamming|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:Spam|posting advertisements]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on [[:Category:Companies|companies]], groups, and [[:Category:Organizations|organizations]], but such groups are generally discouraged from using Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Promotional names|username policy]].
&lt;/div&gt;

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not, although if you can demonstrate a pattern of future editing in strict accordance with our [[Wikipedia:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy, you ''may'' be granted this right.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organizations|Wikipedia's FAQ for Organizations]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, organization, or clients. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit Wikipedia again.

;What can I do now?

If you have no interest in writing about some other topic than your organization, group, company, or product, you may consider using [[WP:Alternative outlets|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead. 
 
If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions here about some other topic, you must convince a [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include &quot;tlx or the first | character&quot;. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
**Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
**Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, you may [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block|appeal this block]] by adding the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock|Your reason here}} below, but you should read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks|guide to appealing blocks]] first. &lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z17}}&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt; [[User:Just Chilling|Just Chilling]] ([[User talk:Just Chilling|talk]]) 23:05, 22 April 2015 (UTC)
