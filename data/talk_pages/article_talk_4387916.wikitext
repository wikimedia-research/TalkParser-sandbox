==Move the article? and more==

After writing up the entry I noticed that it's listed solely as &quot;Establishment&quot; rather than &quot;The Establishment.&quot; I'm wondering whether it should moved or...?

Also, depending on what happens with moving it, it needs to be added to the disambuguation page for [[establishment]]. 

Annnd.. I'm a little sketchy on how to go about adding it to a category as well.

It works like this, I wouldn't worry about moving. I added it to the disambiguation page and all links work right now. Anyway good work on starting this page. 

As for categories, the best way seems to be to search for a topic that is very similar to the one you are working on (for the Establishment, that would be the Authority or Stormwatch for instance) and just copy the categories from there. [[User:Dizzy D|Dizzy D]] 11:36, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

==Fair use rationale for Image:Establish13.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Establish13.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Establish13.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;
