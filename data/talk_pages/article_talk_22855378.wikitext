== Tips for developing country outlines ==
Instructions for developing country outlines is located at [[Wikipedia:Outlines]] (while that section is complete, the page is a draft, and will be moved to the Wikipedia namespace when completed). ''[[User talk:The Transhumanist|The Transhumanist]]'' 21:45, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

== A note concerning redlinks... ==
Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry. Instead, complete it with &quot;none&quot; (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, &quot;- x is a landlocked country with no ports&quot;). If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location. See [[Wikipedia:Redirect]], [[WP:Section linking]], and [[Help:Section#Section_linking]].

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands. This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible. So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually. In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any. See [[Wikipedia:Redirect]], [[WP:Section linking]], and [[Help:Section#Section_linking]].

Thank you.

== Please check and fix the government section ==
The government section needs to be checked for accuracy. The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template, and the data didn't fit all countries.

So those sections need to be looked over, and fixed if needed.

Please help.

Thank you.

== Needed maintenance on country outlines ==

Please check this outline for the following problems, and fix if present:

* If the Local government section is empty (or only has a red &quot;main&quot; link), please remove the section. (If it has a blue &quot;main&quot; link, do not remove).
* Underdeveloped Education section - add more links.
* Redlinks that are unlikely to ever turn blue - remove or delink as appropriate.
* Out-of-date incumbant names - remove. No need to add the new incumbants, as the links to the articles on the position titles should suffice.

Thank you. [[User talk:The Transhumanist|&lt;i&gt;The Transhumanist&lt;/i&gt;]] 03:45, 8 August 2013 (UTC)

== Quick explanation of Wikipedia outlines ==

&quot;[[Outline (list)|Outline]]&quot; is short for &quot;hierarchical outline&quot;. There are two types of outlines: sentence outlines (like those you made in school to plan a paper), and topic outlines (like the topical synopses that professors hand out at the beginning of a college course). Outlines on Wikipedia are primarily topic outlines that serve 2 main purposes: they provide taxonomical classification of subjects showing what topics belong to a subject and how they are related to each other (via their placement in the [[tree structure]]), and as subject-based tables of contents linked to topics in the encyclopedia. The hierarchy is maintained through the use of heading levels and indented bullets. See [[Wikipedia:Outlines]] for a more in-depth explanation.
