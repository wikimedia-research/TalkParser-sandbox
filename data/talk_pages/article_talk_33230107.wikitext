Please do not make [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|articles about a living person]] that are entirely negative in tone and unsourced. Wikipedia has a policy of [[WP:V|verifiability]] and any negative information we use must be [[WP:RS|reliably sourced]], and our articles must be [[WP:NPOV|balanced]]. Negative unreferenced biographies of living people '''are not tolerated''' by Wikipedia and are [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]]. Users who continue to create or repost such pages and images in violation of our [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|biographies of living persons]] policy will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. Thank you. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Joshua James Brooks|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-negublp-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Alpha Quadrant|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000070; font-family: Times New Roman&quot;&gt;''Alpha Quadrant''&lt;/span&gt;]]  [[User talk:Alpha Quadrant|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00680B; font-family: Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]   16:11, 27 September 2011 (UTC)
