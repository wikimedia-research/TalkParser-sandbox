'''Phil Blake isn't English'''&lt;br&gt;
Why does Phil Blake have an English flag next to his name? Sure he was born in England but moved to Australia as a child and played for Australia as a schoolboy, and coached the many top level clubs in Union and League as an adult, including the Australian Wallabies. He is Australian and should be represented as such here. [[Special:Contributions/58.168.42.219|58.168.42.219]] ([[User talk:58.168.42.219|talk]]) 04:59, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
