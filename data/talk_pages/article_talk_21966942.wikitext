==Pending changes==
This article is one of a  number (about 100) selected for the early stage of the trial of the [[Wikipedia:Pending Changes]] system on the English language Wikipedia. All the articles listed at [[Wikipedia:Pending changes/Queue ]]  are being considered for level 1 pending changes protection.

The following request appears on that page:

{{Mbox|text=Many of the articles were selected semi-automatically from a list of indefinitely semi-protected articles.&lt;br /&gt;Please confirm that the protection level appears to be still warranted, and consider unprotecting instead, before applying pending changes protection to the article.}}

Comments on the suitability of theis page for &quot;Penfding changes&quot;  would be appreciated.

Please update the [[Wikipedia:Pending changes/Queue|Queue]] page as appropriate.

Note that I am not involved in this project any much more than any other editor, just posting these notes since it is quite a big change, potentially
