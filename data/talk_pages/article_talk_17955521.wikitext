Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome to Wikipedia]]!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Username policy|username policy]]{{#if:|&amp;#32;for the following reason: {{{1}}}}}. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
* If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
* If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes|dispute resolution process]], such as [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names|requesting comments]] from other Wikipedians.  [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Wikipedia administrators]] usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
* You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit [[Wikipedia:Changing username]] and follow the guidelines there.

{{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}  &lt;!-- Template:uw-username --&gt; [[User:Dave1185|Dave1185]] ([[User talk:Dave1185|talk]]) 16:34, 15 June 2008 (UTC)
