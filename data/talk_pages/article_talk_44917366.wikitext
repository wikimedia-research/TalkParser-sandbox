[[:Demographics of Peja]] → {{no redirect|Demographics of Peć}} – Consistency with main original article Peć '''&lt;font face=&quot;Perpetua&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;[[User:Anastan|&lt;font color=&quot;#1E90FF&quot;&gt;Ąnαșταη&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Anastan|&lt;font color=&quot;#1E90FF&quot;&gt;ταlκ&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt;''' 14:22, 24 December 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' because it's consistent with the main article (as described). Also, as stated in the other discussion about this, both Peć and Pejë/Peja are considered official, although Peć appears to be the one that's established itself in English, just like we say [[Kiev]] and [[Gothenburg]] instead of Kyiv and Göteborg. - [[User:Anonimski|Anonimski]] ([[User talk:Anonimski|talk]]) 16:22, 24 December 2014 (UTC)
