== Getting contact info for prospective Wikipedia Club ==

Hi Matt, it was nice meeting you at the Campus Ambassador training. Could I get you to [[Special:Emailuser/Dcoetzee|e-mail me]] your e-mail address? I'm thinking of setting up a mailing list for the prospective Wikipedia Club, because one of my goals is to recruit more new users interested in trying out Wikipedia so I'd like to have some kind of off-wiki communication to facilitate that. Let me know your thoughts. Good luck with your class! [[User:Dcoetzee|Dcoetzee]] 02:32, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

==Tea in my eyes and on my face...but thanks anyway!==


Matt, I just thanked Sage for the cup-o-tea, and got corrected. I actually did see your name there, but was writing to him about something else and got my wires crossed. Much on the plate just now. But, hey, I have now some tea to wash it down with, so, no problem! Thanks for the appreciation. Hope things are going swimmingly on YOUR end of the universe...

== Ambassador Program: assessment drive ==

Even though it's been quiet on-wiki, the Wikipedia Ambassador Program has been busy over the last few months getting ready for the next term. We're heading toward over 80 classes in the US, across all disciplines.  You'll see courses start popping up [[Wikipedia:Ambassadors/Courses#2011_Q3_.28upcoming.29|here]], and this time we want to match one or more Online Ambassadors to each class based on interest or expertise in the subject matter. If you see a class that you're interested, please contact the professor and/or me; the sooner the Ambassadors and professors get in communication, the better things go. Look for more in the coming weeks about next term.

In the meantime, with a little help I've identified [[User:Sross (Public_Policy)/Courses/Articles|all the articles students did significant work on in the last term]].  Many of the articles have never been assessed, or have ratings that are out of date from before the students improved them.  '''Please help assess them!'''  Pick a class, or just a few articles, and give them a rating (and add a relevant WikiProject banner if there isn't one), and then update the list of articles.

Once we have updated assessments for all these articles, we can get a better idea of how quality varied from course to course, and which approaches to running Wikipedia assignments and managing courses are most effective.

== OA ≠ OA publishing and green OA is not a form of publishing ==

Only gold OA publishing is a form of publishing. Green OA self-archiving is definitely not a form of publishing. Publishing is something a publisher does. Self-archiving is done by the author, not the publisher. A green publisher is not an OA publisher but a non-OA publisher that has given its authors the green light to self-archive. If the publisher makes the articles OA, it's an OA (gold) publisher.

Conflating OA with gold OA, and misdescribing green OA as a &quot;form of publishing&quot; is the single most widespread and persistent misunderstanding about OA; Peter Suber and I have been trying to correct it for years, but it just keeps popping up, because people find it so much easier to think of OA as a publishing matter: It's not. It's an access matter. If authors provide the access, publishing has not changed; only accessibility has changed.  '''[[User:harnad|harnad]]''' ([[User talk:harnad|talk]]) [[Stevan Harnad]] 03:53, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

:Harnad, thanks for posting the message. I understand and agree. I did not intend to suggest green OA is a ''form'' of publishing. Perhaps my thoughts are best phrased as a question. Gratis/Libre OA describes the licensing qualities of &quot;access&quot; but not necessarily the &quot;materials,&quot; though it is fair to extend &quot;Gratis/Libre&quot; to the materials themselves (a &quot;libre journal article&quot; uses a copyleft license). On the other hand, Green/Gold describes the ways the material are made accessible (Jeffrey even says &quot;OA can be '''delivered''' in two ways:&quot;), but this does not extend logically to the material itself (I would not say a &quot;green journal article&quot;), correct? This is the ambiguity I was trying to resolve. It's easy to misinterpret &quot;OA&quot; to mean the material itself, is there a way to be more clear? Lastly, it seems to me there is an additional layer of nuance in how journals adopt Green/Gold methods as policies. [[User:Mattsenate|Mattsenate]] ([[User talk:Mattsenate#top|talk]]) 04:23, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

::Matt, what you wrote was &quot;There are at least two methods [[academic journals]] use to provide open access&quot;: This is incorrect because there is only one &quot;method,&quot; namely, to make the item free online. The difference is that with [[gold OA]], it is the publisher that makes it free online, and with [[green OA]] it is the author.

::Yes, there are further nuances (and these are described further in the [[Open access]] entry. The difference between [[Gratis versus libre]] OA (in the special case of OA, unlike the case of, say, [[Open software]]) is not a difference in license, but just a difference in degree. A gratis OA article is merely freely accessible online. A libre OA article is both freely accessible online (i.e., gratis) and in addition has certain further re-use rights (there is some scope for variation in which rights are specified). Yes, libre OA is often indicated in the form of a [[CC license]], but gratis OA usually is not. The article is simply made free online by the author. In the case of &quot;green&quot; publishers -- n.b., not &quot;Green OA publishers,&quot; because there is no such thing: an OA publisher is a gold OA publisher -- in the case of &quot;green&quot; ''publishers'', they have formally endorsed their author's right to make their articles green OA by self-archiving them immediately upon acceptance for publication. This endorsement usually does not take the form of a &quot;license,&quot; but merely a formal statement by the publisher, or a clause in the author/publisher copyright transfer agreement. (A CC license is not between author and publisher but between author and user or between publisher and user.) See [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]] RoMEO.

::Further nuances on gratis green OA include ''which version'' is made OA: The version with the fewest publisher restrictions is the author's final, refereed, revised draft, immediately upon acceptance for publication. That is the version for which most green publishers endorse author self-archiving, not the publisher's proprietary version-of-record. Hence that is the default option for gratis green OA. (There are also further nuances as to ''where'' the article may be made [[Green OA]]: the author's [[institutional repository]] or a &quot;central,&quot; institution-external repository. These further distinctions begin to get rather silly, considering the nature of free online access and the nature of the web, but there you are.)

::About differences between &quot;OA publishers&quot; and &quot;OA articles,&quot; see &quot;'''OA means free (and permanent) online access immediately upon publication'''&quot; in [[Talk:Open_access]]. Being an OA article is a state, whereas being an OA publisher is a trait... 

:: Hope this helps. '''[[User:harnad|harnad]]''' ([[User talk:harnad|talk]])  [[Stevan Harnad]] 12:15, 22 September 2011 (UTC)
:::Aha, I think I realized what I was trying to say before. I'd like to make the lead paragraph more accessible and clear for a general encyclopedic audience. Is there a way to more briefly and summarily state the green/gold access definition, and include a more substantive, but clear discussion below it? I'd like to help improve the structure of the article overall. I'm happy to start moving these thoughts to the discussion page of the article.

==question==
Hi Matt,
I just completed making revisions and adding new content to a wiki page on my sandbox. I requested to have my sandbox page moved to the wiki page, but the request was denied. It was suggested that I should integrate my changes to the current page. I was wondering how I should go about doing this. Should I just delete what's on the current page and paste the content of my sandbox there. I've already integrated the content of the wikipage onto my sandbox.

== Wikipedia Open Access, PLoS, GLAM and the BHL ==

Hi Matt,

Sorry, I didn't see your messages on #wikimedia-us until just now, just after you left! I don't know if you've seen [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Open Access]]; [[User:Daniel Mietchen]], who recently facilitated [http://wir.okfn.org/2012/03/29/plos-computational-biology-goes-wiki/ a really fantastic project] between PLoS Computational Biology and Wikipedia. If you work at PLoS, you should definitely think about getting involved with [[WP:GLAM/US|the US GLAM initiative]]: I'm going to be summer-interning at the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]], another virtual library, and I'm [[commons:COM:BHL|hoping to draw them into the Wikipedia orbit]] with a lot of help from GLAM-WIKI.

Anyway, I mostly wanted to pass these links on to you. Let me know -- on or [http://www.ggvaidya.com/contact-me.html off Wikipedia] -- if I can help in any way with bringing about more Open Access linkups on Wikipedia!

cheers,

:Thanks Gaurav, this stuff is great. I'm surprised I haven't heard about PLoS Computational Biology's WP project, it looks awesome. I'll touch base with some folks at the office tomorrow and see what's going on. Further, I agree there's an opportunity to work with the GLAM initiative, though Plos is neither a library nor an archive, it's really an academic publisher. But the content is CC-BY so there should be more stuff to do like what Plos CompBiol is up to!

==Invitation to wikiFeed==
Hello Mattsenate,

I'm part of a team that is researching ways to help Wikipedia editors find interesting content to contribute to Wikipedia. More specifically, we are investigating whether content from news sources can be used to enhance Wikipedia editing. We have created a tool, called wikiFeed, that allows you to specify Twitter and/or RSS feeds from news sources that are interesting to you. wikiFeed then helps you make connections between those feeds and Wikipedia articles. We believe that using this tool may be a lot of fun, and may help you come up with some ideas on how to contribute to Wikipedia in ways that interest you. Please participate! To do so, complete this [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NGLC3X5 survey] and follow this [https://wikistudy.mathcs.carleton.edu link] to our website. Once you're there, click the &quot;create an account&quot; link to get started.

For more information about wikiFeed, visit our [[meta:Research:Using information sources to drive contributions to Wikipedia|project page]]. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask via my talk page, or by email at wikifeedcc@gmail.com. We appreciate your time and hope you enjoy playing with wikiFeed!

== Greetings from WikiProject Open Access ==

Dear Matt,
[[File:Gamma phage.png|thumb|120px|[[SEM]] of [[bacteriophages]].]]
it is now one year since [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Open Access|WikiProject Open Access]] was started by [[User:Bluerasberry]] on January 10, 2012. Since then, the project has advanced modestly, but we have not interacted much. For the coming year, we certainly want to improve on that. 

We also plan to overhaul the project pages to make them more conducive to collaboration, and we are pondering the idea of expanding the concept of a WikiProject Open Access to projects other than the English Wikipedia, e.g. to other languages or to Wikimedia Commons. You are warmly invited to add your voice to all that. We would also appreciate if you would share some of your OA-related activities by way of our [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Open Access/News/Content|news ticker]] or via the monthly [[:outreach:Category:This Month in GLAM Open Access reports|Open Access report]] that is part of the [[:outreach:GLAM/Newsletter|GLAM newsletter]] (to which you can subscribe [[:m:Global message delivery/Targets/GLAM|here]]), or as you see fit otherwise. 

As a visual token of the anniversary, I am adding today's [[:commons:Open Access File of the Day|Open Access File of the Day]]. Feel free to [[:commons:Open Access File of the Day/Nominations|nominate files]] yourself. As of today, [[:commons:Category:Open access (publishing)]] contains more than 15,000 files, of which about 2/3 are video and sound files uploaded by the [[:commons:User:Open Access Media Importer Bot|Open Access Media Importer]].

Thanks for being part of the project, and looking forward to more interaction. With a smile, --&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;&quot;&gt; [[User:Daniel Mietchen|Daniel Mietchen]] - [[:m:WiR/OS|WiR/OS]] ([[User talk:Daniel Mietchen|talk]]) &lt;/font&gt; 23:54, 10 January 2013 (UTC)

== Wikipedia Ambassadors update ==

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can [[Wikipedia:Education_Working_Group/Proposal|read more about the proposal here]].

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See [[Wikipedia:Course pages]] and [[Help:Education Program extension]] for more details.) Included in the extension are ''online volunteer'' and ''campus volunteer'' user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

'''''If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile.''''' If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

;Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can [[Special:UserRights|grant the rights yourself]], for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just [[Wikipedia talk:Ambassadors/Become an ambassador|post your rights request here]], and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
*[[Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile]]
*[[Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile]]

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at [[Special:CampusAmbassadors]] and [[Special:OnlineAmbassadors]] will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at [[Special:Courses]]. (By default, this lists &quot;Current&quot; courses, but you can change the Status filter to &quot;Planned&quot; to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to [[User_talk:Sage_Ross_(WMF)|me (Sage Ross)]] with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at [[Wikipedia:Course pages]], and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them [[Wikipedia:Training/For educators/Setting up your course|here]].

;Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
# [[WP:ENB|The education noticeboard]] has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
# [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/ambassador-announce-l The Ambassadors Announce email list] is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
# If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the {{freenode|wikipedia-en-ambassadors}} IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

;Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online [[Wikipedia:Training/For Ambassadors|training for Ambassadors]], which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings [[Wikipedia:Training/For students|for students]] and [[Wikipedia:Training/For educators|for educators]] as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where the Ambassadors fit in, or if you want to review and help improve it. If there's something you'd like to see added, or other suggestions you have for it, feel free to edit the training and/or leave feedback. A [[Wikipedia:Training/For educators/Setting up your course|primer on setting up and using course pages]] is included in the educators' training.

The [[Wikipedia:Training/For Ambassadors/Resources|Resources page]] of the training is the main place for Ambassador-related resources. If there's something you think is important as a resource that's not on there, please add it.

Finally, whether or not you work with any classes this term, I encourage you to post entries to the [[Wikipedia:Ambassadors/Courses/Trophy case|Trophy Case]] whenever you see excellent work from students or if you have great examples from past semesters. And, as always, let students (and other editors!) know when they do things well; a little WikiLove goes a long way!

==Women's history editathon==
Hey -
Sorry for the late notice, but since you have yourself tagged as living in the Bay Area, I thought you might appreciate notification that we’re having an event Saturday!  It’ll be held at Hoyt Hall, an all-women's house of the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]] from 3 to 6 pm tomorrow.  The main event page is [[Wikipedia:Meetup/Hoyt_Hall_Women%27s_edit-a-thon|here]].
Anyone is welcome to show up, but we’re expecting a significant number of people to come who have literally never edited Wikipedia before.  If you’re an experienced Wikipedian who would be able to provide useful help to some of the newbies, your presence would be especially appreciated (and it might be a good idea for you to show up at 2 or 2:30 instead of three.
Thanks,  [[User:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman]] ([[User talk:Kevin Gorman|talk]]) 01:58, 6 April 2013 (UTC)
&lt;small&gt;I’m AWB’ing this message to all Wikipedians who have tagged themselves in the bay area.  I’m sorry if the message isn’t of interest to you; feel free to delete it.   I’ll be unlikely to send future messages in a similar way, but if really don’t want to receive future messages of this sort, please let me know. &lt;/small&gt;

==Disambiguation link notification for September 22==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956]], you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages [[Secretary of the Interior]] and [[American Indians]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Indian_Relocation_Act_of_1956|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Indian_Relocation_Act_of_1956|fix with Dab solver]]).

The Edit-a-thon will occur in parallel with [[Litquake]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s annual literature festival. Writers from all over the Bay Area and the world will be in town during the nine day festival, so the timing is just right for us to meetup and create/translate/expand/improve articles about literature and writers. All levels of Wikipedia editing experience are welcome. This event will include new editor training. RSVP [[Wikipedia:Meetup/San Francisco/Litquake Edit-a-Thon|'''→here←''']]. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 02:55, 27 September 2014 (UTC)

== Technical question ==

Do you have any idea how we can have a preload page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CorporateM/request_edit/correction/preload like this] that will preload a Request Edit template, but without adding the preload page itself to the Request Edit category?

Dear fellow Wikipedian,

In celebration of [[Wikipedia:WikiWomen's History Month|WikiWomen's History Month]], the SF Bay Area Wikipedia community has two events in early March -- please consider attending!

First, we have an '''[[Wikipedia:Meetup/San Francisco/ArtandFeminism 2015|ArtAndFeminism edit-a-thon]]''', which will take place at the [[Kadist Art Foundation]] from 12 noon to 6pm on Saturday, March 7.  We'll be one of many sites worldwide participating in this edit-a-thon on March 7th.  So join us as we help improve Wikipedia's coverage of women artists and their works!

Second, we will be celebrating [[International Women's Day]] with the '''[[Wikipedia:Meetup/San Francisco/International Women's Day 2015|International Women's Day edit-a-thon]]''' on Sunday, March 8 from 1pm to 5pm at the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Our editing focus will be on women, of course!
 
I hope to see you there! [[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) - via [[User:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[User talk:MediaWiki message delivery|talk]]) 18:06, 20 February 2015 (UTC)
