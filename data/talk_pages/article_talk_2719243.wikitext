==Evidence presented by {Johnski}==

This is my response to Davidpdx's allegations. 

==Not a part of an organizational push==

I am not a part of an organizational push, only tried to take an interesting article and make it more interesting by showing more than one side to the story, and adding important U.S. governmental quotes and links, removing bias, toning down strong language, removing errors, etc.  I was delighted to learn how Wikipedia works which lead to other articles that had some connection, but wasn’t trying to spam or advertise anything by exploring wiki-linking from and to other articles, categories. Made many good arguments for these changes, corrections, additions, all of which were ignored by Davidpdx and some of his allies, such as can be see at:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dominion_of_Melchizedek/Archive01], and 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dominion_of_Melchizedek/Archive02], and
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dominion_of_Melchizedek].

==3RR==

There may have been a few 3RR violations in the early stages out of not understanding the rules, but mostly tried to edit to improve the article instead of merely reverting and fought again plain bias.

==Lack of Wikiquette by Davidpdx==

Davidpdx has become more polite recently, but has been cruel in what he has written in the past and showed his inability to work with me, as per: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dominion_of_Melchizedek/Archive02] he wrote:

“Second, I have stated I am not willing to work with you, therefore why would I respond to your email? This was a conversation we had a month ago in which you never responded. You would not respond to my prompts for proof as to certain claims you were making. In addition, your good buddy Samspade was insulting. Why would I work with either of you now? 
Third, you are now claiming seven people support the version that you are pushing? I really think you should stop taking acid, it's really making you have delusions. In fact, there are TWO people (you and Samspade) that are pushing for the revisions. There are at lease three people that oppose any changes. Either way there is no consensus. If you would actually bother to read the rules, you would see that this means that the previous version must remain unless a consensus can be reached.” .... Davidpdx 12:17, 15 October 2005 (UTC) 
Falsely claiming that  KAJ was my sock-puppet Davidpdx wrote that I’m a complete idiot:

“How about IP addresses and the fact I'm in South Korea? I have students that use logic better then you do and they speak English as a second language. What a complete idiot you are! Davidpdx 12:18, 21 October 2005 (UTC) “

==Davidpdx taking control over DOM and other articles==

Davidpdx has taken control over the DOM article and the Taongi article before it was protected, but has never contributed one edit to either other than adding &quot;fraud&quot; as a category. Jdavidb has backed Davidpdx up, without making any edits.

==No substance to Davidpdx’s claims==

His allegations herein have not shown any substance, only links expecting the arbitrators to figure out why mine and others articles were not better than the ones he and a few others insist on reverting to.

Even my last DOM edit which only corrected a mis-characterization of an article from the Washington Post where I changed &quot;probably&quot; to what the article really stated, &quot;you get the feeling&quot;, they will not let stand.  Davidpdx showed some interest in this change, but cowered to Gene_Poole when he insisted to let it stand as &quot;probably&quot; which is what Poole claimed was what the article really meant even though it said, &quot;you get the feeling&quot;. Now Jdavidb in his evidence can’t see why the quote shouldn’t be accurate.  As if Wikipedia standards shouldn’t insist on accuracy when quoting from a source such as the Washington Post.

==Wikilante==

I hope that the wisdom in my article I created about Wikilante will someday be accepted, as it wasn't intended as harassment, only a cry for help with Davidpdx's vigilante behavior. I hoped it could be a useful wikiword to be used when vigilante behavior was found elsewhere by others.  I also hoped it would help Davidpdx to see what he was doing. Contrary to what Jdavidb claims in his evidence, I didn’t understand what happened to the article, so tried a second time to post an improved version, but quit when I realized two admins had deleted it.

==Gene_Poole main culprit==

Although Davidpdx's behavior has impeded the progress of the DOM article, the main culprit, is Gene_ Poole. Although Poole has made some useful contributions to the related article, Poole seems to have no regard for the truth, is flippant, full of insults, and writes whatever suits his fancy. (See evidence submitted by KAJ).  Poole acts like a bully with Davidpdx acting like his enforcer. 

==Below Davidpdx inserts his comments to my evidence==

:First, please tell me how links I provided are &quot;mis-characterized?&quot; How can I be providing &quot;false dates&quot; when the Wikipedia server records the time and date stamp in terms of when the edit occurs, not me? The links were pulled directly off the history page of [[Dominion of Melchizedek]] article. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;action=history]

::you wrote 5 to 7 Sept but looking at the first link [5] it is Sept 4th. As pointed out that could be an error on your part and I am not saying you did it on purpose.

:Second, you have had a pattern of blaming one person in particular for what you deem &quot;vigilante behavior.&quot; I will gladly provide the diffs to show where you claim for quite sometime that I was the only one giving you a hard time. Now, your claiming Gene Poole is the main culprit {ringleader, etc). So which is it? Make up your mind? The truth is, there are '''nine''' people who have constantly oppose the content of your edits, with good reason. We have stated those reasons as the same reason why we filed a request for arbitration. Stop claiming that only one person opposes your edits. There are many people that are on record who have reverted your edits over and over again.

::Your behavior is vigilante, where I believe others may not go that far. Yes there are others that share your twisted view of me and my work, but Gene Poole, a bully, has more teeth in his bite, and he may have a few sock-puppets to boot. If you are innocent, why have you and Centauri (Gene's sock-puppet?) refused to disclose your IP addresses?

:Third, as I have learned from looking up IP addresses, there are only three people that support the edits you are trying to make, not the 7 to 10 people you claim. I have obtained information from IP addresses which show where those individuals live. It is a lesser charge then the sockpuppet accusation, but nonetheless proves collaboration on your part to collude with others to make changes (including removing information) to cover up the fraud on the part of DOM. I have not yet provided the diffs to talk about the problems with the content, we will be doing that as more evidence is posted. The diffs I have posted show exactly when you and your co-conspirators {KAJ and SamuelSpade) edited based on the time stamp on the Wikipedia server.[[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 11:36, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

::That is only your opinion, not facts. I only have 1 IP address. I have no interest in removing any thing in the article that doesn't belong there, which means two sides of the story, not just the one you want to see. There is loads of stuff in my versions that include the negative parts. Let me see you disprove that.  My only efforts have been to bring balance and improve an interesting article to make it more interesting and diverse for the viewing audience. You can see others besides myself and those you claim in concert with me, have recently expressed a desire to see more content. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 05:13, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:::First of all, I've asked you nicely '''not to put comments inbetween mine'''. I'll ask you nicely one more time to change that. I believe it's impolite to do so and I believe I told you that before on the DOM page.

:::Second, you have removed several creditable sources that are negative in terms of DOM and not ever given any reason why you have removed them other then your usual rhetoric about what you called &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; I'm sorry your idea of fair and balanced is about that of Fox News. I will be glad to provide you proof you have removed sources that have been a part of the article for sometime and not showed any ryme or reason for it. Would you like to show me exactly where you stated why you have removed sources? I'd be interested to see such a post on your part.

:::Furthermore, I'd also be more then happy to provide proof of your constant reverts against the consensus of others. As well as showing IP providers in terms of user names associated with pro-Dom reverts. Notice in my rebuttal I never said you had more then one IP address (which you incorrectly stated above), but that you and two other people are working in conjunction to whitewash the DOM page. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 06:56, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Dear Davidpdx, you are the one that is not polite writing in the section that is exclusively for me to write (evidence) in, and you noticed I didn't write in your (evidence) section.  I'm sorry that you feel it is impolite the way I try to communicate with you.  I have not always repeated my reasons each time I revert or edit, but briefly, I've removed stuff that is either a repeated link, or dublicated information, the same as in the other link, for example the scamdog link doesn't add anything new or different or is from a source that isn't credible.  What credentials does the scamdog web site have to make it worthy of Wikipedia, or what does it add that is new or different to make the article more informative?  However, it is you that should be proving stuff as you are the one that brought the arb case out of fear that I would do it first after I told you that would be my only solution if you didn't accept [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Davidpdx/Archive01#Mediation] mediation. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 07:38, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:::::I am permitted (as I understand) to rebut what you say. In addition, I did ask you polite (but firm] manner to remove the comments. I could have said several other things. I will ask you again to remove the comments, otherwise I'll ask the arbitration committee to do it for you.

:::::Second, In your initial rebuttal, you made several counter-claims that were false, which I will continue to set straight. This included a statement by you insinuating that the evidence I provide was &quot;'''mis-characterized by false dating'''&quot; as well as stating that I am the person causing all the problems. Yet it is you, SamuelSpade and KAJ that have exhibited behavior showing you think'''your above the rules of Wikipedia'''.

:::::Third, I have only started to post evidence. It is by far not all of the evidence, but about 1/3rd of what I will post. '''Mediation was not an option''', therefore the next step was arbitration. '''I did file a case for mediation''' (I'd be happy to provide you with the link if you don't believe me) and was told it wasn't a good fit. If you look back at the arbitration filling, one of the mediators stated that I had indeed contacted them about this. It's just as simple as that. I also waited several days to see if things would calm down. The fact is, you, KAJ and SamuelSpade relented on reverting several pages, so much so, that they had to be protected. You can try to twist it anyway you want, but that's the truth. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 09:18, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:::::: Dear Davidpdx, you are not permitted to rebut what I say here in my area, which shows you do not read the rules. I am also not permitted to remove or move the comments already placed here. You don't have to ask the arbitration committee to do it for you because they will when they finally see it. 

::::::Second, My behavior hasn't shown anymore than yours that I think I'm above the rules of Wikipedia.

::::::Third, Mediation would have been an option, if you pointed out that I requested it of you and therefore we both asked for it. It was Wikifacts and Gene Poole's little edit war that led to the protection of the DOM article.  You can try to twist it anyway you want, but that's the truth. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 06:05, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

*===Removal of Negative Information ===

Davidpdx wrote in the evidence section below: &quot;Here are diffs showing first the version that has consensus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;oldid=25787356]and then his whitewashed version [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;oldid=25874544]. But (Scamdog) is not the only site Johnski has removed, another one is called Quatloos! [http://www.quatloos.com/groups/melchiz.htm] which is a non-profit financial &amp; tax fraud education website. When he removes these links, he also removes the quotes that were in the article. This is again, essentially whitewashing the article of negative links and quotes in favor of the very waterdown misquotes he would rather use.&quot; 

*This again shows that Davidpdx doesn't read the articles, or look at the links, as the link to quatloos is there right after the most damning statement about DOM and purportedly made by John Shockey, former employee of the US OCC. Davidpdx can not show one misquote from me. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 20:13, 30 November 2005 (UTC)


===US OCC issue===

Davidpdx complains to this arbitration panel that “Johnski also references an alert by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the US government, right after the Quatloos quote. He has framed the quote as follows: ‘However, the only official reference to Melchizedek by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency refers to Melchizedek as a ‘non-recognized sovereignty’ that ‘licensed’ Caribbean Bank of Commerce.’”

What Davidpx fails to point out is that after Jdavidb showed that “however” wasn’t a good follow up to the statement from Shockey, I never used “however” again in this context.  In my last attempt to substantially improve the article on November 13, 2005, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;oldid=28184470]
I wrote, “The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency website is less vocal and only refers to Melchizedek as a 'non-recognized sovereignty' that 'licensed' Caribbean Bank of Commerce.&quot; In the external links this is called a “warning” from the US OCC as seen further below.

Doesn’t it seem fitting that if you are going to quote a former employee of the US OCC that you also quote from that employee’s boss from their official web site on the subject?

Davidpdx goes on to mis-characterize, “He (Johnski) tries to make this quote look like a form of diplomatic recognition by the US Government. While the document itself is referenced after the quote, his version fails to mention that the source is in fact a alert sent to banks regarding fradulent banks licensed by DOM. The full source document states: 'Information has been received that the subject entity holding a bank license issued by the Dominion of Melchizedek, a non-recognized sovereignty, has an unauthorized address in the United States.  This entity, subject to Alert 98-14, dated April 21, 1998, subsequently had its Antigua license reinstated. However, the government of Antigua and Barbuda, through its supervisor of banks, has recently given notice that the subject entity's license will again be revoked.’&quot; [http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/Alert/98-38.txt]

While it may or may not be true that the alert is regarding “fraudulent” banks, the alert doesn’t call the banks “fraudulent” as Davidpdx falsely claims.  While Davidpdx claims to have worked with me, he could have easily come up with a compromise language to address his concern, but only reverts the article to versions that he never authors. In fact in previous editions I had mentioned the context of the quotes.

Davidpdx continues, “After looking at the full quote, one can see this has nothing to do with recognition as Johnski is trying to make the quote appear. The US government does not recognize DOM, however over and over again in both his reverts and on the talk pages, Johnski tries to push the idea that this is a form of recognition. If anything, the reference proves DOM's questionable nature because of its relationship with banks that commit fradulent activites.”

This begs the question, if the US OCC website &quot;proves&quot; what Davidpdx claims, then why doesn’t he want to see the referenced quotes in the article?

I am not inserting anything of my opinion about recognition in the article, only quoting what the US OCC web site states.  My opinions on the talk page are only opinions, but I have never indicated that the reference to DOM on the US OCC web site is any form of dejure or “diplomatic” recognition of DOM as Davidpdx falsely claims.

Also, the November 15 article referenced above does have a link in the external links to the Quatloos article here:
*Dominion of Melchizedek as a Scam - Collection of all negative articles and opinions about Melchizedek and its founders, quoting only the negative aspects, and the criminal activities of the banks it licensed. 
* Warning from the Comptroller of the US Treasury Department. 

Certainly my last version needs more work, but instead of merely reverting, Davidpdx and others should try to keep the stuff that belongs there, such as quotes from US government web sites, more details of DOM’s origin, etc. There are a growing number that see the need for this as evidenced on the DOM talk page.

==Selective Use of Sources==

Davidpdx falsely claims that by bringing two quotes of the SEC case to the DOM article I am using selective sources.  The opposite is the truth. Adding more evidence from the same source is being more inclusive. Davidpdx writes, under the heading Selective Use of Sources, &quot;Under the heading of ''10 November 2005 rewrite'', Johnski again references a document which calls into question DOM's role in banks who are committing fradulent acts. However, the primary purpose of using this piece of information has nothing to do with the true content of the document, which is SEC Commission Release announcing a settlement in the case against World Financial &amp; Investment Co., Inc. and Victor M. Wilson. The part of this release Johnski pushes is references is the fact that the SEC used, 'The Dominion of Melchizidek has a website promoting itself as a sovereign entity, recognized by certain governments.' Again, trying to imply that the US is giving recognition to DOM as well as leaving out the fact that the documents he is referencing have to do with fraudlent banks licensed by the organization he's trying to push.&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dominion_of_Melchizedek#10_November_2005_rewrite]. 

My last attempt on November 13 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;oldid=28184470], to balance the two statements from the US SEC was as follows: &quot;When brining a lawsuit against a New York lawyer, the Dominion of Melchizedek was described as 'non-existent' by the United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. [http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16368.htm].  When the SEC concluded that case, it wrote that the 'Dominion of Melchizidek has a website promoting itself as a sovereign entity, recognized by certain governments.'&quot;[http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17054.htm]

The &quot;non-existent&quot; statement by the US SEC was never removed by me, only balanced by the fact that the SEC ended with a different statement than it started with. In this case, it is Davidpdx that wants an unbalanced, selective account of the facts. Again, if Davidpdx was really interested in reaching consensus, he could have easily added something to point out that the New York lawyer was purportedly using a DOM bank but the reader has two links to learn the whole story. My intention isn't to push anything here, just give a more complete picture.  I didn't write what the SEC wrote, am not claiming that it is any form of recognition, only think that it needs to be quoted to make the article fair and balanced. [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 19:16, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

==TAONGI==

After drini said that he liked a toned down version of the Taongi article with mention of DOM, Dadivpdx concurred, but later denied his concurrence: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bokak_Atoll&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24302902]
Gotta say I like the new version much better as it's been toned down. -- (☺drini♫|☎) 06:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
You would hope so. At least for now it has. Davidpdx 9/29/05 7:48 (UTC) 

===Reverting without Consensus, Inability to show good faith and discuss before reverting===

Davidpdx claims that I didn’t discuss before reverting which is the opposite of the truth, when in fact he is the one that reverts without discussing.  I was patient with him for 11 days waiting to see the slightest progress but he was incapable of showing any good faith.  Davidpdx never made one suggestion to change anything in the DOM or Taongi articles.  If he couldn’t show any progress after 9 days, when would he show it?

Davidpdx claims I didn’t cite any credible sources, yet between myself and others, the Washington Post, Forbes Magazine, Context Magazine, CBS and SBS TV programs, SEC and OCC web sites were cited.  Davidpdx also didn’t think that the web site of DOM was a source that could be cited or used.  This shows that he clearly doesn’t understand Wikipedia policies.

==Boldly Edit==

Wikipedia policy to boldly edit out bias was brought to Davidpdx’s attention, but it fell on death ears.

Davidpdx stated that he would rather see a reversion war than find a compromise.

===Davidpdx’s use of Johnski Email/IP===

It appears that Davidpdx’s only reason for inviting me to communicate via email was to gain knowledge of my email IP address as Davidpdx never responded to my email, but falsely leads you to believe he did by referring to an “exchange of emails” which never occurred.

===Davidpdx’s inability to reason logically regarding myself and the DOM article===

The most recent and blatant example is that Davidpdx claims that a blog called “Rotuma Scam” belongs to me.  However, there is no connection between myself and that Blog, and none can be evidenced by Davidpdx. [http://headheeb.blogmosis.com/archives/015237.html]. You can see that the author of that Blog has made the argument below in two sections that there is no connection between the name “Johnski” and Jonathan Edelstein.  It also shows that Davidpdx doesn’t read what I write, because he claims I’m Jewish as is Jonathan Edelstein, but as I have pointed out to both Davidpdx and Jdavidb that I am a Christian Scientist.  So Davidpdx is off on every point, including the most important one, that being, that, he claims that I am pro-DOM, but the blog that he doesn’t wanted linked from the [[Rotuma]] article is clearly NOT pro-DOM.

===Rebuttal to Jdavidb===

** [[WP:NPOV]] states &quot;Articles should be written without bias, representing all majority and significant minority views fairly.&quot;  It appears that the majority view about the Dominion of Melchizedek is that it exists primarily for the purpose of fraud.  Johnski's attempts to &quot;tone this down&quot; have resulted in the deliberate misuse and obfuscation of quotes to misrepresent opinions as being more favorable to DOM.

This is patently untrue, as the article still gives a very negative view of DOM in light of the quotes from Shockey saying that the whole thing is a major fraud,  and the other fraud related and negative aspects to the article that I have not removed.

=== Revert warring on [[Dominion of Melchizedek]] ===

Since September 23, 2005 Jdavidb, Davidpdx, Gene_Poole and his suspected sock puppet, Centauri, have reverted the DOM article 70 time, few of which included edits.

Davidpdx falsely claims that I reverted the DOM article 60 times, but since I began September 4th I have only reverted the article less than half that many times most of which have included edits or relevant comments.

==== POV pushing ====
Johnski removes wording that properly contextualizes a POV in this attempt to obfuscate wording to imply legitimacy for the alleged recognition by CAR:
* 2005-09-29 06:27:17 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;diff=24299372&amp;oldid=24287673]

*So, trying to make the quote accurate implies legitimacy?

==== Version 2 ====
Jdavidb wrote in his evidence: Now DOM is an &quot;entity.&quot;  Also, rather than operating fraudulent banks, DOM just happens to &quot;have a history of licensing banks that turned out to be fraudulent.&quot;  He's given up claiming that it was a discovery; now he's working on implicitly asserting that there was an ancient history phase and a modern history phase.  As well he wants to assert that the modern history phase goes back to the 1950's rather than the creation date of 1986.

*Context magazine is the source for the 1950’s not me, so doesn’t it improve the article to add more history?  A micronation is an “entity” isn’t it?  There is no evidence that DOM operated the banks, so shouldn’t that fact be clarified?

Jdavidb wrote: Note attempt to use the damning quote, &quot;The Dominion of Melchizidek has a website promoting itself as a sovereign entity, recognized by certain governments,&quot; to imply that DOM is a sovereign entity, when the intent of the quote is nothing of the sort.  Standard modus operandi for Johnski.  Note also removal of quoted material from Quatloos: &quot;Claims that the DoM has received recognition from any major government are purely lies&quot; as well as links to that site.

*Here Jdavidb claims that quoting from the SEC web site is a “damning quote”.  So only use quotes that lend Jdavidb’s POV to the article?  I’ve never claimed that this is recognition of DOM. The following is only one of the quotes from the Quatloos web site used in the article and clearly doesn’t belong there.  No where in the article does it state that DoM is claiming to have “received recognition from any major government”, so why should it be quoted?

:Dude, you're like, way confused.  A &quot;damning quote&quot; means it is damning or detrimental to ''your'' POV.  What I'm pointing out is not that there's a problem with the quote but that you're trying to use a quote that does NOT say anything supporting your case and frame it in such a way that it appears to support your case.  But expect that in response to this you'll just pretend to have missed the point I am making. [[User:Jdavidb|Jdavidb]] ([[User_talk:Jdavidb|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Jdavidb|contribs]]) 19:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

::Dear Jdavidb, Thank you for clarifying your point, however it changes nothing, since my attempt was clearly to bring balance to the article (and only from) what the SEC wrote, and nothing more. The point is that the SEC certainly drew a different conclusion when they settled their case, otherwise they would have stuck to only referring to DOM as &quot;non-existent&quot;.  You only wanting to quote that part of what they said, would be no different than if I only wanted to quote the concluding statement. Ignoring either is wrong. If it is true that you don't see a problem with the quote, why do you keep removing it, or why don't you change the context to what you think is appropriate? If the SEC first wrote that DOM had &quot;a website promoting itself as a sovereign entity&quot; then when settling the case, stated it was &quot;non-existent&quot;, then there would be nothing to balance. How can something that is non-existent have &quot;a website promoting itself as a sovereign entity&quot;, so obviously the US SEC realized that DOM does in fact exist, and attempted to give an explanation of what it purports to exist as. Again, I have never claimed that this is any sort of recognition by the US SEC. Certainly you can accept this reality? 

::Regarding your claim that linking the Melchizedek Bible is spamming, that is not true, since it is an online version of the Bible, and there is a section for such on the subject of Bible.  However, after seeing [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABible&amp;diff=23859824&amp;oldid=23643460] I realized that it didn't belong there, and quit.  When you realize you are wrong, you persist, i.e. the WP issue, etc.  Also, I see you can't answer my questions on your user page of long ago. Certainly your hatred for Christian Science affects your judgment here? Cordially, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 20:38, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

==== POV BIRDS OF A FEATHER ====

Quoting from Jdavidb’s evidence:
 2005-10-15 21:01:44 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;diff=25609175&amp;oldid=25499770] (Now he tries to imply that since the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency refers to Melchizedek as a &quot;non-recognized sovereignty&quot; that it is a sovereignty as opposed to unrecognized.  While each prior revert in this section has added additional material, later reverts to version 2 are basically the same as this one.)

*On this subject, Davidpdx and Jdavidb seem to have the same logical reasoning problems, as Jdavidb is claiming that my quoting the US OCC as having referred to DOM as a “non-recognized sovereignty” that DOM is a “sovereignty” as opposed to “unrecognized”.  I’ve never made any such argument, only argued that a sovereignty is a sovereignty whether recognized or not, but my opinion isn’t in the article, and have only asked that the US OCC web site be quoted as saying exactly what it states, that the US OCC refers to  DOM as “an unrecognized sovereignty”.

==== Version 3 ====
Quoting from Jdavidb’s evidence:
“Finally conceded DOM is a micronation
 2005-10-19 00:21:34 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dominion_of_Melchizedek&amp;diff=25874544&amp;oldid=25787356]

*This does not concede that DOM is a micronation, only gave into it for the sake of trying to get along, something that the Davids and Poole can’t show they have tried to do.

==== Version 4 ====
Quoting from Jdavidb’s evidence:
“Now Melchizedek's (unofficially claimed) area is the &quot;entire earth,&quot; and it was founded in 1991 when its constitution was signed, though still &quot;conceived&quot; in the 1950s.”

*This is all documented on the talk page with quotes from CBS and citing Context Magazine.

==== Last stab ====

*Even my last stab to get the WP article accurately quoted, Jdavidb thinks is my attempt to make the DOM seem more favorable.  Why does that have to be the case?  And who cares if accurately quoting the WP does or doesn’t make the DOM look more favorable?  So let’s make the quote less accurate to make the DOM look less favorable, must be the argument, but is that Wikipedian policy?

=== Spamming on [[Ecclesiastical state]], etc. ===

The fact is that Ecclesiastical government has been adopted as a Wikipedian article, so something good has come out of this debate, and a new article.

I didn’t start DOM as an acronym, as it has been used in credible sources outside of Wikipedia to refer to Dominion of Melchizedek. 

I either answered Jdavidb’s other issues already or in some cases don’t feel that it is necessary to respond, as all of my efforts have been in good faith, and I have shown an ability to grow with my contributions at Wikipedia.

Johnski, glad you signed up for a handle. Sorry I haven't been around. A combination of being sick as well as being pretty pissed at one of the admins for an off the cuff (and PMS type) remark. Anyway, I'm kind of pissed right now about Wikipedia. I might end up disappearing for awhile. 

I really want to start a blog and write about what's going on in the US. I've been pretty tired lately with work and all and can't really seem to muster the energy to do much. Hopefully in a few days things will change. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 9/22/05 1:52 (UTC)

:Hi Davidpdx, Nice to see your human touch, and learn more about what is going on with you. Sorry to learn that you've been sick.  Hope you have a quick and full recovery, and that you don't leave wikipedia, as I'm sure you must have a lot to offer. Sorry I reverted something without seeing this first.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 06:44, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

::John I was sick, but also kind of mad. There was a heated argument over the [[Ray Nagin]] page and still is the last time I checked. It is amazing the politcal garbage people will put into articles. Unfortuately, I got in kind of a yelling match and lost it. That's why I disappeared for a few days. 

::Anyway here is an old email address if you want to send me anything. I'd prefer links and things copy/pasted versus attachments. I'm alwasy so worried I'll get a virus or something. I don't know if your like me, but I'd die without my computer! LOL Anyway, let me know. Also feel free to leave a message on [[User_talk:Davidpdx|My Talk Page]]. Just to let you know there is a rather large time diffrence between where you are and where I am (maybe 9-16 hours depending on where you are). Also I will be out this weekend, I'll tell you about it next week. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 9/28/05 11:29

::John I have posted questions on the DOM talk page. As I stated, the page should not be reverted until a consensus is reached.

= Removal of NPOV tag on Bokak Atoll =

Please DO NOT remove NPOV tag on [[Bokak Atoll]]. The material in this article IS being disputed. If you remove the tag again, I will report it as vandalism. Davidpdx 10/3/05 8:53 (UTC)
If this is addressed to me, I don't remember removing it[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 06:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

= Reverting DOM article =

Please stop reverting this article until there is a consensus or compromise langauge that has been agreed to. The version posted by 03:54, 3 October 2005 El C is the version that should remain until further notice. Doing otherwise in insistance of compromise that does not exsist severely damages your creditablity. It also could hamper any possiblity of others to work with you to come to a meaningful agreement. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 10/3/05 9:04 (UTC)

== DOM ==

:''I'm curious if your concern for this subject is motivated by your religious faith and if you see Melchizedek's claim to ecclesiastical statehood as a threat to that faith.''

No.  I believe in open study of all religions.  I have studied religions with which I emphatically disagree, including Catholicism, Orthodox Judaism, B'nai Noach, and Islam, sometimes to such depths that I think my wife feared I was planning to convert.  I do not believe in the principle of withholding information about a religion on the idea that it may be a threat to true faith.  And I certainly fear nothing from the DOM &quot;religion.&quot;  I see no grain of truth there nor do I even see anything of interest.

Thankfully on Wikipedia we have constructed policies which can be followed by any editor regardless of his personal convictions or motivations which will result in unbiased articles.  Editors on any side of an issue or even editors who do not care about an issue can still make the right decisions for an article.

:I'm glad to see that you want unbiased articles.  Do you really believe that the DOM article is unbiased?  I certainly can't see how it is either fair, balanced, or completely factual.

:''Do you see any genuine faith in their translation of the Bible or their effort to &quot;resurrect&quot; the &quot;Dominion of Melchizedek&quot; from antiquity?''

No.  Regardless of the fraud claims, the religious claims are utterly without merit and would probably be theologically irrelevant even if they had any merit.

:I suspected you would have this opinion, but how much of their faith have you studied?

Your use of the pronoun &quot;their&quot; is disingenuous, but not unexpected. [[User:Jdavidb|Jdavidb]] 13:41, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:What is disingenuous about my use of the word &quot;their&quot;.  Are you suggesting that I am one of them? Personally, I am a Christian Scientist, not a Melchizedekian.  There is a connection in as much as DOM's translation of the Bible is based on the writings of Mary Baker Eddy.  She is the founder of Christian Science.  Do you also find Christian Science to be utterly without merit and/or theologically irrelevant?[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 16:59, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

::::(Reply to message on my talk page) John, It goes far beyond seeing the points that you are making. I'm willing to, but again as I've said countless times the rules regarding sighting creditable sources need to be followed. Should someone break the rules simply to have a fair and balanced article as you are stating. No, they shouldn't. And even if I did, someone else would come along and point out the lack of creditable proof and pull the claim out of the article (rightfully so).

::::I've left you some link to the guidelines Wikipedia uses. I also asked for the links that SamSpade was talking about (SBS, ect) on the DOM page. If you could leave a message with those on my talk page, I'll look at them. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 10/8/05 1:34 (UTC)

:David, thank you for these helpful references. Even though you have personally attacked me, I will try to be friendly towards you. I apologize for anything that I've written that may have offened you.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 17:22, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

= Response to message left on my talk page =

:::The truth is there is NO consensus. Because the two of you claim this trash is true, doesn't not make it so. It is absolutely ridiclous to claim consensus. I have posted on BOTH your your talk pages about consensus on Wikipedia and neither one of you seem to care about it. I will continue to revert the page back to the one that was last agreed upon and report all reverts by both you as vandalism. If you want a revert war, simply bring it on. It is not only myself that disagrees with what you are posting, there are others who have made comments on the DOM page regarding the lack of proof you base your article on. I will be posting this on both of your talk pages in order to make sure you see this message. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 11:03, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

::::Johnski, consensus means we talk it over on the article talk page and all agree.  Until you get that, we don't have consensus.  So, prove your case on the article talk page and secure agreement.  Otherwise, you are not entitled to make your changes.  Continuing to make these changes is disruption of Wikipedia.  Eventually it will result in escalation of reports against you and could cause you to have your editing privileges restricted or revoked.

::::In short: stop it.  Don't make another change to articles until you get it agreed to on article talk pages. [[User:Jdavidb|Jdavidb]] [[User_talk:Jdavidb|(talk)]] 16:52, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::Jdavidb, this is not in response to the question I asked of you.  Please answer it about Christian Science.  You have totally missed the point of what I am trying to do with the Melchizedek article, as I've backed off the original position and only tried to make a compromise using stuff that there is consensus on, just rewriting it to tone it down.  I didn't revert it just to revert it but because there was vandalism on the version version that you seem to approve.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 06:14, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::There was vandalism by someone else, which was reverted, that is true. But I do not agree upon the alternate version that you had posted on the talk page. If you simply reverted back to the version that was there then that is fine. I looked at the current article and to me it looked like the article you posted was the &quot;alternate version&quot; that was posted by you. If it was that version that you posted, I would remind you that there was no consensus. Hopefully that clears up the issue. 

::::::Please be aware that that I am not the only one watching this page. There are two or three other people that are monitoring articles in terms of what is posted. Certainly these people agree with me that the things you are posting do not have enough proof behind them to merit changing the articles. You can disagree with any of us as much as you want, but I doubt it will change any of our opinions. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 06:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your email ==

Hi David,

You promised to post your email address but I don't remember seeing it.  I think I could clear up some of the points a lot easier and faster if we could use email.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 07:04, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, I did post me email address. If you go back and look at an old version of your talk page you'll find it. I only left it there for a few days because of the possiblity of spammers getting it. However, I would suggest reading the DOM talk page before you do that. It probably will clear up where I stand at this point. 

:To put it bluntly, I've asked for web links or other methods of proof in terms of specific points you claim in the compromise article discussion. Both you and Samspade claim you've showed me that proof. When I've asked for those, they could just as well be put on my user talk page. In one instance, Samspade even went as far as insulting me on the DOM talk page. Both of you have reverted articles and lack a good faith effort in the discussion. Therefore, I have archived the discussion and posted my reasoning for withdrawing from discussions on a compromise article. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 07:34, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::As I stated on the DOM page, I'm unwilling to work on a compromise. I don't have anything else to say. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 10:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

= Articles for Deletion David Even Pedley =

Comment: Merging requires the edit history of the source of the merged info to be kept. Therefore, merge and delete is not a valid vote. See Wikipedia:Guide to deletion. - 131.211.51.34 09:49, 18 October 2005 (UTC) 

Wow another bs move by Johnski and unsigned at that. This is from the person who tried to convience me that blogs could be used as a creditable source. Speaking of creditablity, you are shooting yourself in the foot in terms of your creditablity by the statements you make. You purposly lie and misrepresent the rules of Wikipedia to push DOM. In fact, here is the true interpretation of the rule you misquoted: 
&quot;An AFD decision is either to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; the article. 

AFD discussions which fail to reach rough consensus default to &quot;keep&quot;. The AFD decision may also include a strong recommendation for an additional action such as a &quot;merger&quot; or &quot;redirect&quot;. In many cases, the decision to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; may be conditional on the community's acceptance of the additional action. These recommendations do represent the community consensus and also should not be overturned lightly. However, these are actions which can be taken by any editor and do not require &quot;admin powers&quot;. If they are challenged, the decision should be discussed and decided on the respective article Talk pages. A second AFD discussion is unnecessary.&quot;

You continue to make statements in bad faith and revert things without consensus, why should anyone trust you? Davidpdx 10:21, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

::Davidpdx, You are way off base again.  I'm not 131.211.51.34 and my only intention is to bring &quot;balance to the force&quot; so to speak. Hope that Star Wars expresion humors you a little.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 19:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

Keep but rewrite.207.47.122.10 08:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
 
Just another bad faith move by you. I'm going to start documenting all the bs that you are doing and report it. I couldn't care less what your response is, so don't bother giving one:

I protest the vote from 207.47.122.10. This is clearly the IP address of Johnski, the main person involved in vandalizing numerous pages on Wikipedia. He is adding several pages in order to push DOM and make it seem legitimate. Each person has one vote on a rfd. It's time Johnski learns to follow the rules. Davidpdx 13:16, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

== Wikilante ==

I started this article and hope that someone will help to improve it:

A [[Wikilante]] is a [[rogue]] member of the Wikipedian community that takes matters into his/her own hands by blocking honest attempts to improve an article. The word Wikilante was inspired by the meaning of [[Vigilante]]. It was developed as a result of wikilante behavior on certain controversial articles published on Wikipedia. It is not to be confused with those dedicated Wikipedians that vigilantly revert vandalism, and attempt to block disruptive behavior.

: Why don't you just follow the rules instead?  You do recognize that while this behavior bothers you, protecting the Wiki is considered a value around here, not an undesirable thing.

Dear Davidpdx, you and your ilk have inspired me to create a new article, [[Wikilante]].  I hope the fact that you have been the primary cause of this, causes you to give pause, and see how you have become a vigilante. I'm sure under different circumstances, we could be friends, and I still hope that we can forgive each other, and move in that direction. Hurry, rush and nominate it for deletion before someone else does. Sincerely[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 07:56, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:You know that could qualify as taunting, which could get you banned. I'd very much caution you on your tone. Yes, you are correct I am keeping track of what is going on and I am very vigilant.

There is consensus and glad to see we cleared up part of our misunderstanding
Dear Davidpdx, there is consensus over the fact that the Iroijlaplap of Taongi did grant DOM a 50 years sovereign lease, so please stop removing that fact from the article. It is in the protected article and has been in every article about DOM for months.

I'm glad that we were able to clear up that I had reason to believe you had approved one of the versions here. Thank you for your honesty. SincerelyJohnski 17:50, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

Dear David, would you be interested in mediation under a wiki mediator?  If so this could avoid the more difficult process of arbitration. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 07:20, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:No, there is nothing to talk about. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 08:05, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

::Dear David, What reason? What about the fact that you just reverted a perfectly good version about Taongi after I proved there is consensus for the facts described about Melchizedek and you called it vandalism after a third party suggested you stop that behavior? Do you prefer arbitration?[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 15:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:::If that's what you want, bring it on. I'm sure there will be more the a couple people willing to attest to your behavior. I'm not the only person who has reverted you vandalism. There are at least 5 or 6 other legitimate users that have reverted the vandalism by you and your sockpuppets. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 16:40, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

::::Mediation is a better means of resolving this matter than artibtation. I'd prefer to work this out with you man to man, but since you are unwilling to try, the first approach according to what has been suggested to me by other Wikipedians, is mediation, but if you refuse to participate it is impossible for a mediator to help us. If we end up in arbitration, I think your unwillingness to accept mediation will work against you.  There are no witnesses needed because the record speaks for itself. Have you read how Mediation works here?  I suggest you read that before making your final decision for refusal to mediate our differences. [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 05:47, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::As I have stated and once again you have IGNORED the fact, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE REVERTING YOUR vandalism. You should wake up and see that there are MANY users that have a problem with you NOT JUST ME. Are you that ignorant that you can't understand that? [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 01:09, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::Once again, you have misrepresented the truth. First of all, arbitration is a &quot;last resort&quot; based on what I read. Second, you are sadly mistaken that there are no witnesses. In truth, the both sides have the chance to make a statement to make their points. Third, I see do not see ANYWHERE where it says that someone's unwillingness to accept mediation would work against them. Fourth, threatening to take some one to arbitration is in bad taste, lacks good faith and is plain wrong. I realize the first thing out of your mouth will be to deny the fact that you threatened me with arbitration, but there is now a record of it on both your talk page as well as mine. Fifth, I'm not the one that created an article critical of specific people on Wikipedia (Wikilante). Again, this is something that is in fact on record that you did and you can't deny it. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 10:52, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::Dear David, I don't want to piss you off, that is not my intention. Oh, yes, there is a record of that too, and that you again called me a liar while I'm trying to get you to act with proper Wikiquette. I noticed that you dinn't thank me for bring COOL to you attention below.  I just want to make peace with you and have honest, progressive dialog with you. I really don't know how i have misrepresented the truth. You pointed, out that arbitration is a &quot;last resort&quot; based on what you read, and that is why I'm suggesting that we ask the help of a mediator. You said that I am sadly mistaken that there are no witnesses, but what I mean is that what we have published is the only witness that we need and it is 100% perfect, unlike human witnesses. It is just my opinion that your unwillingness to accept mediation will work against you. It shows my good faith, and your lack thereof. I wasn't threatening to take you to arbitration, only let you know that that would be my next step (last resort) if you don't accept mediation. Would you prefer I just start arbitration without my giving you the opportunity to reconsider mediation?  I didn't mean it in a way to threatened you! Why would I deny the fact that I wrote to you my only remedy is arbitration if you don't accept mediation, and why would I not know there is now a record of it on both your talk page as well as mine?  That again is my point that the record is the only witness needed. For mediation there isn't any witness needed, but the record will help the mediator to figure out what is going on between us and give him/her ideas of what direction to go in finding a solution between us.  I didn't mention your name on the article I created for Wikipedia (Wikilante), you only gave me the idea from your Vigilante behavior.  Remember, I also complimented you for your vigilance.  I'll say it again, I admire your vigilance even though it verged if not became what I call Wikilanteism. Again, this is something that is in fact on record that I'm proud of, can't deny it, but neither can you deny the things you have written. BTW, mediation isn't binding, it is only for a third party to help us work out our differences.  Arbitration is binding. Cordially, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 05:02, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

== Wikilante ==

09:38, 27 October 2005 Sjakkalle deleted &quot;Wikilante&quot; (content was: '&lt;nowiki&gt;{{deletebecause|Recreated after speedy deletion, created by a disgruntled user}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;A Wikilante is a rogue member of the Wikipedian community that takes ...') 

Hello, Sjakkalle, I'm not distruntled. I am disapointed by the phenomena of wikilantism I found from another member of this community, and think the newly created word helps to identify that activity. After creating it, it dawned on me that bringing it to the wikilante's attention, he might communicate with me, which worked a little.  When I went to look at the article newly created it was gone, so published it again, but since found the deletion notice after finding it gone once more. Is it possible to suggest this as an article? Can you help me to mediate with the one showing the Wikilante behavior.[[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 07:14, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
:Sorry no, my skills at mediating are not the best in the world and my time is limited right now I'm afraid. If you want to protest against what you view as roguish behaviour, I suggest that you talk to the person politely and explain your concerns. If that fails, look at some of the suggestions at [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]], and in most cases the thing will be solved peaceably. In any case, it is important to keep a [[WP:COOL|cool]] head because making articles targeted against a user in the article namespace only results in unnecesarily escalating the tensions further, and we don't what that do we?

hi, in response to your message, as you'll see my only edit was changing &quot;United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]&quot; to &quot;[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]&quot;, as part of a clean up of links.

You have been requested to appear as a defendant in an arbitration case against you. You can file any comments on your own behalf at: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#User:Johnski_et_al.]
[[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 08:42, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

I have posted a long reply on the DOM talk page. You should fix the comments you made so they do not intrude on others. As I stated on the talk page, it makes it difficult to see who said what when someone does that.

I also pointed out, no one should be editing the article while we are waiting for a decision from arbitration. If you persist, I'll ask for a TRO or for the page to be protected again. This should be common sense. It would be nice gesture if you would refrain from editing any of the articles mentioned in the arbitration filing. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 13:41, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

Just to let you know, you should't be commenting on other peoples statements in arbitration. I made the same mistake and it was removed by one of the arbitration committee members shortly after I put a comment under your statement. You recently put a statement under Gene_Poole's comments and I commented under your rebuttle that your comments should also be removed. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 14:49, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

= WP Article =

I wouldn't get too excited at this point. I may have jumped the gun at offering this as a solution. At best, it seems like I'm getting a lackluster response in terms of a consensus. If I could put together a group of at least four people (five including you and myself), that would agree this should be changed, I'd do it. At this point, if I did make the change I feel it's going to cause the situation to blow up and get worse. 

Honestly, looking at the arbitration page, it appears that the case is going to be heard and pretty soon. Last time I looked it was 3/1/0 which means one more vote is needed to hear the case. There is one other case in line ahead of us, so I think that by the end of the week this is going to go forward. Right now, I'm asking for a cease fire. As I said, I've left messages with several other people and I'm not hearing anyone that is wild about the idea. I wish I could have come up with something. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 13:47, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:I would not blame Gene for the lack of consensus, others have not answered messages left on their talk page or questioned why we should change it. At least one is &quot;away&quot; for awhile. I know you don't want to hear this, but there are some serious things that do need to be worked out in arbitration. I'm not going to go into the reasons, because it's pointless, second because it's repetitive (in fact they have been said over and over again). At this point, it's the only thing I can say. I do believe we are close to getting some movement on the arbitration case. It is logical to wait a few days and see what happens. [[User:Davidpdx|Davidpdx]] 11:03, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

== Hatred for Christian Science? ==

I'm tired of playing your games.

In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Johnski&amp;diff=31093536&amp;oldid=31083827 this edit], you state, &quot;Certainly your hatred for Christian Science affects your judgment here?&quot;  That's completely unfounded and irrelevant, to boot.

As long as you let such unfounded and irrational comments stand, I will not participate in discussions with you other than where may be necessary on an article talk page, since it is clear that you will willingly ignore what I say, misread what I say, add your own opinions and assumptions to what I say, and misrepresent what I say.  Since I have never said anything about Christian Science, it ought to be clear to anyone that that is the case here.  In the future I suggest that if you want to assert anything on Wikipedia about my feelings, opinions, or previous statements that you post a link to a diff confirming what you are saying or else not say it. [[User:Jdavidb|Jdavidb]] ([[User_talk:Jdavidb|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Jdavidb|contribs]]) 21:01, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:Your [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jdavidb&amp;diff=31109705&amp;oldid=31095099 response] contains additional unfounded statements.  I'll point them out and even offer some response.  I may not do so in the future.  Again, I point out your practice of willingly ignoring, misreading, adding your own opinions and assumptions, and misrepresenting what I say.  If you'll limit yourself to stating things I've said or things you can somehow document, you can probably overcome this problem.

:Example: &quot;Isn't it normal for members of your church to hate Christian Science?&quot;  Before making such a statement, it would be advisable to look around for some statement from myself, my church, or my church's leaders to show that belief.  You won't find one.  If you'll set for yourself this rule: &quot;I will not post anything without a link to evidence backing up why I think it is the case,&quot; you'll help yourself overcome this problem.  In this case, after searching around for awhile, you would hopefully have begun to realize there is no evidence for thinking this way, and that you are relying on an assumption with no basis at all.

:The answer to your disingenuous and irrelevant question is &quot;No.&quot;  The question you want to ask yourself is: &quot;Why did I have the idea that it was normal for members of the same church as Jdavidb to hate Christian Science, since I've never actually read anything to that effect and, in fact, if pressed couldn't possibly provide a link to a place where any of them has said something like that?&quot;

:You'll note that the above paragraph is the first time I have ever made any statement about the Church of Christ, Scientist, anywhere on Wikipedia.  If you were under the impression I had ever said anything else, it is because you are willfully reading your own assumptions into my deliberate silence.

:I may or may not choose to dignify your future comments with a response, at my discretion.  I likely will not.

:In fact, I hereby request that you refrain from posting on my talk page again, unless it is to admit to and retract any of your previous behavior that I have documented in the evidence page in the arbitration proceeding against you.

::Dear Jdavidb, Now that you have stated that you do not hate Christian Science, I apologize to you and to every member of your chuch for publishing those types of questions here.  I had a friend that was a member of your church that told me he hated Christian Science. He wasn't so friendly after he learned of my faith, but that was many years ago, and of course, he doesn't speak for you or any other member of your church. 

::After reading through our exchanges, I further question whether you made the following statements off the cuff, because it seems you had no idea that the Melchizedek Bible and therefore the religion of DOM is somehow based on the writings of Mary Baker Eddy, &quot;I see no grain of truth there&quot;... &quot;the religious claims are utterly without merit and would probably be theologically irrelevant even if they had any merit.&quot;  I don't suppose you really want to study the writings of Mary Baker Eddy or read the entire Melchizedek Bible before you express opinions like that, do you? In order to demonstrate that you had some basis for making such opinions, can you tell us what the Melchizedekian religious claims are? That of course will not prove that you knew the claims at the time you gave such an opinion, but it will show that you are making an effort to show good faith on your part. If a person gives an opinion in a public forum like this, he should be prepared to explain the basis for such an opinion.

::This is a game to you but NOT to me. Cordially, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 01:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

:I very much appreciate your apology.  In turn, I offer what apology I can for any member of my church who might have said hateful things to you, though just as they cannot speak for me, I also cannot speak for them.  I am sorry that it happened, though.
:Here's all I know about the alleged &quot;religion&quot; of DOM:
:#They claim to have a &quot;translation&quot; of the Bible, but clearly don't know what a translation is.  What they have instead produced is a commentary or &quot;study Bible.&quot;  It could perhaps be called a paraphrase, but given the clear intent to introduce original thought rather than reflect the concepts expressed by the original authors, it is by no means a translation.
:#:Given this fact, that they are either ignorant of what a &quot;translation&quot; is, or else willing to play fast and loose with the definition in order to imply more significance to their &quot;Bible,&quot; they clearly have nothing to offer in the realm of religious scholarship.
:#They claim to be a &quot;sovreignty&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; of Melchizedek, restored from Bible times.  Since no such such nation is mentioned in Scripture, let alone designated as significant, this is another irrelevant religious claim.
:#They claim to be based off of the religion of Christian Science.
:#They've been connected to widescale banking fraud.
:That's all I need to know.  In order to ascertain their religious significance, either #1 or #2 is all I need to know. [[User:Jdavidb|Jdavidb]] ([[User_talk:Jdavidb|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Jdavidb|contribs]]) 04:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

Couple more comments:

It might be wise not to assume you know the general attitude or belief of any particular church or religion based on what any one member says.  In my experience you have to have a lot of data points to know what a religion beliefs: official texts and statements, perspective from practicing officials or teachers of the religion, perspective of multiple average members, and perspective from members in different locations due to differences in geography.  These different data points don't always agree.  If you've only got a statement from one person, you almost never have enough to determine what a particular religion believes.

All my life until a couple of years ago my grandparents lived across the street from a couple who were members of Christian Science.  They had the same surname as my fourth grade science teacher who often made comments that made me think he was probably also a member of Christian Science, and I suspect possibly a relative of theirs.  My grandparents always spoke fondly of that couple, though they never got to be more than just neighborhood acquaintances.  There was never any animosity over religion in evidence from either side, and certainly not hatred.

:::I very much appreciate your apology too.  

:::I'm not going to try to change your mind about what you have written, but just to let you know that I found their[http://www.melchizedek.com/mz_bible/mb_pref.htm Preface] to clearly set forth what their work is, and it is not misleading to me. Since I actually took the time to read it, and the entire work, it seemed to do what it claims to do, i.e. interpret the metaphor, etc. It seems like a genuine effort to me.

:::Genesis, Psalms and Hebrews seem to teach that the government of Melchizedek is both sovereign and eternal. Being that Melchizsedek is an etneral king (sovereign) and has an (eternal) territory, Jerusalem (or the entire earth) or if you look at Daniel 7 &quot;Dominion will be given to the Saints.&quot;  I find their concept both compelling and biblical. Have you seen the opinion letter [http://www.melchizedek.com/legal.htm] published on the DOM web site written by one Geoffrey Thayer, JD which goes into this stuff, and about their claim to the entire earth based on scriptures? Their efforts seem to have no less authority than any other religion, just that they haven't been doing it as long as the ones that are more venerable.

:::If you study the subject more carefully you will see that it is only some banks they have licensed that have been connected to widescale banking fraud not the DOM itself. The vatican had its own banking scandal. I really don't see what banking fraud has to do with their religious faith. I can't find where they teach people to enter into banking business for fraud. And it doesn't appear that there is any ongoing fraud by their banking community, as the news of that stuff is about 5 years old.
 
:::I agree with you that I went too far in asking the questions I did of you based on one personal experience, and appreciate your sharing with me your own experiences. Sincerely, [[User:Johnski|Johnski]] 05:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Blocking ==

Have you seen the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Johnski/Proposed decision|proposed arbcom ruling]]? It says, &quot;The locus of this dispute is edit warring and POV editing of Dominion of Melchizedek and related articles. The edit warring is sustained, and marked by aggressive editing by Johnski and a host of apparent associates.&quot;

Then it says, &quot;Johnski, and his numerous puppets, are reasonably believed to be associated with the Dominion of Melchizedek and are capable of using a wide variety of IPs to access Wikipedia.&quot;

And finally, &quot;Dominion of Melchizedek and associated articles, shall be semi-protected. If necessary, Johnski, or any other editor believed by an administrator to be a sockpuppet or meatpuppet of Johnski, may be blocked indefinitely by any administrator.&quot; 

You have three times inserted the same thing against consensus. I am blocking you indefinitely. [[User:Tom harrison|Tom Harrison]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tom harrison|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

:Dear Tom: Is it really true that one person, Davidpdx, can determine consensus? He reverted without giving a valid reason. I asked him and he said that I was a known DOM person or something like that which isn't true (only can be assumed) and that the edition was whitewashing, without any explanation as to which part he considered whitewash. Was it the part that said the State Dept called DOM a fraud that he considered &quot;whitewashing&quot; or quoting from CBS? or adding the word &quot;country&quot; to the &quot;non-existent&quot; reference to the SEC? By the way, that is more accurate because it is the last word by the SEC. If Davidpdx would give logical reasons helping me to understand his concerns, we wouldn't have ended up in arbcom.

: You asked me if I would intervene here.  I've thought about it and decided that it would be inappropriate.

: I think you need to take notice of the arbitration case.  If you want to return to Wikipedia and edit somewhere else, just open an account and do so, but it appears that your behavior during editing of the Melchizadek  article has found to be comprehensively bad for the encyclopedia and you should stop trying to have anything to do with it.
