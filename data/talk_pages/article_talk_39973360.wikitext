==Comment==
Much of this article outiside of the intro seems to be copy/pasted from the GopherSports.com (see Sources section)article on the subject and then changed slightly. The text in question was added on 9 June 2006. [[User:Davidt2718|Davidt2718]] 19:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== New Page needed ==
There needs to be a &quot;UW-UM/UM-UW rivalry&quot; page created, with the &quot;Slab of Bacon&quot; and &quot;Paul Bunyan's Axe&quot; pages cited with &quot;main&quot; links in subsections.  Neither one of the current pages incorporates the full history of the rivalry (and it is a historic one).  For listing purposes, the trophies should be cited in subsections of the overall rivalry page.

Should more information be added to this article?  The gophersports article seems to have some decent info, but shouldn't just be plagiarized.  Any good sources would be appreciated.[[User:Polkapolkapoker|Polkapolkapoker]] 00:24, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:BuckyBadgerGraphic.gif|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

I will try to do that in the next couple of days (I'll have to read the fair use policy to see if it can be done for this image), but please note that deleting only that image gives more weight to Minnesota in this Minnesota-Wisconsin rivalry.  If one goes, both go, fair use or not, simply for a balanced article.[[User:Polkapolkapoker|Polkapolkapoker]] 11:19, 2 June 2007 (UTC)

does anyone what year they replaced the orginial axe with current all wood (?) one.

I'm a current resident of Madison and a recent graduate from the UW, as well as photographer for The Daily Cardinal.

[[:Paul Bunyan&amp;#39;s Axe]] → {{no redirect|Minnesota–Wisconsin football rivalry}} – The rivalry has been renewed almost every year since 1890 except for 1906. That's well before either the Slab of Bacon or Paul Bunyan's Axe were created in 1930 and 1948, respectively.

== The 1892 game &quot;debate&quot; ==
[[File:Original 1948 Paul Bunyan's Axe (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|350px|The original Paul Bunyan's Axe from 1948 displays a 4-32 score on the handle for the 1892 game. (Click to zoom)]]
So people have been changing the overall score of the series based off one article by ''Brian Lucas'' from 2011 (link below). The basis for his claim of a Badgers victory was a mention from a [http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/wis/blog/1901Minnesota0002.jpg 1901 game program] where it says the 1892 game was a 40-32 Badgers victory. Now, something that has been, imo, grossly overlooked is the fact that the 1892 game has two contemporary newspaper mentions that can be found digitally. One from the ''Milwaukee Journal'' on October 31, 1892 and one from the ''Saint Paul Sunday Globe'' on October 30, 1892. Both mention a Badgers loss. These are, to my knowledge, the only references from the game in the year in which it was played that are available online. I'm sure local libraries might have digital copies or something though.
&lt;div style=&quot;width:850px&quot;&gt;
Sources state that in 1892 the Badgers lost to Minnesota (differing scores though some say 4-32 and others 4-34).

::''Wisconsin Defeated.''
::''The Wisconsin University Football team played its second scheduled game saturday afternoon with the University of Minnesota at Madison. The Wisconsin team was badly handicapped as some of its best men were unable to play, and as a result the visitors won an easy game by a score of 32 to 4. The first half closed with the score 8 to 4 in favor of Minneapolis. In the second half the home team forced the ball towards the visitors' goal and Krenshaw was within a few feet of the goal line when he was tacked[sic] and in the struggle his leg was broken above the ankle.''

::''Minnesota Footballers Defeat the Wisconsin Team.''
::''Madison, Wis., Oct. 29-The football game between the Minnesota and Wisconsin teams resulted in a victory for the former by a score of 34 to 4. The Wisconsin team was handicapped by having six of its heaviest men in the hospital, the result of the Purdue game. About 1,000 people witnessed the game. Krnshaw[sic] left guard for Wisconsin, had his right ankle broken in the second half. Bruised and torn faces, broken fingers and sprains were the special features of the game.''

*Golden Gophers website [http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/m-footbl-sched-1892-93.html Minnesota Football - 1892 schedule] (score 4-32)

The only thing that states that in 1892 the Badgers beat Minnesota 40-32 is the Brian Lucas article. And in his article he says that he emailed both the UM and UW athletic departments and they changed their records based off his findings.
