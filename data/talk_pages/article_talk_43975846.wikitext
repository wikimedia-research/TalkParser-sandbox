== Quality problems ==

I strongly doubt that a wording like &quot;the Chicom&quot; is appropriate on an encyclopaedic point of view. A cleanup of the language may be sensible. Regards, [[User:Grand-Duc|Grand-Duc]] ([[User talk:Grand-Duc|talk]]) 19:52, 3 February 2013 (UTC)

== History Book ==

A mostly pictorial history of the USS Hanson in 1965 is available on the Apple IBooks webstore. It is readable on Apple IPad because it is a &quot;Multi touch&quot; book. It s easily found by searching the store for &quot;William J. Riley&quot; and &quot;DD - 832&quot;.
