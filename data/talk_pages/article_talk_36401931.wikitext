== Mini-documentary - Info posted by an editor with a [[WP:COI]] ==

I've got a conlict of interest.  I attended the event as a delegate and contributed money to funding a mini-documentary about it. The mini-doc is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlhm3iM_s8o here], on youtube. A non-conflicted editor may find useful information there. There's a bit more information about it [http://www.the99declaration.org/html/epilogue.html here]. [[User:David in DC|David in DC]] ([[User talk:David in DC|talk]]) 16:59, 19 August 2013 (UTC)

== Edit suggestion from a COI editor ==

A) The event was held from July 2-4.  The sources confirm this.  However, at one point in the article, it says June 2-4. It's just a typo, I'm guessing, but someone other than me ought to fix it.
B) Some verb tenses may need changing in the article. [[User:David in DC|David in DC]] ([[User talk:David in DC|talk]]) 17:04, 19 August 2013 (UTC)
