==Speedy deletion of [[:Siamese Dream (band)]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Siamese Dream (band)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (music)|notability guideline for musical topics]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Siamese Dream (band)|the page]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Siamese Dream (band)|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

==AfD nomination of Brandon Locher==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|48px|]]An editor has nominated [[Brandon Locher]], an article on which you have worked or that you created, for [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion]].  We appreciate your contributions, but the nominator doesn't believe that the article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion and has explained why in his/her nomination (see also &quot;[[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot;).  

Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at {{#if:Brandon Locher | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brandon Locher]] | [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brandon Locher]] }} and please be sure to [[WP:SIG|sign your comments]] with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  

You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the [[WP:AfD|articles for deletion]] template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate.  Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:AFDNote --&gt; [[User:BJBot|BJBot]] ([[User talk:BJBot|talk]]) 12:44, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
