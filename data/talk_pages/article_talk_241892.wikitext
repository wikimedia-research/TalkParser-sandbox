==Dates==
Am I being thick or does the date 2001 at the start of 'History' not make sense?  Is that 1901?

Hmm. This needs lots of fact-checking, and appears to have a definite POV. More editing required. See http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/coachsci/swimming/bodysuit/science.htm for some background info: I can't find the original paper online. [[User:The Anome|The Anome]] 22:06 7 Jun 2003 (UTC)

I just threw in a line about the vernacular use of speedo to refer to any tight, brief-style swimsuit, kind of like how Kleenex refers to any kind of tissue.[[User:Samnell|Samnell]] 20:31, May 16, 2004 (UTC)

== Image size ==
Hi,

I reverted the change to the image size, mainly because it wasn't displaying.  It is now.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Speedo&amp;oldid=27940241]

I prefer the smaller size, Trollderella perfers the larger, I just thought I'd ask for a straw poll?

What do ''you'' think?  Regards, [[User:BenAveling|Ben Aveling]] 21:24, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
:I'm really not that bothered, I thought the larger looked better because it was the same size as the logo, but the small looks fine too. [[User:Trollderella|Trollderella]] 23:28, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

I think the photo of a man in a speedo is a bit gay. Probably more female speedo swimsuits are sold, anyway, so why not put a picture of a woman in a speedo swimsuit, or even a woman and a man, as in most of the catalogue pictures?

How can a photo be gay? Does it only have sex with other photos? [[User:Smurfmeister|Smurfmeister]] ([[User talk:Smurfmeister|talk]]) 19:38, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

== Proposed merger ==
Articles about the type of suit should be merged to [[Speedo (suit style)]], not to this article about the manufacturer. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 22:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)


== External Links ==
The essay &quot;Baggy-Pants Thuggery &amp; Hip-Hop Burlesque: Clothing as Sexual Politics in America&quot; is an apporximately 5000-word piece in which &quot;Speedo&quot; is only mentioned two or three times, and rather tangentially at that.  I believe links should be restricted to resources that deal directly and primarily with the subject.  I will wait to hear possible arguments for keeping it before I remove it. [[User:Jvward|Jvward]] 18:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

== Stars and Stripes ==
There ought to be a section on the famous ''Stars and Stripes'' design that Speedo created in 1968, and which Mark Spitz wore on his historic 7 gold medal year. Speedo re-introduced it in 2003 (?), I think. A photo would be desirable, as well. I believe that the original suit that Spitz wore is now in the Smithsonian, in Washington D.C.

:Can you add what you know? Are there any sources for this info? There's a chance that thre's a PD picture of Spitz in the suit, but it's doubtful. However, if we can find a good link to it that's almost as good. If the whole team wore the suits that increases the chances.  -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] · [[User talk:Will Beback|†]] · 06:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:Is this the suit? [http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slika:Mark_Spitz.jpg] -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] · [[User talk:Will Beback|†]] · 06:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
::Yes; that is the suit. That photo, which appeared in ''Life'' Magazine, was reproduced all over the world, and hung on countless women's college dorm rooms (and plenty guys' as well). If it is fair use, it should be uploaded into this article, as I think it is arguably the most famous photograph of a Speedo. This suit is the 100 per cent nylon version. Speedo also made it in the Nylon/Lycra material which has since become more popular around the world. I believe I misstated the year above. It was 1972 (not 1968), the year that Spitz became the only athlete ever to win the gold medal in every event in which he competed, and to establish a new world record in each event as well. Seven gold medals in all. [[User:66.108.105.21|66.108.105.21]] 06:25, 6 January 2007 (UTC) Allen Roth

:::Unfortunately it is not fair use. Furthermore, I couldn't even find a copy to link to that was hosted by a site that wasn't violating copyright. (Unfortunately, that includes our own Hungarian Wikipedia). I checked the TIME website, but their images of Spitz didn't show the suit. In any case, you can still describe it. I'm sure many readers will know exactly what is meant even without a photo. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] · [[User talk:Will Beback|†]] · 07:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

== Explanation lacking ==

There is no explanation as to why this article is redirected from the term &quot;Budgie Smuggler&quot; (a comical reference to the shape of the male parts enclosed in the Speedo resembling the shape that a budgerigar would make under the same circumstances).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/125.238.88.126|125.238.88.126]] ([[User talk:125.238.88.126|talk]]) 04:09, 14 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Ownership ==

The summary box refers to Speedo being part of the Warnaco group. This is not the case; Warnaco is the US licensee of the brand. Speedo was acquired by the Pentland Group in 1990 - see this article &lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9334351.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentland Group's ownership of Speedo is stated on the corporate site of both Pentland Group and Speedo.


One could also refer to [http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9Mzc4NjUyfENoaWxkSUQ9Mzc3ODc0fFR5cGU9MQ==&amp;t=1 Warnaco's corporate info]. As stated earlier, Warnaco owns a perpetual license to design, manufacture, merchandise, and sell the speedo label in United States, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean Islands.

I read the article that was referenced saying Warnaco &quot;owns&quot; speedo. For all intents and purposes, to the Western World and the common man, that is the case. In a matter of technicality or legality, it is not. Warnaco should be considered the &quot;parent&quot; company of [http://www.SpeedoUSA.com SpeedoUSA]. Furthermore, a distinction should be made between SpeedoUSA (the Warnaco label) and [http://www.speedo.com Speedo International] (the Pentland Group label).

== Article overhaul ==

If anyone is interested, I am working on a major rewrite of this article. For clarification: the company Speedo International Ltd is a subsidiary of Pentland Group. They license the Speedo name to Warnaco for use in North America. The rewrite will follow Speedo International. Once completed, I will put the article up under the title Speedo International Limited and propose this article be deleted since &quot;Speedo&quot; is technically just a brand name and not a company. Suggestions, tips, and shared research is welcome on the discussion page for [[User:Brendanmccabe/SpeedoInternational]] but please don't mess with the article itself until I can finish it. Thank you. 


== January 2011 overhaul ==

I completely scrapped the old &quot;Speedo&quot; article and replaced it with this one. Comments and criticisms are welcome.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brendanmccabe|Brendanmccabe]] ([[User talk:Brendanmccabe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brendanmccabe|contribs]]) 05:04, 23 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Thanks for doing that work. Three points: I haven't looked at the old article, but is everything of value from it included in this version? Second, the commonly used name of the company appears to be &quot;Speedo&quot;. Am I wrong? Lastly, if you're not done with the article, and don't want others messing with it, then maybe it'd be better to move it back to your user page until it's ready for other editors. &amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;[[User:Will Beback|&lt;font color=&quot;#595454&quot;&gt;Will Beback&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp; [[User talk:Will Beback|&lt;font color=&quot;#C0C0C0&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt; 05:58, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

::The previous article contained a lot of misinformation and was poorly sourced. However, anything that was relevant and/or accurate was incorporated into this article (with better sources). The common name for the company is &quot;Speedo&quot; but one of the things that prompted me to rewrite the article was the confusion over who owns what and who makes what. In writing my [[Warnaco Group]] article, I discovered that they have the exclusive North American license on the Speedo name. However, Warnaco is often misrepresented as Speedo's parent company. Warnaco's division for handling the license is called Speedo USA; the true name of the company - and the reason for this article's name - is Speedo International Limited. As far as the article's completion... Have at it! [[User:Brendanmccabe|Brendanmccabe]] ([[User talk:Brendanmccabe|talk]]) 16:30, 23 January 2011 (UTC)
::Oh, there is one more thing: I want to include a picture of the original [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/08/12/swimsuit.jpg Fastskin suit], but I can't seem to find a free image. My email to Speedo International was responded to by a bot.[[User:Brendanmccabe|Brendanmccabe]] ([[User talk:Brendanmccabe|talk]]) 16:51, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

== Sponsored athletes... ==

I couldn't think of a &quot;slick&quot; way to add this to the article, but Seebohm and Kromowidjojo are no longer sponsored by Speedo, and are now Arena athletes isntead. Links: http://www.arenainternational.com/en/press/arena-signs-sponsorship-deal-with-rising-australian-swimming-star-emily-seebohm and http://www.arenainternational.com/en/press/arena-signs-olympic-champion-ranomi-kromowidjojo . I have removed them from the lists.[[User:HatBucketBalls|HatBucketBalls]] ([[User talk:HatBucketBalls|talk]]) 16:00, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

:That's all you had to do. Thanks for the maintenance! --[[User:Brendanmccabe|Brendanmccabe]] ([[User talk:Brendanmccabe|talk]]) 19:46, 1 April 2011 (UTC)
