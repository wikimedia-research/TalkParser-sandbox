==Image copyright problem with Image:Maniratnam.jpg==

Thank you for uploading [[:Image:Maniratnam.jpg]]. However, it currently is missing information on its copyright status. Wikipedia takes [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] very seriously. It may be deleted soon, unless we can determine the '''license''' and the '''source''' of the image. If you know this information, then you can add a '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|copyright tag]]''' to the [[Help:Image page|image description page]].

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|media copyright questions page]]. Thanks again for your cooperation. [[User:Shyam Bihari| &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''Shyam'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Shyam Bihari|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''T'''&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Shyam Bihari|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''C'''&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 06:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

==Speedy deletion of [[:David Immanuel]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:David Immanuel]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guideline for biographies]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:David Immanuel|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:David Immanuel|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-bio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Ttonyb1|ttonyb1]] ([[User talk:Ttonyb1|talk]]) 17:44, 13 April 2009 (UTC)
