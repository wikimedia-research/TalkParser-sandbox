[[File:ToolbarSignVector.png|right]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Century Gothic';&quot;&gt;This is your [[Help:Talk page|'''Talk page''']] where you can receive messages from other [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]] and discuss things with them. At the end of your messages you should always enter your signature by signing with four [[Wikipedia:Signatures|'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''']] or by pressing the button in the editor shown here in the picture. By the way, it is not necessary to sign edits that you make in the articles themselves as [[Wikipedia:Sign#When signatures should and should not be used|''those messages will be deleted'']]. My name is Brendon. If you have any questions or face any initial hurdles, post {{tlx|helpme|your question}} on [[User talk:VeritosNow|your talk page]] (this page), someone will quickly come up and attend to your query. And also, feel free to contact me on [[user talk:Brendon111|my talk page]] and I will do what I can to assist.

&lt;!-- Welcome Template --&gt;


===Little tips to make discussions easier to read and understand===
Hi VeritosNow,&lt;br&gt; I wanted to share some tips with you on how to edit talkpages. Before we go any further, as a precautionary step, I'd like to humbly remind you that there are some things which [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not]], e.g. a [[WP:NOTFORUM|forum]] or a [[WP:NOTGOSSIP|soapbox]] or a [[WP:NOTBLOG|blog]]. &lt;p&gt;So let's come to the point. It's important that you properly indent your comments while responding to others' comments on talk pages. Good [[WP:INDENT|indentation]] makes prolonged discussions easier to read and understand. It might be helpful to think of discussions as reports with numbered/bulleted sections and subsections where material is not necessarily written in chronological order. &lt;br /&gt;''See also'':
:[[WP:CUSTOMSIG]] 
::Signatures '''must''' include at least one internal link to your user page, user talk page, or contributions page; this allows other editors easy access to your talk page and contributions log. The lack of such a link is widely viewed as obstructive. If, while making modifications, you accidentally disable this link, click [[Wikipedia:How to fix your signature|here]]. When you insert your signature on your talk page or user page, a link to that page will appear black, bold and inactive, so test your signature elsewhere, such as the Sandbox.
::[[File:Pictogram voting comment.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] '''Note:'''&lt;!-- Template:EP --&gt; - ''Do not'' include links to external websites in your signature.
:[[WP:INDENT]] [[File:Indentation_highlight.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Highlighting the indentation button on edit toolbar]]
:#A reply should be placed beneath the original comment. The reply should be indented. To indent check your edit tool bar for a button like this â†’ &lt;sub&gt;[[Image:Vector_toolbar_indentation_button.png|20px]]&lt;/sub&gt;.
:#If two replies are made to one specific comment, they should be at the same level of indentation with the later reply at the bottom.
:#A response to a reply should be placed below that reply, but above all later replies. The response should be indented relative to the adjacent replies.
:#A new comment or sub-thread that is being added after a number of replies should go at the bottom. Do not add a new comment or sub-thread where it will separate an earlier comment from its replies.
I hope this helps. If you still need something else, don't worry and visit the &lt;tt&gt;[[User:Brendon111/Help|Help-page]]&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Brendon111|&lt;font style=&quot;color:Green;background:Yellow;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Brendon&amp;nbsp;is'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Brendon111|&lt;font style=&quot;color:White;background:red;&quot;&gt;'''here'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 11:05, 14 May 2012 (UTC)
