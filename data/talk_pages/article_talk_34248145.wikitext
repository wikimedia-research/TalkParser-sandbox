== Ascension ==

Is Ascension still celebrated on Thursday, even in areas where the local RC diocese celebrates it on Sunday? And in Canada? --[[User:Richardson mcphillips|Richardson mcphillips]] ([[User talk:Richardson mcphillips|talk]]) 01:09, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
:An alternative liturgy is assigned for Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter for celebration where the Feast of the Ascension is on the following Sunday. The 1962 Roman Missal, whose use is still authorized (with limitations if used for Masses with a congregation) has no Mass for that Thursday, other than the Mass of Ascension.  Guidance for someone celebrating Mass with that edition of the Roman Missal is provided [http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/Extraordinary/index.shtml here].  The ''Divine Worship'' of the personal ordinariates surely has an alternative liturgy for the Thursday in question.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 19:43, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
