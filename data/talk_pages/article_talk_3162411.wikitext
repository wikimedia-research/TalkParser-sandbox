Your statement that feminists only oppose gender inequality &quot;when it disadvantages women&quot; is POV.

The claim that feminists oppose gender inequality is POV. They've clearly done much to support and encourage gender inequality. If you insist on claiming that they oppose gender inequality that disadvantages men, why can't you give an example of a mainstream feminist organization ever doing so?
