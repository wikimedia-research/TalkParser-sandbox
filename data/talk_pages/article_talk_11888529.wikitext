{{#if:The scrungies|The article [[The scrungies]]|A music-related article}} you have recently written may not meet Wikipedia's generally accepted [[WP:MUSIC|criteria for inclusion of bands or musical acts]].  It has likely been marked for deletion.  Don't worry, there are several other options:

* Create an entry for your band on one of the many [[List of social networking websites|social networking websites]].
* Many [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] allow you to create your own website, often at no extra charge.
With the above options your band's page will be protected from being edited by others, unlike a Wikipedia article (which may be edited by anyone).
* You may create a wiki at '''[http://www.editthis.info/wiki/Main_Page EditThis.info]''' or one of the other [[Comparison of wiki farms|wiki farms]].
