==Commercial use of [[:Image:Dhammakaya stupa.jpg]]==
[[Image:Information_icon.svg|left]]Hello, this is a message from [[User:Android Mouse Bot 2|an automated bot]]. A tag has been placed on [[:Image:Dhammakaya stupa.jpg]], by {{#ifeq:{{{nom}}}|1|[[User:{{{nominator}}}|{{{nominator}}}]],}} another Wikipedia user, requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. The tag claims that it should be speedily deleted because [[:Image:Dhammakaya stupa.jpg]] is an image licensed as &quot;[[:Category:Non-commercial use only images|for non-commercial use only]]&quot; or &quot;[[:Category:Images used with permission|used with permission for use on Wikipedia only]]&quot; which was either uploaded on or after [[2005-05-19]] or is not used in any articles ([[WP:CSD#I3|CSD I3]]).

'''If you ''created'' this media file''' and want to use it on Wikipedia, you may re-upload it (or amend the image description if it has not yet been deleted) and use the license {{tl|GFDL-self}} to license it under the [[GFDL]], or {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}} to license it under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike license, or use {{tl|PD-self}} to release it into the public domain.

'''If you ''did not create'' this media file''' but want to use it on Wikipedia, there are two ways to proceed.  First, you may choose one of the fair use tags from [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Tagging fair use images|this list]] if you believe one of those [[fair use]] rationales applies to this file.  Second, you may want to contact the copyright holder and [[Wikipedia:Example requests for permission|request that they make the media available under a '''free''' license]].

If the article has already been deleted, see the advice and instructions at [[WP:WMD]]. '''This bot is only informing you of the nomination for speedy deletion, it did not nominate [[:Image:Dhammakaya stupa.jpg]] itself'''. Feel free to leave a message [[User talk:Android Mouse|on the bot operator's talk page]] if you have any questions about this or any problems with this bot. If you have any questions about what to do next or why your image was nominated for speedy deletion please ask at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. Thanks. --[[User:Android Mouse Bot 2|Android Mouse Bot 2]] 07:14, 28 May 2007 (UTC)
