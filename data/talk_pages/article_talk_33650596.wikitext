== Your submission at [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]] ==
[[File:Citaton-needed-vertical.svg|150px|right|link=Wikipedia:Citing sources]]

I noticed your submission in [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]], '''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Marie-Ange Somdah]]'''.  Thanks! It will be reviewed by a volunteer soon.

Before it can be added to Wikipedia, your submission should have references.  All articles on Wikipedia should have inline, numbered references after facts, showing the 'reliable source' (a newspaper, book, etc.) where the information can be checked, so that all information is [[WP:V|verifiable]].
[[File:Citing_sources_tutorial,_part_1.ogv|right|thumb|Here's a video tutorial - hit play, then right-click for &quot;full screen&quot;.]]

Here's an example of how to add references:
&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot; style=&quot;background:#def; border:1px solid #468; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em auto; background-color:#EBFFEB;&quot;&gt;Chzz is 98 years old.&amp;lt;ref&gt; &quot;The book of Chzz&quot;, Aardvark Books, 2009. &amp;lt;/ref&gt;

He likes tea.&amp;lt;ref&gt; Smith, John. &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://foonews.com/Article42 Interview with Chzz]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Foo News, 1 April 2010. Retrieved 2011-05-22.  &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;== References ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That makes the references automatically display as small numbers&lt;sup&gt;[{{colour|blue|1}}]&lt;/sup&gt; which will link to the details in the section titled == References == at the end.  You can [[User:ChzzBot IV/Example page with references|see that example in action here]].

Please add references to your submission, which will be reviewed as soon as possible. See also, [[Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners]]. If you need any help, just put {{tn|helpme}} at the end of ''this'' page, followed by a question or get into our live help chat chanel at {{IRC|wikipedia-en-help}}.

Hello Winmaldabire. It has been over six months since you last edited your article submission, entitled [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Marie-Ange Somdah|Marie-Ange Somdah]]. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Marie-Ange Somdah|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note, however, that Articles for Creation is not for the indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia mainspace.

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Marie-Ange Somdah&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, click &quot;Save&quot;, and an administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt; [[User:HasteurBot|HasteurBot]] ([[User talk:HasteurBot|talk]]) 23:02, 22 September 2013 (UTC)
