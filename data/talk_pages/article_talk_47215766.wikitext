[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Gilliam|Gilliam]]. Wikipedia is written by people who have a wide diversity of opinions, but we try hard to make sure articles have a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. Your recent edit  seemed less than neutral to me, so I removed it for now. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Gilliam|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-npov1 --&gt; â€“ [[User:Gilliam|Gilliam]] ([[User talk:Gilliam|talk]]) 00:42, 12 July 2015 (UTC)
