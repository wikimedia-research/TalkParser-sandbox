==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Fergal Moore]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Fergal Moore]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A3|section A3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an article with no content whatsoever, or whose contents consist only of external links, a &quot;See also&quot; section, book references, category tags, template tags, interwiki links, a rephrasing of the title, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. You may wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Fergal Moore|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Fergal Moore|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontent-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; -- [[User:BigDom|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#990033&quot;&gt;Big&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:BigDom|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#3BB0FF&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dom&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 20:25, 14 February 2010 (UTC)
