==Welcome!==
[[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|Welcome to Wikipedia]], [[Wikipedia|the free encyclopedia!]] You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia.  To acquire [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|additional privileges]], simply create an account.  It's free, requires no personal information, and lets you:
* '''[[Help:Starting a new page|Create new pages]]''', and customize the appearance and behavior of the website
* '''[[Wikipedia:How to rename a page|Rename pages]]'''
* Edit '''[[Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy|semi-protected pages]]'''
* '''[[Special:Upload|Upload images]]'''
* Have your own '''[[Wikipedia:Watchlist|watchlist]]''', which shows when articles you are interested in have changed
* Utililize a vast array of '''[[WP:JS|editing tools]]'''

And your [[IP address]] will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikipedian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. We also have an [[WP:TMM|intuitive guide on editing]] if you're interested. By the way, please make sure to [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign and date]] your comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''').  Happy editing!   &lt;/div&gt;
