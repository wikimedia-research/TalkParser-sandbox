== Amendments required ==

In the introduction it is stated that Minolta were probably best known for the first integrated auto-focus SLRs. This is opinion only. Ten years earlier (1977), Minolta were at least as well-known for the first multi-mode, computerised, programmed camera, the XD7 (which needs adding into '''Milestones''' - it seems to be missing).

Which leads on to the next bone of contention : all the model names listed are American. The XD-11 was unknown outside America, being badged as the XD7 in Britain, Europe, and possibly wider territories? Although this may seem an unimportant detail, the &quot;7&quot; designation was critical to Minolta's marketing strategy (which underlines the importance of the XD7), being carried forward to the X700, X7000, Dynax 7xi, etc. [[Special:Contributions/88.105.179.103|88.105.179.103]] ([[User talk:88.105.179.103|talk]]) 18:30, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

== About X-370s, please. ==

Greetings

I´m looking info about X-370s cameras. Would you, please, add it?

Thanks.

== Merge ==

Should the Minolta and the [[Konica]] articles be merged with the [[Konica Minolta]] article? Konica's talk page can be accessed [[Talk:Konica|here]] for convenience. --[[User:Mayfare|Mayfare]] 23:46, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:In short, no; but see my much longer comment at [[Talk:Konica]]. -- [[User:Hoary|Hoary]] 00:48, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

It's clear that the proposal to merge was overwhelmingly opposed. I've therefore removed the &quot;Shall we merge?&quot; templates from the articles. -- [[User:Hoary|Hoary]] ([[User talk:Hoary|talk]]) 23:23, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

== Autofocus SLR's Section question ==
Would whichever user put in the following JPEG:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Image:fogged hienegs.png|thumb|Infrared negatives fogged by the frame counter of a Minolta Maxxum 4.]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
please explain same using clearer language? FYI, it's impossible for a 'frame counter' (which only counts film frames) to fog film! Now if you want to say that:

::using a plastic camera body (versus a metal camera body) can fog infrared film

then please reword same.--[[User:MurderWatcher1|MurderWatcher1]] 20:58, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

Not my picture, but it is accurate. Early film SLRs used a gear that fit into the sprocket holes to detect the film position when advancing the film to the next frame. Modern film SLRs usually use an infrared beam to count the sprocket holes when advancing the film. The change occured when SLR cameras became more electronic and was about the time autofocus was introduced. 

However, IMO, this picture does not belong, there is no text regarding infrared photography. This picture might add to an acticle on infrared photography. [[User:Mattman944|Mattman944]] ([[User talk:Mattman944|talk]]) 06:07, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Text was added to article (referencing what I said above) by another person on 20 June 2009 so now picture is accurate and is appropriate. Issue resolved. [[User:Mattman944|Mattman944]] ([[User talk:Mattman944|talk]]) 14:23, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

== The Autofocusing 500mm Mirror Lens ==
Another comment I'm adding, separate to the above that I made.  Now if we could only get more images of these fine cameras, and will someone please, if possible, put in an image of a Minolta Maxxum SLR or DSLR with that fabulous autofocusing 500mm mirror lens? They were the only ones to produce this optic and Herbert Keppler of Popular Photography made a comment on this optic in that magazine. Sony now has this optic and I'm wondering why Canon and Nikon haven't responded.--[[User:MurderWatcher1|MurderWatcher1]] 21:35, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Minolta Colors&quot; ==
I've come across numerous uses of the phrase &quot;Minolta colors&quot; with regard to Minolta lenses, and people use the phrase as if they expect readers to know what it means.  IMO, this phenomenon is notable enough that it belongs in the article.  However, I haven't been able to find a source that really nails down what &quot;Minolta colors&quot; actually means.  Any suggestions?

== Infobox ==

Why does this have an infobox for a specific camera model at the beginning and not an infobox for the company?
[[User:Cacolantern|Cacolantern]] 18:40, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

This article makes the statement that Minolta were the first to adopt open aperture TTL metering in an SLR. This is incorrect. Topcon launched the first commercial open aperture TTL camera, the Topcon RE in 1963.

== single lens rangefinder cameras? ==

Why no mention of the Minolta A, a breakthrough product in the U.S. market?[[User:Patrick0Moran|P0M]] ([[User talk:Patrick0Moran|talk]]) 03:53, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== non-digital Minolta assets ==

I've read references to the transfer of rights for non-digital photographic technology from Minolta to Seagull in China. From what I can gather this may have been limited to the manual-focus assets. Can anyone confirm this?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mwerneburg|Mwerneburg]] ([[User talk:Mwerneburg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mwerneburg|contribs]]) 18:10, 2 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Wrong logo? ==

It seems that the logo with 4 white bands is the Minolta logo and the logo with five white bands is the Konica Minolta logo. [[User:Faucheur|Faucheur]] ([[User talk:Faucheur|talk]]) 06:35, 8 May 2013 (UTC)
