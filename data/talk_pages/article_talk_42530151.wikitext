[[The Time (band)]] → {{no redirect|1=The Time}} — Over redirect. There is no need to disamiguate. There are already a hatnote at the top of the page anyway as well. [[User:Mhiji|Mhiji]] ([[User talk:Mhiji|talk]]) 01:10, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

* To most people The Time is the time is (1) the time for some coming important event, (2) what they look at their watches and clocks for, not some routine pop music band. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 07:02, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
**Therefore surely [[The Time]] should redirect to [[Time]]? [[User:Mhiji|Mhiji]] ([[User talk:Mhiji|talk]]) 15:52, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
***Or [[Time (disambiguation)]]? [[User:Mhiji|Mhiji]] ([[User talk:Mhiji|talk]]) 15:53, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
**** &quot;The Time&quot; used to be a disambiguation page: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Time&amp;oldid=120752536 [[Special:Contributions/76.66.203.138|76.66.203.138]] ([[User talk:76.66.203.138|talk]]) 08:09, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' [[The Time]] should redirect to [[Time (disambiguation)]] [[Special:Contributions/76.66.203.138|76.66.203.138]] ([[User talk:76.66.203.138|talk]]) 08:05, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

==Move back to [[The Time (band)]]==
The run as &quot;The Original 7ven&quot; is clearly over and the band is still best known as &quot;The Time&quot;.  Per [[WP:NAME]], this page should revert to [[The Time (band)]]. [[User:Rhindle The Red|Rhindle The Red]] ([[User talk:Rhindle The Red|talk]]) 13:28, 26 February 2015 (UTC)
