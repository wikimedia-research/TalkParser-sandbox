[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to [[Wikipedia]]. I have noticed that some of your recent [[genre]] changes, such as the one you made to [[:Stuck (album)]], have conflicted with our [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] and [[Wikipedia:verifiability|verifiability]] policies. While we invite all users to contribute constructively to Wikipedia, we urge all editors to provide [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] for edits made. When others disagree, we recommend you to seek [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for certain edits. Thank you. &amp;nbsp;-- [[Special:Contributions/WikHead|WikHead]] ([[User talk:WikHead|talk]]) 05:13, 4 September 2012 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from changing [[genre]]s, as you did to [[:Abrasive (album)]], without providing a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|source]] and without establishing a [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] on the article's talk page first. Genre changes to suit your own [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|point of view]] are considered [[Wikipedia:Disruptive Editing|disruptive]]. Thank you. &amp;nbsp;-- [[Special:Contributions/WikHead|WikHead]] ([[User talk:WikHead|talk]]) 05:17, 4 September 2012 (UTC)

[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please stop your [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]. If you continue to change [[genre]]s without discussion or sources, as you did at [[:Come Clean (Puddle of Mudd album)]], you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-genre3 --&gt; &amp;nbsp;-- [[Special:Contributions/WikHead|WikHead]] ([[User talk:WikHead|talk]]) 05:19, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
