Well, does anyone know if it worked? Has crime in the municipality decreased in the past year, for example?

Ugh. I live in [[Rupelmonde]], part of Kruibeke and even I think our mayor is slightly ridiculous when it comes to these matters. Other than that, no complaints, really, but I dislike all those banners saying (translated) &quot;Kruibeke, where nice people live.&quot; - DarknessThere
