==Notability of [[:Lucas Rooney]]==
[[Image:Information_icon.svg|left]]Hello, this is a message from [[User:Android Mouse Bot 2|an automated bot]]. A tag has been placed on [[:Lucas Rooney]], by {{#ifeq:1|1|[[User:Malpertuis|Malpertuis]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Malpertuis|talk]]&amp;nbsp;'''Â·''' [[Special:Contributions/Malpertuis|contribs]]),}} another Wikipedia user, requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. The tag claims that it should be speedily deleted because [[:Lucas Rooney]] seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To contest the tagging and request that administrators wait before possibly deleting [[:Lucas Rooney]], please affix the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{hangon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page, and put a note on its talk page. If the article has already been deleted, see the advice and instructions at [[WP:WMD]]. '''Please note that this bot is only informing you of the nomination for speedy deletion; it did not nominate [[:Lucas Rooney]] itself.''' Feel free to leave a message on the [[User talk:Android Mouse|bot operator's talk page]] if you have any questions about this or any problems with this bot. --[[User:Android Mouse Bot 2|Android Mouse Bot 2]] 00:26, 30 June 2007 (UTC)
