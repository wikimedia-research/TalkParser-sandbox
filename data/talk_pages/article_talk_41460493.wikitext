[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Materialscientist|Materialscientist]]. I wanted to let you know that I removed one or more external links you added, because they seemed to be inappropriate for an encyclopedia. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Materialscientist|my talk page]], or take a look at our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines]] about links. Thank you.
