While this is admittedly a very new club, and one that had a poor freshman year, I feel the team is likely to make a strong showing in several competitions this year, and likely in seasons to come.  They are currently leading their division [http://www.wpsl.info/standings/], making them early favorites for the league title, and are also one of only four clubs contesting this year's national championship ([[2013 National Women's Open]]).  They were slated to compete in a higher-level division of their league before the organization of that fell though, and have constantly sought top competition this year, holding a professional club to a one-goal game earlier in the season [http://www.bigsoccer.com/community/threads/nwsl-pre-in-season-friendlies-season-1.1982649/page-4].  They are fast on their way to earning a notable spot in the landscape of women's soccer in the US, so I don't think the page should be deleted - and if it is, I would hope that the process for reinstating it in the near future is made easy, because I feel they will be quite &quot;notable&quot; soon if they aren't already.  --[[User:CyMoahk|CyMoahk]] ([[User talk:CyMoahk|talk]]) 04:28, 10 June 2013 (UTC)
