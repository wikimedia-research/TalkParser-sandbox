I've made some changes to some of your edits to [[Margaret Durrell]] because they were too editorial or not encyclopedic. It would be very nice if you would publish photos and memories of your grandmother somewhere on the internet so that they could be used as references in the article. If you're willing to pass the photos into the public domain, you could publish them to Wikimedia Commons. It's unfortunate that you don't have an account so that I could email you these instructions, but please get in touch if you find this message, as I would very much like to assist you in your efforts to publish information about Margaret and her incredible family.
