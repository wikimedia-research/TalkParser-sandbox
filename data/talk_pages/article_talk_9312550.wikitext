Ironically, the bits about Cindy Eckman's contributions and them not meeting Wiki standards don't themselves meet Wiki standards. I don't see how an encyclopedia article can include its own history. 

And on the Atlanta/Officer Don version, I can't swear that it never came on at 5pm, but when I was watching it, it was definitely 4:30pm. And it doesn't seem like calling the ooey-gooey prizes, &quot;groceries&quot; hits the nail on the head. I mean, there were no bottles of windex or toilet paper or anything. It was all snack foods for kids, Gordon's Potato Chips, cartons of juice, stuff like that. [[User:72.145.148.59|72.145.148.59]] 19:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

I remember watching this as a kid, probably the second version with the New Zoo Review.  What I do remember vaguely was him singing something like &quot;Sailing, Sailing, Over The Nancy B?&quot;
