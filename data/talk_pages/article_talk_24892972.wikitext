==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:David Hughes (Legend)]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:David Hughes (Legend)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guideline for biographies]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:David Hughes (Legend)|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:David Hughes (Legend)|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you.&lt;!-- Template:Db-bio-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Ninetyone|ninety]]:[[User talk:Ninetyone|one]]  &lt;small&gt;(reply on my talk)&lt;/small&gt; 00:11, 30 October 2009 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:David Hughes (Legend)]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=322836966&amp;oldid=322832994 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] from Wikipedia.  The external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.  I removed the following link(s): http://file049a.bebo.com/12/large/2009/08/30/19/9624511299a11516923961l.jpg (matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bbebo\.com). If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[Wikipedia:Media|media]] file (e.g. an [[Wikipedia:Images|image]] file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's [[WP:COPYRIGHT|copyright policy]] and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our [[Wikipedia:Upload|upload]] facility to upload a suitable media file.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to undo the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks! --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 01:01, 30 October 2009 (UTC)
