[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:BethNaught|BethNaught]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/68.142.187.61|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinstrap_beard?diff=604191548 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Chinstrap beard]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:BethNaught|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:BethNaught|BethNaught]] ([[User talk:BethNaught|talk]]) 18:22, 14 April 2014 (UTC)
