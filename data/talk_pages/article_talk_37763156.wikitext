[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Lugia2453|Lugia2453]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/129.119.253.195|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Immanuel Kant]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Lugia2453|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Lugia2453|Lugia2453]] ([[User talk:Lugia2453|talk]]) 21:08, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
