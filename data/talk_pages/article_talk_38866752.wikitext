[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Danrok|Danrok]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:Mand (Kech District)]], but you didn't provide a [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. It's been removed for now, but if you'd like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] and re-add it, please do so! If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Danrok|my talk page]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; [[User:Danrok|Danrok]] ([[User talk:Danrok|talk]]) 08:05, 20 March 2013 (UTC)
