I just got warned because a changed something on this site, but the entire first paragraph is not needed. The guy is not 4'3 he does have a neck, I went ahead and deleted everything except the first sentence of the first paragraph, and the moderators changed it back, you may want to remove it, if i am not allowed.

Hi - all but the first sentence of the first paragraph is pure crap. &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.161.22.145|71.161.22.145]] ([[User talk:71.161.22.145|talk]]) 05:24, 24 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:I'm surprised there's even a discussion page for this - any observer can see that the page in its current form is simply defamation. Further, it's not relevant any more than a page about my pet cats would be. 18:22, 9 January 2008 (UTC) [[User:Aaeamdar|Aaeamdar]] ([[User talk:Aaeamdar|talk]])
