please, remove all the promo-singles from the singles list. there should be a separate list for them. [[User:Morealyz|Morealyz]] ([[User talk:Morealyz|talk]]) 08:12, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

I will re-arrange the singles when I next get the chance.  I have been attempting to update all the Lara Fabian articles as much as possible and I will do my best to try to format the singles in a more coherent way. [[User:Sg2002|Sg2002]] ([[User talk:Sg2002|talk]]) 22:14, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

Done![[User:Sg2002|Sg2002]] ([[User talk:Sg2002|talk]]) 22:41, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

great! thanks! but i still have doubts about early singles (for instance from LF'91). i could not find any info about them in other sources...[[User:Morealyz|Morealyz]] ([[User talk:Morealyz|talk]]) 08:50, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
