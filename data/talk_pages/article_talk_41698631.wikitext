==Edged's Discussions==
Hi! I've noticed you've been adding the tables to China Olympic article. Under Gymnastics, there is [[Yuri Ryazanov]] listed. Is this an error? Thx. [[User:Avani patel|Avani patel]] ([[User talk:Avani patel|talk]]) 01:04, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
:Uh yeah, just a copy-edit error, I'll get it, thanks. Should have been [[Zou Kai]]. [[User:Edged|Edged]] ([[User talk:Edged#top|talk]]) 01:06, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
::You made this same error at [[Japan at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]. Your help is appreciated, but please be more careful :) ☆ '''[[User_talk:CieloEstrellado|CieloEstrellado]]''' 20:01, 9 August 2008 (UTC)
Fantastic work with those tables mate. :) Made a few corrections to the Norway page, a few Bulgarian (or summat) cyclists had sneaked in and I prefer to use the names with diacritics. (An issue of big debate, personally can't see the problem with spelling people's names right.)

Any reason you didn't do athletics? :) [[User:Sam Vimes|Sam Vimes]] | [[User talk:Sam Vimes|Address me]] 05:09, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks a lot. I definitely made a pretty good number of copy-edit errors, even now I'll be going through and finding Russian boxers on the page for Kenya, and stuff like that. I had two reasons for not doing athletics (at least, right away, I might start it soon). First is the sheer time issue, it and swimming are so big I didn't think I'd get through all ~200 NOCs by today doing them for every country. The second is because I generally tried to combine the info from the NOC and on the individual pages with entry list information from the sport federations, and I haven't seen any entry lists from the IAAF or FINA, so it's tough. Especially for countries that have no information on the page yet, like [[Italy at the 2008 Summer Olympics]], which doesn't have a single athlete for athletics, and I have no idea where I'd even start.

== Results formats in judo ==
Dear Edged,
I suggest to follow the format displayed by articles related to [[Judo_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics]] in wikipedia W for Win, L for lost, xxxx (Ippon, Waza-ari, Yuko and Koka) for conviniency and ethetically reasons.
[[User:Whlee|Whlee]] ([[User talk:Whlee|talk]]) 13:56, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

:Alright, fine by me, I just wasn't sure what format to use, I should have thought to check that page. Not sure it was un-ethical (did you mean aesthetic?), but certainly good to be consistent :)  [[User:Edged|Edged]] ([[User talk:Edged#top|talk]]) 21:10, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

== Proposed format adjustment for bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton ==

With the [[2010 Winter Olympics|upcoming Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], I have an idea on the time showing for the [[Bobsleigh at the 2010 Winter Olympics|bobsleigh]], [[Luge at the 2010 Winter Olympics|luge]], and [[Skeleton at the 2010 Winter Olympics|skeleton]] events. You have the finish time shown for each of the events, but you will need to show the start times also. On all [[List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks|bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks]] like the [[Whistler Sliding Centre]], they show a start and track record for each event. What I recommend is to have the start time at the top part of the time in ''italics'' and the track time at the bottom part of the time in standard text. For each event I will put the start and track records prior to the Olympics. If a new record is set, the SR and/ or TR can be applied as such. Your thoughts? [[User:Miller17CU94|Chris]] ([[User talk:Miller17CU94|talk]]) 23:33, 29 October 2009 (UTC)

:Including the start times seems like a good idea to me (I'm assuming you mean on the results pages, though there's no reason not to make the same changes on the 'nation at the xxxx' pages as well).

:If I'm right, your suggestion would look like this, correct?

:My only problem with this is that it messes up the sort order of the columns. Maybe it would be better reversed?

::The top table would be better with an explnation of what the top and bottom times are for the average reader. [[User:Miller17CU94|Chris]] ([[User talk:Miller17CU94|talk]]) 02:53, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
:::Sorry it took me so long to respond to this. Personally, I prefer the bottom table. The main time that counts is the full run time, so I think it looks better to have it take precedence by being on top within each cell. Also, it keeps the sort order of the column right, though maybe there's another way around that that I'm not saavy enough to know.

== Getting Wikimedians to the Olympic Games ==

Hi. I am part of an effort to get Wikimedians access to the 2016 Summer Olympics as accredited reporters and photographers. Part of this effort includes covering the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]]. Two Wikimedians have credentials to attend these games as reporters through Wikimedia Australia. As English Wikipedia does not allow original reporting, this is largely through [[:n:Main Page|Wikinews]] with a project page found at [[:n:Wikinews:Paralympic Games|Wikinews:Paralympic Games]]. If you are interested in helping to get Wikimedians to the next Summer Olympics,I'd encourage you to assist with Wikinews efforts, and also to work on all language 2012 Summer Paralympic Wikipedia articles before, during and after the Games to demonstrate a track record of success. Thank you. --[[User:LauraHale|LauraHale]] ([[User talk:LauraHale|talk]]) 04:52, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

Please note that you're not allowed to call an article &quot;categorized&quot; if the category that you're adding does not exist on Wikipedia (i.e. is a redlink when you save the page). You need to either find a category that actually exists, or leave the &quot;uncategorized&quot; tag alone until somebody else finds and adds it — if an article is left in a redlinked category, that category has to be stripped.
