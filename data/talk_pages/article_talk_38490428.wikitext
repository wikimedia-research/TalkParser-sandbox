[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Widr|Widr]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/86.10.228.33|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Alfie Whattam]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Widr|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Widr|Widr]] ([[User talk:Widr|talk]]) 21:08, 11 February 2013 (UTC)
