Thanks for your help on [[modern geocentrism]]. :-) [[User:Evercat|Evercat]] 13:50, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)


Thanks for the honest perspective. I cannot make you (or any one else) &quot;believe&quot; in geo-centrism, but it clearly is as feasible as heliocentrism, discounting the notion of natural simplicity (i.e., God would likely have to have willed it for it to turn out this way). Does understanding that fact make you wonder sometimes? Truth_Seeker.

==[[Nuclear fusion]] vs. [[Nucleosynthesis]]== 

I call the fusing of nuclei heavier than iron [[nucleosynthesis]]. I use nuclear fusion to describe the creation of a heavier nucleus from lighter nuclei in a process that releases energy. But I see that the article is not written from that point of view; which is why I didn't re-edit. Off topic, but you seemed to be very contentious and appeared to be trying to condescend; unnecessary.

== Langmuir ==

I saw that you were basically the only one to edit the [[Langmuir probe]] page. I was wondering if you had any knowledge in Langmuir himself. I am currently working on reworking his page (my grandmother was his secretary and i have some of his journals and notes in my possession). 01:33, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Sorry, I don't think I can help. I believe that there is considerable biographical information in &quot;The Complete Works of ... &quot;, but you must know that already. I am a plasma physicist specialized in Langmuir probes, so if there are entries in the journals and notes that you would like me to analyze or comment on from the technical side, I would be eager to do that. I live in Muinch but make occasional trips to the States. Where are you located? [[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 20:32, 2005 Feb 9 (UTC)

::The above message was left by [[User:578|bakuzjw]] [[User_talk:578|(aka 578)]] 20:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
I am currently rewriting the article and i just wondered if you would like to help, (I am rewriting the article in word and either tonight or tomorrow night i will upload it to wikipedia), i was wondering if you would be willing to look through it for spelling or grammar errors after i upload to wikipedia thanks. I live in Gainesville Florida, but i was born in Munich Germany so its a small world eh, (my german is rather bad i can speak it but wirting it is a whole differnt story) [[User:578|bakuzjw]] [[User_talk:578|(aka 578)]] 20:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I think Wikipedia could use a page on emmisive probes.  I found the page on Langmuir probes very helpful.  I don't know if you have the knowledge to start such an article, but perhaps you might know someone who could.  Just an idea.

:I added a paragraph on emissive probes to the Langmuir probe article. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 12:19, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

I just came upon the Langmuir Probe page yesterday. I would like to refer you to the overview article written by Larry Brace in &quot;Measurement techniques in space plasmas: particles&quot;
 By Robert F. Pfaff, Joseph E. Borovsky 
&lt;http://books.google.com/books?id=3pBNNEykLIIC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&gt; 
which speaks to spaceflight LP's that he was involved with from 1959 (IGY) through Pioneer Venus (1978-1992) and Dynamics Explorer 2 (ca. 1980). The paper includes an extensive bibliography. Unfortunately, Larry is no longer with us to answer followup questions. 

I was flight electronics designer for the PV and DE-2 and would like to question the line at the end of the Single Probe section stating that the need for &quot;sophisticated electronics...&quot; is a driver to go to multiple probes. Larry used two probes at right angles on PV, but they were used as two independent single probes. The Instrument had several pre-programmed operating modes that could independently be applied to each of the probes. Either of the Krehbiel, et. al., articles in the bibliography will give details on the Instrument system design.

==Homeopathy==
A fair &quot;compromise&quot;; but I fear that it will probably be declared too wordy by the homeopathy apologists and watered down/removed. [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 20:09, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I do not appreciate your reversals of the Totally Disputed tag.  I have detailed precisely what points are factually incorrect and misleading, and I think readers need to be made aware that your version of the truth is disputed.  --[[User:Leifern|Leifern]] 15:16, May 24, 2005 (UTC)

:Looking through [Talk:Homeopathy]], the only specific objections I can find from you are POV disputes. Will you please do me the favor of writing a bulleted list of the statements you feel are ''factually'' inaccurate? [[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 15:27, 2005 May 24 (UTC)

Off the top of my head:
*That homeopathy is best known for its use of chemically inactive ingredients
*That Hahnemann's texts are the final word on homeopathy
*That homeopaths explain potency of extremely diluted remedies as a &quot;vital force&quot;
*That there is a scientific establishment that rejects the &quot;theoretical foundations&quot; for homeopathy
*That the guy on quackwatch has any credibility
*etc...
I realize you and Geni have decided your grasp on science exceeds that of anybody who disagrees with you, but I have caught a) Geni making so many wrong assertions about statistics, rhetorical fallacies, and clinical trials that he has lost all credibility, and b) being polemic about the topic, that it's clear that this article is worthless for anyone who is interested in learning about the topic (as opposed to being indoctrinated on one perspective).  --[[User:Leifern|Leifern]] 15:50, May 24, 2005 (UTC)

==Infobox==

The infobox removed had two versions - one added manually into the article, and the other, containing the same information and formatting, that could be added through use of a template. The template version was deleted, which means that manual versions of it are bad for comparable reasons (In this case, because of a consensus that it was not really an infobox at all). In this case, if you wanted to preserve the information, I'd suggest categories, or simply adding the relevent facts into the text of the article. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 13:48, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)

:[[Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/Deleted]] at the bottom. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 16:03, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)

To see the infobox on [[Acupuncture]] and [[Homeopathy]] simply click on their repective history hyperlink.  Then look for my name and click on the time and date stamp to the left of my name and you will see an old version of the respective articles complete with the very useful infobox that Snowspinner keeps on deleting. -- [[User:John Gohde|John Gohde]] 13:21, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==[[Nuclear fusion]] exceptions?==

« With some exceptions, nuclei lighter than [[iron]] release energy when they fuse, while heavier nuclei absorb energy [...] ».  What exceptions had you in mind?  I can't think of any.

[[User:Urhixidur|Urhixidur]] 19:19, 2005 Apr 22 (UTC)

There exist certain metastable nuclei, at the very least, which fuse and also release a ton of alphas. I don't know any specific one, but that might be how to find one. [[User:Danielfong|Danielfong]] 08:59, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[Fusor]] tubes ==

I'm trying to gather information to update the fusor article (see [[Talk:Farnsworth-Hirsch_Fusor#updates]]), and found [http://web.archive.org/web/20010602040847/http://www.ipp.mpg.de/~Arthur.Carlson/rider.html this article].  Unless there's a large secret underground organization of PhD physicists named Art Carlson, I'm going to assume it was written by you.  Do you have a link to a current version?  I just get dead links everywhere else.  Or perhaps you changed your mind and took it down? 
Regardless, I bet you could help expand on the article... - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:53, May 2, 2005 (UTC)

:That's me, all right. And I still stand by what I wrote. It's just that I've left the business and neither I nor anybody else is maintaining the pages. The original thesis is now available online, which is a much better reference anyway: http://theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/0018.mit.theses/1995-130

:I'll try to take a look at the fusor article in the next few days. I hope I'll be able to say something intelligent on the subject. If you have any specific questions before then, shoot. [[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 16:47, 2005 May 3 (UTC)

Can I have your vote on whether to move the page to [[Fusor]]?  [[Talk:Farnsworth-Hirsch_Fusor#Rename_to_plain_old_.22Fusor.22_or_.22Fusor_tube.22.3F]] - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 23:41, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

== Faraday disc ==
Hi Art. Thanks for merging the [[Faraday disc]] and [[homopolar generator]] articles: you did a good job. I found the disc to be a fascinating subject. When I started the article I thought I was writing about a simple dynamo, but then I realised that I had to learn about the [[Lorentz force]], and to understand that I had to read about [[special relativity]]. I'm hoping that providing an easy-to-read explanation in Wikipedia will help combat the unnecessary mysticism that surrounds this device. Regards, --[[User:Heron|Heron]] 29 June 2005 09:24 (UTC)

:Happy to help. Actually I'm not satisfied with the explanations on the page. I can't believe it makes a difference that charge comes in discrete bundles (electrons). But I need to mull it over before I can say any more. [[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 2005 June 29 09:30 (UTC)

Hi again, Art.  [[User:Occultations]] has just queried your addition of the &quot;Configuration without a return path&quot; section to the [[Faraday Paradox]] article, and I have to say I agree with him, although I'm an engineer and not a physicist.  Could you give a reference to back up your information, please?  (And it would be nice to know whether anybody has verified it experimentally.) You seem to be saying that either (1) the field is not uniform, so its rotation can have an effect on the disc, or (2) somehow the disc knows that the source of the field is rotating, even though the field itself is uniform.  Which of these statements is true, or are they both wrong?  --[[User:Heron|Heron]] 22:45, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Aether - thanks ==

Thanks for sorting out aether. You might perhaps be interested in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience]] and [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention/Physics]]. [[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 08:32:13, 2005-07-13 (UTC).

==[[User:Reddi]] RfC==

Could you ask [[User:Reddi]] to respond on the [[Talk:Plasma cosmology]] page? He seems to have decided I'm not worth discussing.

If this fails, would you support an RfC against [[User:Reddi]]? He responded on [[User Talk:Reddi|his talk page]] that he will not respond to my comments because he considers me a troll. 

Thanks, --[[User:Joshuaschroeder|Joshuaschroeder]] 20:56, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:See [[User_talk:Reddi]]. We passed each other in an edit conflict. If he persists in reverting without entering the discussion, then an RfC would certainly be called for. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 21:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

Now he's at it on the [[Quasi-steady state cosmology]] page. I'm going to start the RfC.

--[[User:Joshuaschroeder|Joshuaschroeder]] 21:42, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

I've started the RfC here: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Reddi]]. [[User:Joshuaschroeder|Joshuaschroeder]] 22:17, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[User:Elerner|Elerner]] RfC ==

I have added a request for comment on Eric Lerner's editing, at [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Elerner]]. Please take a look at it and endorse if you feel it is appropriate. &amp;ndash;[[User:Joke137|Joke137]] 00:23, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

Art, If you would, please take a moment to comment on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Pseudoscience/Proposed_decision, since you have experience discussing aneutronic fusion with Lerner. Thanks. [[User:ABlake|ABlake]] 21:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

== Cold fusion ==

Hi Art, sorry for bothering you, but I wonder if you could help with a problem. The foxes appear to be guarding the henhouse in the [[cold fusion]] article. Could you have a look at the talk page, and also [[Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/Cold fusion]]? Much obliged. &amp;ndash;[[User:Joke137|Joke]] 19:26, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

There's currently a controversy at [[Cold fusion]] that I would appreciate it if you could look at.  The article is about to fail a Featrued Article Removal Candidate [[vote]].  There are at least 3 fairly different versions in play: one based on the original Featured Article dating back to 2004-08-20 and tossing out all edits between now and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33905552] (&quot;FA version&quot;), one which was the current version up until that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33645188] (&quot;current version&quot;), and a proposed new draft written originally by Edmund Storms (a retired Los Alamos scientist) and edited by me [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion/tmp&amp;oldid=33876153] (&quot;Storms version&quot;).  At the moment the article is being rather agressively edited by a few people who support the version from a year ago, and if this stands, a lot of good material will be lost.  Frankly, I can't entirely support any of the versions; the article just needs more work and more different perspectives.  Hence this invitation.  I hope you can help.

I'm posting this to you because I've seen you on various physics-related pages, and/or because you've worked on the [[Cold fusion]] page before.  Thank you for your time.

[[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 06:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)



:Dear Joke, dear ObsidianOrder (hope you're both listening),

:I looked through the three versions of the cold fusion article. I have criticims, but none are as bad as I feared. The problems can probably all be cleaned up. Examples of phasing that I consider POV:
::From 33645188 - current version:
:::The autoradiograph shown here is a good example of what the skeptics demand: conclusive evidence other than excess heat. Only a nuclear reaction could produce the copious x-rays shown here.
:::We know that cold fusion is a nuclear effect because …
:::It is more likely that the current understand of physics is incomplete, because highly loaded metal deuterides have not been studied in detail before.
::From 33876153 - Storms version:
:::On the other hand, reactions initiated by the &quot;cold fusion&quot; process occur in a unique solid structure without significant energy being applied.
:::This is not the result of biased, true believers continuing to be deceived, but of trained scientists who trusted what they saw with their instruments after much skeptical evaluation. This approach is identical to how all new discoveries are treated by science.
:::Most disagreement over the validity of the results, that continue to the present day, ignores the fact that all of the demands by skeptics have been met.
:::At this time, it is safe to conclude that anomalous energy is produced regardless of its source.
:::Clearly, unusual nuclear processes are occurring in material where none should occur.
:Although the order of my preference is FA, current, Storms, I don't see the problems as so massive that I need to cast a vote. If I had the time - which I unfortunately don't - I would enter the fray and comment and edit in more detail. I'll try to drop by from time to time anyway. Good luck. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 16:55, 6 January 2006 (UTC)


==Ball Lightning==

Be assured the pdf exits on the web on a Royal Society server. I downloaded it round about 2000 GMT. It is itself a review, so summarising a conclusion in one sentence would be 'Singer did review'!.If it's characterisable as POV, then we are all doomed!  Please track down and read so we can reach an agreed position.

:I didn't find it with google, but I downloaded it from your link. I'll try to read it soon. It seems to me (before I have actaully read the article) that it is inappropriate to single out one article in the intro. More an editorial issue than one of content (I hope). --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 21:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

I found it quite high up Google earlier- but it seems to not be in pole position now (odd, but not unknown).
Tend to agree it probably shouldn't be in Intro. But its general style seemed appropriate to what finally goes there. Bob aka [[User:Linuxlad|Linuxlad]]

== Marmet's physics ==

Hi I gave a little more precision on the [[Tired light]] Talk page. Is his mechanism clear now? I would be interested to discuss a little more about it if you like, although it won't be fast as I don't have much time. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 08:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Are You a drowser==

Hey, Art, are you not a big name in the world of drowsing? I think I remember seeing your name in some drowsing literature I picked up from the library. I don't mean to accuse you of being POV. I just thought it would be cool to be arguing with someone of your status. [[User:JohnJohn|JohnJohn]] 02:52, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

: I do a lot of drowsing myself, in the evenings, with a nice cup of cocoa. I don't much rate dowsing though. [[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 11:29, 12 February 2006 (UTC).

:Nope. Ain't none of me. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 15:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

I have a friend who works for the LaGrange water department. One day I saw him working by the road and stopped to talk. I was astonished to see him walking around with a dowsing rod. What are you doing? I asked him. &quot;Looking for the pipe&quot; he replied matter of factly. &quot;But don't you have electronics to do that?&quot;  &quot;Sure, but this works just as good. Finds plastic too.&quot; he said. That's when my friends helper chimed in &quot;I have a friend who doesn't believe it.&quot; [[User:Tommysun|Tommysun]] 19:27, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

==Mediation==
So, I have dutifully taken the mediation of [[Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Plasma cosmology|plasma cosmology]]. Before we start, I would like to know what form of mediation you would like to take? You guys basically have three options: the first (and most popular) is to just do it on the wiki, probably at [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Plasma cosmology]]. The second is to do it by email (I wouldn't recommend it as there are quite a few users listed). And the third is to do it be [[IRC]]. Please respond at [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Plasma cosmology]] where you would like to do it. Thanks.

:Okay, now that we have all agreed to do it on the Wiki, I have intiated the next step which is an intial statement to see where we all stand. Just state your point of view on the issues at hand without making references to others or the conduct of them. Just to let you know, I have been reading over the talk page and will address the concern of needing a person who understands plasma comology. I feel after reading it, I have a pretty good grasp of it as I am pretty good in science. However, the issues seem to extend beyond just simple right and wrong on the issue but rather into what should be included and where we should draw the line. I hope, as mediator, to rectify these differences and to reach a consensus. As a last note, I suggest you put the mediation page on your watchlist as I will not always give messages like this.

==A plasma question==
Sorry to bother you, but I was impressed with your command of plasma physics on the [[plasma]] talk page, and I was wondering if you could answer a question for me. In a one atmosphere uniform glow Discharge plasma (OAUGDP) what is the voltage drop for a large current, say 1000 amps, running across it? Is there an equation that one could use to compute this for different voltages? Thanks a lot for your patience. cc[[User:24.137.78.34|24.137.78.34]] 00:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

:That's not the parameter range where I have direct experience, but .... The voltage drop at 1000 A will depend both on the area involved and the distance between the electrodes. Unless you have a very large area, when you try to put 1000 A through a gas, you will generally get an [[electric arc]] rather than a [[glow discharge]]. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 15:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

==Fundamental Limitations to Non-Maxwellian Fusion Reactor Concepts==

Hi Art. First, I'd like to say that I really respect what you've done so far. It's very impressive (especially your help in the fusion FAQ and the glossary), and your pages have lead me onto an entirely different path of inquiry.

I have a question and concern regarding your repeated citation of Rider's thesis and paper, however. Unfortunately, I can't access the thesis (the links that I could find were all down), nor could I read your review of the paper. Perhaps you still have some copies. In any case, certain statements seemed spurious, and they appeared to be highlighted in the [http://fusion.ps.uci.edu/artan/Posters/aps_poster_2.pdf following] poster at the APS meeting. I haven't looked at Rider's calculation directly, but the poster notices that Rider assumes that the velocity space is always isotropic, and then proves that the redistribution power required for at least one example is smaller than the ideal fusion power. I see that you cite many of Rider's original paper's without taking this vulnerablity into account. Could you look into this? Is the jury still out on this issue? Articles referencing fundamental limitations and claiming 'impossibility' should really at -least- mention that there is some controversy. From my, admittedly green, standpoint, it looks like there really is a problem with some of the impossibility claims. We should look into this quickly, and revert if necessary. Kindly, [[User:Danielfong|Danielfong]] 09:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

:Backatcha, Daniel. You've left your mark for me all over Wikipedia. I'll try to speak to the content where it comes up. Here, I'd first like to welcome you to Wiki's fusion pages. I have the impression you will be able to contribute a lot. Second, I'd like you to remember me to Sam Cohen. I spent a few weeks with him at Princeton longer ago than either of us would like to be reminded of. At the time I was just starting to consider leaving fusion - or at least the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik|IPP]] in [[Garching bei München|Garching]]. After a long story that is best told with the help of a bottle of red wine, I am currently back in Garching but at a different Max Planck Institute working on grid computing for the German astronomy community. On your [[User:Danielfong|list of likes and dislikes]] I notice you did not include dancing on roller skates one way of the other. (Ask Sam.)

:Thanks for pointing out the poster. I had been wondering what Rostoker and friends had been up to since our [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5375/307a encounter] eight years ago. I'll need some time to look at their argument in detail. I am ''very'' surprized that they think they can get around the problem by considering a non-isotopic distribution. Generally speaking, the time scale to reach isotropy is ''much'' faster than that to reach a Maxwellian energy distribution, so I would expect the recirculating power required to be even worse. I admit that &quot;impossibility&quot; can never be absolute. A German professor came up with a system several years ago to which Rider's argument did not obviously apply. For whatever reason, he has sunk back into oblivion. I don't say there is no way around Rider's arguments (except when I get polemic), but I do insist that anyone claiming that a proton-boron system is feasible has to specifically address them.

:--[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 12:21, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

::It's a specific type of non-maxwellian distribution they're talking about -- a 'drifted' maxwellian. I think these relax much more slowly. [[User:Danielfong|Danielfong]] 21:31, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

I may (from a purely theoretical viewpoint) agree that my addition [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_geocentrism&amp;diff=47252596&amp;oldid=45835716] did not add &quot;content&quot;, in exactly the same sense that any mathematical theorem does not add content, although it may be surprising or revealing. But what makes you call it POV?

:The red flags were expressions like &quot;extremely complicated&quot;, &quot;extremely unsatisfactory&quot;, and &quot;awkward&quot;. I also find the comparison to [[epicycle]]s to be inapt and designed to ridicule geocentrism more than to objectively characterize or criticize it. The big problem with epicycles was not that they were inherently more complicated than Keplerian orbits, but that they did not fit the data without an indefinite number of additional parameters. Furthermore, we don't have to &quot;devise a geocentric reformulation of the laws of physics&quot;. Einstein has already done that for us. In general relativity, the symmetries are broken not by the laws of physics, but by the distribution of matter. I also find the example of a perfectly spherical Earth to be artificial.

Further, the Sun is not the center of the universe; it is merely the center of one local solar system, and itself orbits around the center of our galaxy.

==Eric Lerner's Focus Fusion==

Hi Art, you seem to be (one of) the resident experts on fusion, can I ask your opinion of Eric Lerner's attempts to get proton-boron fusion to produce net energy? From what I have read on your talk page, it seems that you agree with Tod Rider's thesis that dismisses p-11B as a viable fuel mix for a future fusion power reactor. Would I be correct in assuming that in your opinion Lerner has not addressed Rider's criticisms either in whole or in part?  --[[User:Jaganath]] 13:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:He seems to have addressed the issue at least in part. The Bremsstrahlung argument depends on a chain of energy transfer from the fusion products to the fuel ions, from there to the electrons, and finally loss by the electrons through Bremsstrahlung. For the sake of argument, perfectly optimistic assumptions are made for the first and last steps. Lerner cuts the chain at the second step by proposing a reduction in the classical energy transfer rate from ions to electrons. I haven't read his paper yet, so I can't say whether his theory and the experimental evidence for it is any good. I also suspect, but can't at present show, that achieving the necessary conditions will have its own set of fundamental problems. I'll report back after I have read [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0401126 his paper]. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson] 09:54, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:After reading Lerner's paper, I've made some changes to [[Aneutronic fusion]]. There are many interesting points in the paper, but also several that I find suspect. If we accept his calculation, the effect is only a factor of 2. This is enough to change the ratio of bremsstrahlung to fusion power from just over one to just under one. But since the calculation of the ratio is based on very simple and optimistic assumptions, there is still no way in hell to make a reactor work. I think the most serious problem in this particular case is the neglect of [[cyclotron radiation]]. This loss mechanism is hard to get exactly right, but since it scales with B^2, it's going to be a mother at a megatesla. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 09:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

::I got this one wrong the first time around, as documented in [[Talk:Aneutronic fusion#Cyclotron radiation, radiation dose, and suppression of bremsstrahlung]]. Cyclotron radiation ''could'' be a problem, but it's not the killer I thought it would be because, if the plasma beta is high enough, the frequency will be below the cut-off and not propagate. Then I realized that these kinds of fields will have so much magnetic pressure that they cannot be contained. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 08:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

:::Eric Lerner and I have had a lot of additional discussions. We still disagree on whether the lifetime of a high-field plasmoid will be limited to something close to the Alfven transit time, but either way, in this case there may not be the kind of all-encompassing proof of non-principle that I love.

Thanks Art for replying so quickly and taking the time to craft a comprehensible and detailed reply. Seems like p-11B fusion still faces huge, if not insurmountable problems before it can become a future energy source; in light of this, can I ask if you think [[ITER]], and (spherical) tokamaks in general are the right direction to be going in if we are to harness fusion to produce useful power within your or my lifetimes? --[[User: Jaganath]] 18:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

:For what it's worth, I believe (1) fusion will work with D-T or not at all, (2) the best bet is an ITER-like tokamak, although similar machines like the stellarator or the spherical tokamak might turn out to be a bit better, (3) despite formidable problems, there is no fundamental reason that fusion cannot become an attractive source of energy, and (4) we will probably never get there, because trying things out is so expensive and time-consuming, and because there are alternatives that are constantly improving.

I'm no scientist, nor do I exactly know the details of what IP 68 added. However a quick Google search did show that this concept might deserve its own page.

Secondly, if you are in a position to improve on the article content, please do so. Calling a good faith edit &quot;worse than useless&quot; isn't right. Allow me to remind you that the majority of WP's content is written by anon IPs, their inaccuracies and irrelevant material can be improved upon, but shouldn't be removed outright. 

By your contributions, I see you are an expert in this field, please don't take this as criticism, it isn't.

:Thanks for your interest. I already said on the Talk page that an article, even a stubby one, might be a good idea, but the current REDIRECT already leads the reader to the essential information. I didn't mean to impute the good faith of 62. I maybe should have chosen softer words. But the content really is bad: &quot;Quasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits.&quot; Quasineutrality has nothing to do with currents, only with charge densities. The only precise meaning I can assign to currents that close on themselves is that the divergence of the current vanishes, which is required in any steady state, whether it is quasineutral or not. The emphasis on certain concepts like Birkeland currents and double-layers is also a particular point of view (see [[Plasma cosmology]]) that is not widely held and thus, even where it is not wrong, not the best choice for an encyclopedic article. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 14:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

Dear Art, your criterion for notability and Wiki-entries seemed to me very dubious, however I respect your view on the problem.

Well, this is all based on my old readings done several years ago [when I was not Wikipedian], when I have not even met prof. Qureshi personally. The fact that I have met him in Wikipedia changes nothing, I have opened the entry solely on scientific grounds. You can check the bibliographic list of his publications in the main article.

: Concerning the NAFL author - definition of complementarity [http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0504115 page 6] - ''&quot;The particle and wave nature of the photon cannot be simultaneously demonstrated to hold ...&quot;'' and then the author says ''&quot;Note carefully the location of the word &quot;simultaneously&quot; in this definition; if we were to change BCP to &quot;. . . cannot be demonstrated to hold simultaneously...&quot; then such a definition would arguably fail even in NAFL.&quot;''. COMMENT by me - I see NO DIFFERENCE in the meaning even IF the word order is changed. I don't think that my English is so poor to fail to recognize a change of the sense due to word order. As this author is obviously with English language problem, I am not sure why it is included on equal footing with Qureshi, and Unruh. Not to mention that he works for commercial IBM corporation and possibly is not involved in academic research seriously, i.e. looks like hobby-scientist. I judge this on the content of his paper, and the discussed passage, NOT on extra-scientific criteria.

:: Dear Art, as the passion has calmed down, yes '''I am happy that Unruh personally posted in Wikipedia'''! (I never expected such a fast solution). Now concerning your comment - Qureshi is completely right, but my work compared to Qureshi's work is more general because I have provided EXPLANATION WHY the information is erased. Yes, in 2004 I said exactly as Qureshi that overlap erases the which way, and physicists didnot believe a word, as I had no math proof. Well, I suspect you did not understand the introduction which is '''compressed information''' and one must &quot;decompress&quot; it only by having some acquaintance with decoherence theory of Zeh. But I believe you understand perfectly well the equations [3] and [4] in my paper as they apply only Beam-splitter transformations and mirror reflection.
So let us calculate the evolution of the quantum state in Unruh's setup directly [look my figure 2]:
: &lt;math&gt;\Psi \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\imath |1&gt; + |2&gt;) \rightarrow  -1 |6&gt; \rightarrow  -1 \imath |8&gt; \rightarrow  \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} (|D_1&gt; +  \imath |D_2&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;
:: as &lt;math&gt;|8&gt; = \frac{1}{2} (|1&gt; + |2&gt;)&lt;/math&gt; you see that &lt;math&gt;|D_2&gt; = \frac{1}{2} (|1&gt;+|2&gt;)&lt;/math&gt; that is &lt;math&gt;|D_2&gt; = |8&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. It is obvious as &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt; gets half the intensity of light coming at |8&gt; that is &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt; gets light from both paths |1&gt; and |2&gt;. The '''present momentum''' of photons coming along path 8, with '''past history''' of either path 1 or path 2, is the SAME. The beam-splitter (BS3) reflects the present momentum, and not according to &quot;knowledge&quot; about what the photon momentum WERE IN THE PAST. [[User:Danko Georgiev MD|Danko Georgiev MD]] 06:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

p.s. contrary to Unruh, I have said that putting the obstacle or NOT does not matter. It is the presence of destructive interference at path 5 itself that &quot;erases&quot; the which way. Look at the expression &lt;math&gt;\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt; + 0 |5&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. You can drop the zero term [comment: multiplied by zero vector |5&gt; cannot be regained without dividing to zero! - impossible math operation]. Indeed the existent negative interference mathematically is formulated like that: &lt;math&gt;\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. The measurement of the negative interference by obstacle physically mathematically is written like that &lt;math&gt;\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. So my conclusion is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to have difference in the which way claim for interference + obstacle vs. interference + no obstacle. The mathematical expression is always the SAME &lt;math&gt;\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. ''I am excited'' because it seems Unruh will publish his original 1 page letter-to-editor in PP (full of errors), and as his letter explicitly claims the inconsistency decribed in my sec. 3.3, I will have the beautiful opportunity to publicly solve the Georgiev-Unruh issue in the pages of reputable peer-review journal. [[User:Danko Georgiev MD|Danko Georgiev MD]] 09:08, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

:Dear Danko, one thing still has me puzzled. When you and Qureshi talk about the interference &quot;erasing&quot; the which-way information, I have this picture:
::''Two laser pulses approach each other.''
::''Before they cross, a measurement will yield which-way information.''
::''As they cross, there is an interference pattern.''
::''After they have crossed, there is no longer any which-way information.''
:Is that what Queshi and you are trying to say?
:And a related question. Kastner seems to believe there is never any which-way information when both slits are open, whether or not the interference pattern is measured, and whether one talks about the situation just after the slits or just before the detector. I believe you disagree. What do you see as the flaw in her argument?
:--[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 10:42, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
::: Dear Art, yes before the overlap there is which way, but after the overlap there is no which way. The critical is the idea of [[bijection]] of input state and observables. As one can take the realist interpretation of q-superposition, which in my case is direct ontological interpretation of the AND-gate, one will notice two types of superposition - one of orthogonal states, and one of non-orthogonal states. The states before the overlap [imagine |1&gt; and |2&gt; of Mach-Zehnder] are really orthogonal, so measuring the state at |1&gt; simply gives you information that the state is NOT |2&gt;. This state &lt;math&gt;\Psi = \imath |1&gt; + |2&gt;&lt;/math&gt; (not normalized) is superposition in TIME, but in space the wavefunctions |1&gt; and |2&gt; are separated - do not overlap - hence they are orthogonal states - interference is zero. Now consider after overlap the state at the arm |6&gt;. Here you have superposition of non-orthogonal states. States |1&gt; and |2&gt; are vectors that are time dependent. Under time evolution, both wavefunctions overlap, so they are no more orthogonal. Detecting at |6&gt; a photon does not give you information that the photon has passed through only path 1, or alternatively only path 2. You know indeed that the photon passed both paths, interfered and came to arm 6. So in certain sense my work shows another &quot;inconsistency&quot; of the popular presentation of QM, and in OLD Copenhagen anti-realist view. As I use direct math argumentation I show that quantum waves pass through both paths at ones. And this is NOT equivalent to &quot;lack of knowledge of the photon path&quot;. Yes, I have knowledge which is quite substantial - &quot;I know that the photon passed both paths at once&quot;. The proof is suggested in the introduction of my PP paper. Imagine a double slit - close slit 1 - see Gaussian like distribution1 , close slit 2 - see Gauusian like distribution 2. What knowledge you have? You know that slit 1 XOR slit 2 is open, which means the slits are NOT simultaneously open. Now open both slits - you see nice interference pattern. What you know? Is it &quot;lask of knowledge of slit 1 or slit 2&quot;? NO! You know mathematically rigorously that the setup is NOT XOR. Simple logical gate application of NOT-gate to XOR-gate gives you the XNOR gate. After elimination the &quot;false&quot; &quot;false&quot; outcome which is mathematically trivial, but physically meaningless, then you come to the AND gate. Yes, in coherent double-slit setup with open both slits the photon passed through BOTH slits at once! This is the ONLY mathematically valid way to get the interference. Concerning Kastner, as I said she is in my view incompetent on the topic, so I neither understand her analogy, nor I think she understands the orthogonality of vectors criterion, nor she understands what strictly [[bijection]] means in math terms. Sorry, for my mathematically oritented thinking. I love mathematics, and as Drezet joked on Afshar's talk &quot;Mathematics is the queen of all natural science ... and Danko is its prophet&quot; [the meaning was similar]. [[User:Danko Georgiev MD|Danko Georgiev MD]] 11:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
:: Addendum: as you may see in my paper I say I have defended the MWI of QM. Yes, I mention the Copenhagen interpretation - CI - purely formally, where I envison CI anti-realism based directly on QM formalism. Yet, I think that popular wording of CI as &quot;lack of which way&quot; as MISLEADING and semantically wrong. &quot;You don't know whether photon passed through slit 1 or slit 2&quot; for me is equivalent to &quot;you don't know the density matrix of setup&quot; i.e. you don't know whether two slit wavefunctions 1 and 2 are coherent or they are incoherent. In contrast knowing that the two wavefunctions are coherent, is NOT lack of knowledge, but substantial information. You know the photon has passed both slits at once. In a certain sense you also know the which way bijection is NOT valid, but also the knowledge - &quot;ww bijection is false&quot; - for me is NOT &quot;lack of knowledge of the bijection truth-value&quot;. i.e. lack of knowledge suggests it might be true, which is not the case [[User:Danko Georgiev MD|Danko Georgiev MD]] 11:32, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

It seems you have pounced ;).  I'm suspicious of your use of the words &quot;might&quot; and &quot;verifiable content&quot; together here.  I'm not convinced that running the current through the edges of the polyhedron would be the best bet; won't the magnetic field curve at the vertices leaving them unshielded, and a source of electron losses?  I can't find anything in the [http://askmar.com/ConferenceNotes/Should%20Google%20Go%20Nuclear.pdf Google transcript].  I subconsciously corrected Bussard's truncated cube and truncated dodecahedron into cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron, respectively, when I tried to work out all the shapes.  I suppose if he says &quot;truncated cube&quot; when he means &quot;cuboctahedron with solenoids on the square faces,&quot; then when he says &quot;truncated dodecahedron&quot; he means &quot;icosidodecahedron with solenoids on the pentagonal faces.&quot;  When does filling in the gaps turn into original research?  Let's discuss. [[User:Eassin|Eassin]] 16:01, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

:I was thinking of the picture and section named &quot;NPG Polyhedral Grid&quot; on page 14 of the google transcript. You're right that the field would go to zero at the vertices, but it does that anyway. Where two of the round coils touch, their currents are oppositely directed, so there is no field to protect them there. Funny that Bussard didn't mention that. But there I go doing OR again. It's a constant danger in a topic like this, but I'm afraid the only alternative might be to delete the article due to a lack of secondary sources and critical appraisal in the literature. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 20:57, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

Mea culpa; I should have read instead of using the search function.  Bussard does skirt the fact that where the round coils touch the field goes to zero: his models show a progressive decrease in amount of metal sitting in the field lines.  I think it has something to do with the fact that quadrupole magnets can only focus in one direction and you should design your vertex based on that.  I guess my question is: why do you think the NPG polyhedral grid might be the best way to go, and why didn't Bussard stick with it?  
*Was it because a single coil of tubing wasn't producing a strong enough field, or is a circle always a better solenoid than a polygon?
*Further, it looks like his NPG polyhedral grid is soldered together.  I remember doing a homework problem quite like that; some of those edges will have zero current.  Was the NPG polyhedral grid poor because there is an inherent flaw, or because he forgot to use insulators at each vertex to ensure that the current went in the same loop as the coolant?
*And finally, why is it a rectified cube instead of - for instance - a rectified rhombic enneacontahedron?  Why did he add more turns to the coil instead of adding more single turn faces, which would have been easier to build? 
I don't believe for a minute that Bussard is going to save the world; I'm just curious about some basic E&amp;M if you have the time for original research, verging on speculation and outright mind-reading.  If not, I've been meaning to read Jackson for many years now anyway.  Thanks. [[User:Eassin|Eassin]] 05:17, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:I suspect, and seem to agree with Bussard on this point, that you want maximum symmetry. For that reason, if it had been my experiment, I would have chosen an octahedron with alternating polarity on the faces. In Bussard's design, there is a lack of symmetry between the 6 coils/faces where the magnetic flux goes in and the 8 corners where it comes out again. But maybe it is more important to have a large number of faces than this kind of symmetry. I suspect that he used circular coils because they are easy to make, and he used 6 of them because a cube is easy to assemble. Although I am not ready to trust Bussard on everything, I assume he was not so stupid that he didn't insulate the vertices of his model. On the other hand, it seems he gave up pretty quickly on making a multi-turn version of his NPG Polyhedral Grid. If you're into geometry, it's a lot of fun thinking about the magnetic geometry of his grid. As a physicist, I am worried that you have to get the basic principles right before you begin optimizing, and I suspect he has not done that. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] 08:02, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

==Homeopathy rough draft finished==

I have finished my draft of the [[Homeopathy]] article. The draft is a rough approximation of what it should be like. It obviously has some flaws in it's format and wording right now but they will be kinked out within the next couple of days. Right now what I want is for you, if you're interested in helping to improve the article, to come to the articles talk page. There we will all discuss the article and how it could be improved before we replace the current homeopathy article with it. In order for this to work we need to follow a few rules. The first rule, the most important rule, is that no one but me can edit the rough draft. &lt;u&gt;Do not edit the rough draft.&lt;/u&gt; This precaution is used to prevent edit warring and loss or addition of information that might not be up to consensus. Don't worry, It's just a draft and you'll have all the time you want to make changes after we've replaced it with the current article. The second rule is that all proposed changes in the rough draft must be made on the talk page of the rough draft and must be clear and concise. At that point anyone involved will discuss the proposed changes and if agreed by consensus they will be implemented. We will do that until there is no disputes or disagreements. After all disputes are hammered out, we will replace the [[homeopathy]] article with the rough draft. At that point there shouldn't be anyone needing to make huge edits, and if you do see an edit that you want to make, be sure to add a note on the talk page PRIOR to making the edit so that consensus can be reached and then you should make the edit. If you have any questions you can leave me a message on my talk page. Here is the link to the rough draft [[User:Wikidudeman/Homeopathdraft|Link to rough draft]].

I'll wait a few more days and see if any other people make proposed changes though, Tell me what you think of it currently and if you see a problem with it then please propose some changes on the talk page for me to make to it. I want to make sure everyone agrees on the article before replacing it so that edit wars don't instantly begin. Thanks.

Hey Art, I plan to implement the homeopathy rough draft( [[User:Wikidudeman/Homeopathdraft|link]]) by September 1st, 5 days from now. Unless of course more proposals are made to change it, in which case I will postpone the implementation until it is ready and agreed upon. Some things concerning the rough draft are still in discussions, which can easily continue once it goes live. An example is the inclusion of mentions of [[Jacques Benveniste]]. Other things can easily be fixed after a week or so of copy editors from the general public going over it and removing redundancy and rewording sentences to be more brief and precise, which will cut down size of the article including the lead without removing relevant info. So If by September 1st I receive no more suggestions on improving the rough draft then I will replace the [[Homeopathy]] article with it. If you see problems with the draft, please make suggestions on improving it. Even if the suggestions might have already been made, just make a new post with the suggestions so that we can discuss them. Here is the link to the rough draft again: '''[[User:Wikidudeman/Homeopathdraft|Link to rough draft]]'''. Thanks.

== Homeopathy ==

The proposal to split the [[Homeopathy]] article into separate articles is not a good idea. Prior to the rewrite of the article, It was split into 5 or 6 separate articles. One on the &quot;history&quot; of homeopathy. A few on each tenet of homeopathic philosophy. One on criticism of homeopathy. Etc. This mass of articles was impossible to navigate through and they all generally contained redundant info except for the small amount of info differentiating them per the name of the article. I merged them all into that one article and cut down all of the redundant material. I would suggest that the best way to solve this is not to split the article into other articles but to try to best summarize the scientific studies as a whole. Using only the most reputable and reliable sources or meta-analysis and simply summarizing them in a NPOV manner.

It doesn't have its own article now, but it could have one -- maybe I'll even write one, if I can get around to it.  Until then it seems to make sense to have links go right to it.  As the category page says, &quot;Do not replace these redirected links with a link directly to the target page.&quot;

Maybe I'm wrong and no one will ever write an article on it (which would surprise me, since a lot of articles mention it) -- but even then the link still goes to the right place.  Of course it will be a redirect until an article is made, but I don't think it's that bad.

I actually often remove redirects myself, but I don't think this is one to remove.  Still, since you reverted me, I'll [[WP:0RR]] and leave it.

(Answering here to avoid posting on homeopathy articles) &lt;s&gt;I mean that the study says that homeopathy seems to have no effect beyond placebo. It also says &quot;scientific implausibility of the basic concepts that underlie homeopathic thinking,&quot;, altought out of context, it surely refers to the law of similars, increased effect with decreased dose, etc, which go against stablished principles of modern science. So, while it doesn't specifically say &quot;it contradicts scientific principles&quot;, it's also clear that it does say at all &quot;it is in agreement with scientific principles&quot; &lt;/s&gt; Ah, forget it, I see that it needs to be ''exactly the same wording down to the last word in the same order'' in order to get past the filters in place, not sure if this is good or bad --[[User:Enric Naval|Enric Naval]] ([[User talk:Enric Naval|talk]]) 08:50, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

Hi Art,

Could you avoid inserting comments into the middle of other people comments like in talk:homeopathy. In moderate doses it's not too big an issue, but if it gets out of hand then it becomes next to impossible to tell who's saying what since the sections lose their signature.

== Note from John Brandenburg ==

Dear Art, 

I note you are supporting deletion of my article, but you have at least asked for a second opinion and I thank you for this. I also note that , like myself , you are a plasma physicist who has worked on aneutronic fusion, as have I. I consider it will one day save the world from global warming.  I am also from Oregon originally, ( Medford).  Perhaps my theory is not noteable, I have not made a effort to make it into a headline, but I will soon, because i have decided it is time. What if i succeed? 

So i ask you to reread the article and consider as a plasma physicist, who is familiar with the ExB drift, and with cosmology ( like most plasma physicists , since the known cosmos is 99% plasma, it gives us a license to be cosmlogists) , to look at the article, and ask yourself:  are its physical premises in obvious error?  Are its results for G, for the Hubble time, and  the temperature of the CBR noteable? 

I am not a &quot;surfer dude&quot; with a E (8) unified field theory,  I am a working plasma physicist, who like many of our vocation in the US , being unable to do fusion, we have gone into space, where i work on plasma propulsion and other plasma technologies. I can build and run a langmuir probe, a coax plasmas into doing what i want.  That makes me stay close to the practical. My theory is good physics, as for being noteable, that is simply a new project to me. 

with every good wish

== Re: What is kept by a decision to keep? ==

Basically, when a discussion is closed as keep, that means that there is consensus that the article as it was on March 2007 was satisfactory enough for an independent article. That being said, since the AfD took place over a year ago, newfound developments could very well have made that AfD void (see [[Wikipedia:Consensus can change]]). If there is consensus to merge, that can be done at the talk page, and is the best option if there is just a keep v. merge debate. If there's a keep v. merge v. delete battle, AfD is generally a better option, but in this case you guys seem to be coming to a consensus rather nicely. To answer your questions in short, keep = to keep the content in some form, merges can be decided by consensus on the talk page. Hopefully I answered your questions fully.

You would have missed the part where I said I don't put much credence in the claims.

== Bayesian priors and belief ==
Your comment about Bayesian priors strikes a cord with me.  I have noticed how intuitive reasoning (in the immediate belief or recognition sense of the word) shows the workings of a probabilistic depedency model.  All training data seems to have been subconsciously processed to form a maximum likliehood estimate.  A good example is face recognition being affected by the place or environment where the face is encountered. No big surprise given that nueral networks are probabolistic dependancy models.

Taking perhaps a different direction, I have also been struck by how the filtration of incoming information based on past information causes people to become polarized, yet clustered, in their beliefs. In recent years, this became very noticeable in the divisions between political camps.  Belief in seemingly unpolitical matters like whether global warming is real became predictable based on political affiliation.

I had an idea for developing a model that would cluster people into political camps without relying on aprior divisions like race, sex, income, etc.  A naïve Bayes model with a hidden variable predictive of cluster was what I had in mind.  I do not mean to be misleading, I never knew the math very well and have forgotten much of what I learned.  The training data would use a bunch of candidate questions.  Part of the model-building process would be to find which small group of questions best sorted people into clusters that were predictive of voting behavior and political views.  Next step would be a nationwide study to get the population distribution of clusters (too expensive, idea fails here).  In future polls you ask the cluster sorting questions along with whatever else you are interested in and use the cluster information to correct for sample bias.  I was sure it would work better than demographics and would also be useful in building focus groups.

Getting back on track, I though it would be interesting to study how people decide what is true and whether there was something to be learned about distinguishing between functional and disfunctional belief forming habits or rooting our weak premises.

== Only smoke? Or possibly some fire? ==

Hello Dr. Carlson. I've read with interest your entries at Talk-Polywell.org as well as some of your contributions here at WP. I respect your approach of testing an idea or theory's strength by subjecting it to the most rigorous scrutiny. I also understand that you have limited time and must choose your topics of interest. I was hoping you were familiar with an article by Dr. David Goodstein, of CalTech titled, &quot;Whatever Happened to Cold Fusion?&quot; If not, I was hoping I could interest you enough to read it [http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/fusion_art.html here].

With respect to Dr. Goodstein's article, a recent (April 19, 2009) 60 Minutes piece profiled the work of Energetics Technologies. The 60 Minutes piece is linked on the company's commercial [http://superwavefusion.com/ site]. Also on the company's site is a presentation demonstrating their technique that is mentioned in the 60 minutes piece.

If you have followed along this far, my question is whether you think Energetics' technique might be a realistic way to increase the &quot;x&quot; that Dr. Goodstein discusses in his article?

[[User:Krellkraver|Krellkraver]] ([[User talk:Krellkraver|talk]]) 10:55, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

: If x were really the key, as Goodstein speculated 15 years ago, we would know it by now. &quot;If not, then the whole story I have told you is nothing but a curious footnote to a bizarre and ugly episode in the history of science.&quot; My gut reaction to the &quot;SuperWave&quot; business is that it is implausible and sounds like hocus pocus. And I'm just talking about whether they can get higher concentrations that way. From there to cold fusion is still several light years. Do not invest. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] ([[User talk:Art Carlson#top|talk]]) 11:21, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks for your insight, Dr. Carlson. [[User:Krellkraver|Krellkraver]] ([[User talk:Krellkraver|talk]]) 21:18, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

:::Dr. Carlson, I just came across the discussions here. There is a paper by [[Michael McKubre]] in the Low Energy Nuclear Reactions Sourcebook (2008) ([[American Chemical Society]] and [[Oxford University Press]]), reporting ''Replication of Condensed Matter Heat Production,'' which covers replication of the Energetics Technologies work by McKubre at SRI and at ENEA in Italy. Whatever the phenomenon behind what are now overwhelming reports of excess heat (153 peer-reviewed papers), correlated with helium (several confirmations) at 25 +/- 5 MeV/ He4 (compared to d-d -&gt; He4 fusion, 23.8 MeV), charged particle radiation (many reports), helium correlated with excess heat, and low level -- but significant -- neutrons (Mosier-Boss, [[Naturwissenschaften]], Jan 2009, &quot;Triple tracks ....&quot;), it's clear that the reaction is rare and difficult to set up; it was not until 2007 that research groups began reporting 100% excess heat, i.e., in every cell. (He Jing-Tang, Frontiers of Physics in China, 2007).

:::There are many theories now, but there is one that I find interesting: There is an article in that same ACS Sourcebook by Akito Takahashi and Norio Yabuuchi, ''Study on 4D/Tetrahedral Symmetric Condensate Condensation Motion by Non-Linear Langevin Equation.'' In it, he predicts, using [[quantum electrodynamics]] (I think!) to predict that if what he calls a Tetrahedral Symmetric Condensate forms, that it will fuse 100 percent per TSC formation. The TSC appears to be seeded with two deuterium molecules, crossed and confined in the cubic palladium lattice (the most efficient packing); as I'm sure you know, deuterium dissociates in palladium and does not exist in the molecular form there; but at the surface, this configuration might rarely form; the deuterium nuclei would be in a tetrahedron (and is there some relationship as in the [[Oppenheimer-Phillips process]], i.e., those deuterons could be polarized as the system collapses, with the neutrons to the center, thus able to approach more closely, perhaps closely enough that the strong force takes over, this is not a simple two-body problem as is the norm in plasma physics.) I'm unclear on it, but it seems that the TSC, as a &quot;condensate,&quot; is a [[Bose-Einstein condensate]].

:::There is another paper in Naturwissenschaften, May 2009, by Kim, proposing Bose-Einstein condensate formation as an explanation for the apparent nuclear reactions in palladium deuteride. If Takahashi is right, the fusion reaction isn't d+d -&gt; He4, rather it's 4d -&gt; Be-8 -&gt; 2He4 + 57.6 MeV. This reaction produces no neutrons, except from secondary reactions caused by the hot alphas. I've asked researchers in the field about this theory, and they seem to think that there isn't enough secondary radiation, and the charged particles detected by the SPAWAR group and others are at too low an energy, but I've seen no good study on this. It appears, in any case, that earlier objections based on theoretical predictions of reaction rates and resulting radiation involved limited assumptions about what reactions to consider.

:::However, from the massive work in the field, it's now quite clear (to me and to many others) that there are nuclear reactions taking place (there is no other plausible explanation for the copious charged particles and the low levels of neutrons, this is using CR-39 which is not vulnerable to the noise of electronic detectors and other artifacts that plagued Fleischmann and others, this recent analysis shows that early reports of low levels of neutrons were, some of them, probably accurate, but these were dismissed because they were at levels way too low to explain the reported heat, assuming deuterium fusion. Using co-deposition, these results are consistent and there are controls.

:::Back in January, I happened to notice, from Jehochman Talk, that JzG had blacklisted lenr-canr.org and newenergytimes.com, unilaterally, out of process. I looked into it and saw that he was involved at [[Cold fusion]], so I warned him and that led to a process which eventually took us before ArbComm, where my claim of action while involved was sustained and JzG was reprimanded.

:::However, I started to look into the field. I had closely followed the original announcement when it hit the media in 1989, and, in fact, I very quickly bought $10,000 worth of palladium. When it seemed to be a flash in the pan, I ended up roughly breaking even, and I'd concluded, with practically everyone else, that cold fusion was bogus. However, when I started reading the sources in January, I saw that this may have been a premature conclusion. Fleischmannn's excess heat measurements were never actually shown to be wrong, but the difficulties of replication made it easy to assume so. In fact, when Fleischmann ran out of his original batch of palladium, even he couldn't get it to work again for quite a while. In hindsight, it's obvious. The reaction in bulk palladium requires loading to exceed roughly 90%, and microcracks in the palladium prevent high loading. Not just any palladium will do. And with bulk palladium, it takes weeks of electrolysis to get sufficient loading, the early attempts at replication weren't patient enough -- or had unusable palladium, or other problems. However, the [[SPAWAR]] group (that reported neutrons last year) uses a codeposition technique that immediately produces 100% loading, and these cells start producing heat and radiation very quickly and consistently. But codeposition is a research technique, it's not likely to work for energy production.

:::Indeed, it's very possible that no CF technique will ever produce practical commercial power. However, the first question, for the science of this, is whether or not these reactions take place at all. Nobody rejects [[muon-catalyzed fusion]] because it can't be used to brew a cup of tea.

:::Now, the Wikipedia situation. Because I'd filed an RfC on JzG, I started to attract a lot of negative attention. I got flack for even discussing the research at [[Talk:Cold fusion]], and when I started to put in reliably-sourced material that should have been non-controversial, it was reverted out, and the page was protected twice; the first time I was involved, because after so many reverts I did, on May 21, insist a bit. But the next revert war on June 1 did not involve me. However, I was banned from the article and its talk by [[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]], and all this is before ArbComm right now. My purpose here? Simply to suggest that, as a plasma physicist, you might be in a good position to understand the sources and to help insure that the article fairly represents the balance found in reliable source.

:::What I've called the cabal (see the RfAr) relies upon the 1989-1990 reviews, including the 1989 DoE review, which was so highly negative that only one member of the panel, apparently, didn't support Huizenga's view as co-chair that the whole thing was preposterous bogosity, in order to claim that cold fusion &quot;is rejected by mainstream scientists.&quot; Now, it's obvious that &quot;most scientists&quot; reject cold fusion. But in 2004, there was another DoE review, as I assume you know. In that review, on the crucial excess heat question, half the 18-member panel considered the evidence for excess heat conclusive. My guess is that this may represent the breakdown of the panel into chemists and physicists! -- but that is speculation at this point. And one-third the panel considered that the evidence for a nuclear origin was &quot;somewhat convincing.&quot; Because the bureaucrat summarizing the results was concerned with the purpose of the panel, to determine funding, and because the funding recommendations (modest funding under existing programs) were the same as in 1989, what's been emphasized in our article is that &quot;the conclusions were the same.&quot; Which easily implies total rejection. But, in fact, they were very, very different.

:::The 2004 DoE panel shows, unmistakeably, that cold fusion is controversial science, but not rejected by consensus ''among those who are informed.'' The panel was informed through a paper, some of them may have studied the references, and a one-day meeting was held where cold fusion researchers made a presentation.

:::Robert Duncan, mentioned above by Krellkraver, was a skeptical physicist hired by CBS News to investigate cold fusion, and he was amazed by what he found. He recently ran a seminar where most of the major researchers were invited, and there is video of that seminar.

:::We can't put all the stuff I mentioned above in the article, it's way too new, as to the science. But there is plenty of reliable source that we now have, including peer-reviewed secondary source, for text that is much more neutral. And, while my ban was converted to a community ban, and has expired, WMC still claims that he can block me if I edit the article. I [[WP:DGAF|DGAF]] if he blocks me, it would merely accelerate matters, but I also don't do disruption. In the mean time, do you think you could look at the article. There is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cold_fusion/Archive_33#Poll.2C_reserved_section a poll recently archived] that contained a matrix with diffs between a set of relevant versions: May 21, as protected in the first edit war (some progress had been made); May 31, just before the second edit war; June 1, just before it was protected; and May 14, which WMC reverted to for some very strange reason, and the current version derives from that, stuff that had been accepted by consensus remains removed.

:::If you could look at those diffs and comment, or otherwise watch and assist with the article, it would be appreciated. Knowledgeable editors are needed to ensure that the consensus formed there is based on knowledge and not just on knee-jerk opinion. I wasn't there to push a POV, but to try to balance the article, with consensus, following our guidelines. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 03:05, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== Do shaped charge jets = plasma? ==

Good day sir!
I'm merely a layman in the field of high energy physics, but I find plasma to be a fascinating topic to research for the fun of it.  I was hoping that you could disambiguate something for me since you appear to be the man in the know.
Several times while reading various articles about linear shaped explosive charges, the author(s) refer to the 'jet', (which is a ductile metal, most commonly copper that is shaped and accelerated by the surrounding explosive to cut through hardened objects such as steel beams or concrete) as a plasma.  
My question is this;  Is enough energy imparted by the explosive to the metal such that the electrons jump up an orbit and are able to 'boil off' and ionize the metal jet into a plasma state, or was the term used flippantly in the articles that I read?    
If you have the time to answer, that would be super.  Since the question is of a trivial nature, it's not going to hurt my feelers any if you fail to reply.

Thanksamillion,

: Sorry, I can't say. The fireball from an explosion is certainly a plasma, but if the energy is transfered from the fireball to a metal, it depends. Enough energy might be transfered to ionize the metal into a plasma, or else it might only be melted. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] ([[User talk:Art Carlson#top|talk]]) 09:19, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

== Not quite as small... ==

Hi Art!

While I'm still associated academically with TUM , I'm no longer working there for mu salary - I'm in Karlsruhe at the moment. How is life at the LRZ? 

--[[User:Stephan Schulz|Stephan Schulz]] ([[User talk:Stephan Schulz|talk]]) 10:53, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

: Stessig, this month, non-stop meetings and conferences. I'm working in D-Grid, so I come to Karlsruhe quite a bit, but fortunately not again until September. If I ever have some time to kill I'll try to look you up. I also have a sister-in-law in Karlsruhe. A small world, but not after all nano scale. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] ([[User talk:Art Carlson#top|talk]]) 11:00, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

==Science vs Astrology==
Hi Art, I re-read your statement and realised in my rush to reply, I didn´t take it all in. I am quite busy these days. Apologies. I have now added in bold, three points, to my original answer. These points hopefully more directly address the questions raised by you, even if I realise additional reflection would be needed to make them more concise.

== Typo? ==

Hi Art. In this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Astrology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=318826023 edit] I suspect you made a typo: astrology/astronomy. Thrice you write &quot;astronomy&quot;, where &quot;astrology&quot; is probably what you meant. It's an easy one to make. -- [[User:BullRangifer|Brangifer]] ([[User talk:BullRangifer|talk]]) 13:51, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

== Spheromak = spherical tokamak? ==

Are these two terms equivalent? [[User:Maury Markowitz|Maury Markowitz]] ([[User talk:Maury Markowitz|talk]]) 21:58, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
: No. A spherical tokamak is simply a tokamak with an extremely small aspect ratio, i.e. the column down the middle is very thin in comparison to the outer radius. A spheromak is a compact toroid, i.e. has no central column at all. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson]] ([[User talk:Art Carlson#top|talk]]) 08:01, 12 November 2010 (UTC)
