There appears to be an error here about the date of Sancho IV's birth. If you look at the year 1257 in this encyclopedia it (&amp; Encyclopedia Britannica) states that he was born in 1257?

:A fair number of sites give the date as May 12, 1258, but since none of them look particularly reliable, I just changed it to 1257/58, until/unless we get some better info. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 22:59, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)

note:
Sancho IV didn't have any uncle named &quot;huan&quot;. the only &quot;huan&quot; exists on that constellation is his younger brother, the king of valencia.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.230.95.201|80.230.95.201]] ([[User talk:80.230.95.201|talk]]) 23:52, 14 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
