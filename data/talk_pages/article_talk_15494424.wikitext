== Initial Page ==
I have created this page (version as I created available at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taste_of_Tasmania&amp;oldid=187857035 oldid=187857035]. I do not wish to expand it as '''I am an employee of [[Hobart City Council]]''' and involved in the production of The Taste, so there is an obvious conflict of interest. I hope this article is considered NPOV and it was created because there were existing links to [[Taste of Tasmania]] despite there not being a page here. I am happy to answer any questions if you email them to me; my email address is available from [http://mine.mjec.net/ my personal website].

==Redirect to Taste Festival==
This festival has been renamed to the [[Taste Festival]] and I have redirected to that page to reflect this. I don't wish to expand to avoid COI issues as I am an employee of Hobart City Council.
