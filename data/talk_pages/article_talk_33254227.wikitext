==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Sydney fox]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Sydney fox]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Sydney fox|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Ansumang|ansuman]] ([[User talk:Ansumang|talk]]) 22:01, 29 September 2011 (UTC)
==Removing Speedy at [[Sydney fox]]==
{{#ifeq: no | yes | Hi Research16019, you recently removed a deletion tag from [[Sydney fox]]. Because Wikipedia policy [[WP:CSD|does not allow]] the creator of the page to remove speedy deletion tags, an [[WP:BOT|automated program]] has replaced the tag. Although the deletion proposal may be incorrect, removing the tag is not the correct way for you to contest the deletion, even if you are more experienced than the nominator. Instead, please use the talk page to explain why the page should not be deleted. Remember to be patient, there is no harm in waiting for another experienced user to review the deletion and judge what the right course of action is. As you are involved, and therefore potentially biased, you should refrain from doing this yourself. Thank you,| [[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia, thank you for taking the time to create a page here. It might not have been your intention, but you recently removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from a page you created yourself. Because Wikipedia policy [[WP:CSD|does not allow]] the creator of the page to remove deletion tags, an [[WP:BOT|automated program]] has replaced the deletion tag you removed from [[Sydney fox]]. Please do not continue to remove the deletion tag, instead, if you disagree with the deletion, you can follow these steps:
#Go to the page by clicking [[Sydney fox|this link]]. Once there, select the button that says &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:Sydney fox}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}} &lt;b style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.
#This will take you to the talk page, where you can make your case by explaining why the page does not meet Wikipedia's [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]].
Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do. For further help about the deletion, you could contact the user who first placed the tag or a [[Wikipedia:Highly Active Users|highly active user]] who is willingly to help with deletion. This message was left by a bot, so please do not contact the bot about the deletion. Thank you,}} - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 22:02, 29 September 2011 (UTC)
