Not moved.  Given the result of the AfD and the facts here, there does not appear to be a primary topic.  So the dab page should be moved to the main name space.  [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 20:10, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

[[:Mysterium (Scriabin)]] → [[Mysterium]] — This is the primary article for the term &quot;[[Mysterium]]&quot;; as such, the disambiguator &quot;(Scriabin)&quot; is unnecessary. —[[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 16:26, 5 February 2010 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''': This shouldn't be the primary article, as an unfinished work by a mid-importance composer isn't exactly overwhelmingly notable. The sci-fi novel is a much more likely search target, but there are so many uses (some of them Classical in the historical not musical sense) that the best bet is to move this to [[Mysterium (music)]] or [[Mysterium (composition)]] or something (I assume WikiProject Classical music has preferences for how to disambiguate neo-classical works?) and move [[Mysterium (disambiguation)]] to [[Mysterium]].  I.e., I agree that &quot;(Scriabin)&quot; should not be used as a disambiguator if we can help it, but also have to agree with whoever disambiguated this page to begin with that it isn't &quot;primary topic&quot; material. — &lt;font face=&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]]'''   &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:SMcCandlish|Talk⇒]] ʕ(&lt;sup&gt;Õ&lt;/sup&gt;ل&lt;sup&gt;ō&lt;/sup&gt;)ˀ&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|Contribs]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 21:59, 5 February 2010 (UTC) '''PS:''' I also have to note that There's no consensus to make this article the target of the [[Mysterium]] redirect to begin with. [[Mysterium]] was redirected to a ''[[Myst]]''-related topic at [[WP:AFD]]; its re-redirect to this article was a one-editor change, not the result of a discussion, and was motivated by personal opinion about the importance of the topic, according to the edit summary of that redirect change not long ago. The only clear compromise is to move [[Mysterium (disambiguation)]] to [[Mysterium]]. — &lt;font face=&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]]'''   &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:SMcCandlish|Talk⇒]] ʕ(&lt;sup&gt;Õ&lt;/sup&gt;ل&lt;sup&gt;ō&lt;/sup&gt;)ˀ&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|Contribs]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 22:07, 5 February 2010 (UTC)
*'''Support''': The sci-fi novel mentioned above does not even have a Wikipedia article, so I fail to see how it is of equal importance or interest to readers. Meanwhile, Scriabin, far from a &quot;mid-importance&quot; composer, has influenced artists across genres, and he remains popular and relevant a century after his death. -- [[User:Yano|Yano]] ([[User talk:Yano|talk]]) 22:42, 6 February 2010 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Scriabin is important no doubt, but &lt;strike&gt;the primary topic is the Latin word&lt;/strike&gt;&quot;mysterium&quot; is ambiguous in itself, being just a Latin word, term or concept used in a large variety of contexts and with a variety of meanings. So the disambiguation page looks to me like a more appropriate candidate for the title &quot;mysterium&quot;. [[User:Cavila|Cavila]] ([[User talk:Cavila|talk]]) 20:54, 7 February 2010 (UTC)
*'''Support as nominator''' - The primary topic is not the Latin term because there is no article about the Latin term &quot;Mysterium&quot;. Disambiguation pages serve to quickly direct users to the intended article, not to engage in explanations of the uses of terms like a Wiktionary article does. If a user types &quot;Mysterium&quot; in the search bar, the likeliest intended article is the one about the musical work. We should never assume that users are attempting to use Wikipedia as they would a dictionary. [[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 14:02, 8 February 2010 (UTC)
:Sorry for being unnecessarily hazy there. What I should have stated right away is that like McCandlish, I'm not convinced that there is clear evidence of a primary topic at all and that users typing in &quot;mysterium&quot; will be usually looking for the piece by Scriabin. The other thing which I was considering earlier today is that per the example of [[Avatar]] and [[Avatar (film)]], &quot;primary&quot; doesn't necessarily mean the most popular page. Because ''mysterium'' is not only a word, but also occurs as a term and concept in English-language sources about a variety of theological, liturgical and even mystical traditions, with a measure of fluidity, the title of the article, &quot;mysterium&quot;, seems to be more than a tad ambiguous.

== &quot;Fortean aggregate&quot;? ==

The term &quot;Fortean aggregate&quot; appears only in this article, is not explained anywhere on Wikipedia, and a Google search only yields results from copies of the same text or paragraph. It is also not self-explanatory and sounds bogus to me. Even if it isn't, the reference is useless unless explained/wikilinked/sourced.
