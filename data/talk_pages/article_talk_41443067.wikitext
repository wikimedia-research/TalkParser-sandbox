==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:File:Tom Colicchio.jpg]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

A tag has been placed on [[:File:Tom Colicchio.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#F9|section F9 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the image appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted images or text borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:File:Tom Colicchio.jpg|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-imgcopyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; -- [[User:ТимофейЛееСуда|'''Тимофей''']][[User_talk:ТимофейЛееСуда|'''&lt;font color=&quot;#00f00ff&quot;&gt;ЛееСуда&lt;/font&gt;''']].  20:30, 23 December 2013 (UTC)
