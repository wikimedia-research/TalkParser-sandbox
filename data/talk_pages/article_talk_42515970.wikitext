[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:A.amitkumar|A.amitkumar]]. I noticed that you made a change to an article, [[:Julian Dicks]], but you didn't provide a source. I’ve removed it for now, but if you’d like to [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|include a citation]] to a reliable source and re-add it, please do so! If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:A.amitkumar|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-unsor-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;&quot;&gt;[[User:a.amitkumar|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Grey;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;A m i t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']][[WP:Professionalism|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;웃 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']]&lt;/span&gt; 16:14, 17 April 2014 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:East West Records]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=623327731&amp;oldid=623325602 here] to [[East West Records]] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]].  The external link(s) you added or changed (https://www.facebook.com/eastwestrecords?fref=ts/&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \bfacebook\.com) --&gt;) is/are on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks! --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 16:10, 29 August 2014 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, please ignore this notice.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam0 --&gt;

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Richard Yin|Richard Yin]]. I noticed that you recently removed some content from [[:Listen (David Guetta album)]]&amp;nbsp;without explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an accurate [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. If this was a mistake, don't worry; I restored the removed content. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[WP:Sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Richard Yin|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-delete1 --&gt; --[[User:Richard Yin|Richard Yin]] ([[User Talk:Richard Yin|talk]]) 14:07, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
:''If this is a [[Network address translation|shared IP address]], and you did not make the edits, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''&lt;!-- Template:Shared IP advice --&gt;

[[File:Information orange.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Please do not remove content or templates from pages on Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Listen (David Guetta album)]], without giving a valid reason for the removal in the [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. Your content removal does not appear constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]. Please make use of the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] if you'd like to experiment with test edits. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-delete2 --&gt; [[User:This lousy T-shirt|—This lousy T-shirt— ]] ([[User talk:This lousy T-shirt|talk]]) 14:19, 10 October 2014 (UTC)

:Upon closer inspection I've noticed that the iTunes sources, where the tracks are supposed to come from, don't seem to have most of the tracks shown. I've gone ahead and removed the track listing. For the record, please use the edit summary to explain large deletions, and use the &quot;Show preview&quot; button to avoid causing things like reference tag errors. Moreover, I would suggest you stay away from editing pages you have a connection with in order to avoid violating our [[WP:conflict of interest|conflict of interest]] policies. --[[User:Richard Yin|Richard Yin]] ([[User Talk:Richard Yin|talk]]) 14:23, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
