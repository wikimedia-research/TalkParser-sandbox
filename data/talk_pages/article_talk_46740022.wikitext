[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:I dream of horses|I dream of horses]]. I noticed that you recently removed all content from [[:Waveshaper Musician]] with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waveshaper%20Musician&amp;diff=668099270 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; without explaining why. In the future, it would be helpful to others if you described your changes to Wikipedia with an [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]]. If this was a mistake, don't worry, I restored the page's content. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:I dream of horses|my talk page]].  Thanks. [[User:I dream of horses|I dream of horses]] &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #ffa500;background:#ffce7b;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you reply here, please [[WP:ECHO|ping me]] by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ping|I dream of horses}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to your message. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; {{small|([[User talk:I dream of horses|talk to me]]) ([[Special:Contributions/I dream of horses|contributions]])}} @  10:52, 22 June 2015 (UTC)&lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-blank --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-delete1 --&gt;

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. This is a notice to inform you that a tag has been placed on [[:Waveshaper (Musician)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A3|section A3 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because it is an article with no content whatsoever, or whose contents consist only of external links, a &quot;See also&quot; section, book references, category tags, template tags, interwiki links, images, a rephrasing of the title, a question that should have been asked at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help]] or [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|reference]] desks, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article. Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Waveshaper (Musician)|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-nocontent-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;[[User:Masum Ibn Musa|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#0000CD;color:gold;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Masum Ibn Musa&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Masum Ibn Musa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;'''Conversation'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 13:10, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
