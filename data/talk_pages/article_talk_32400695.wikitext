The result of the move request was: '''page moved'''. Consensus was there for a move.  The presumption that there will be more, is not a reason to pre disambiguate this name.  It can be changed if needed.  I'll also note there was a history merge from when both names were used. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 21:07, 21 July 2011 (UTC)

#'''Support''': Thankfully, its not reached a state where bomb blasts in Mumbai are so frequent that we need a date and the year - I would go with 2011 Mumbai bomb blasts. In the event there is another attack this year, that can be covered in the prologue section of the 2011 Indo-Pak War article. (No, but more seriously, we can add dates in the event there is more than one attack this year, but as of now the year should be sufficient).

[[User:Veryhuman|Veryhuman]] ([[User talk:Veryhuman|talk]]) 20:38, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' - It seems that only one article, that of 26/11, is named as [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] per year and the others per date (vide list by User:Veryhuman) though in some cases there is only attack/blast/bombing per year. Logically speakiing, a person unfamiliar to the topic would think that &quot;2011 Mumbai bomb blasts&quot; would be about all the bomb blasts in Mumbai in 2011 and not about those on a date - so the proposed title is misleading in a way, as it is in the case of 26/11.

== Ajmal Kasab's birthday? ==

The citation verifying Ajmal Kasab's birthday coinciding with the terrorist attacks is a piece of handwritten document shared on scribd that lacks adequate verifiability. Due to the sensitive nature of this fact in question, I am currently removing this piece of information(for the fear of it being used as a rumor-manifesting quote) temporarily. Should any editor find additional verifiable sources for this information, it may be reinstated

::::: Sorry, discussions on the page linked above do not represent an adequately verified source for this issue.

Can someone get non-copyright images related to the incident? Any Wikipedia editors having access to photos clicked on personal camera phones etc. might be useful. The current image part of the article (the kabutarkhaana one) is really not that relevant

== Background section not needed at this point ==

The following was in Background section
&lt;pre&gt;
==Background==
Zaveri Bazaar, which is near the [[Mumba Devi Temple]], was one of the scenes of the [[25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings|twin bombings]] in 2003 that killed 54 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three get death for Gateway, Zaveri Bazar blasts|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-07/india/28210461_1_hanif-syed-m-r-puranik-ashrat-ansari|accessdate=13 July 2011|newspaper=The Times of India|date=07 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[26/11]] attacks also occurred on [[A Wednesday]].
&lt;/pre&gt;
Highlighting of '''A Wednesday''' is not warranted in this article. There is no basis for highlighting the fact that both attacks happened on a Wednesday, it mostly is purely coincidental. If it is kept as is, it may be used for rumor-mongering in the media. I am deleting that line.

The rest of the background section is a single line which does not warrant a separate section. If other info crops up during investigations, then a background section can be put in. Right now, that section hasnt reached an adequate level of maturity. [[User:Veryhuman|Veryhuman]] ([[User talk:Veryhuman|talk]]) 20:22, 13 July 2011 (UTC)

As with all such events, politicians are quick with there condemnation, other political rhetoric, and outpourings of sympathy and condolences, giving rise to potentially unlimited soundbytes. We must avoid the temptation to use (and overuse) this material. I have therefore substantially removed such unencyclopaedic text from the reactions section.

== Reactions section being reformatted unnecessarily ==

It appears to me that the reactions under the &quot;International&quot; subtitle were changed from the standard Wikipedia list format to a more uncommon prose format. Can the editor in question (who made the said changes) explain his logic behind the same? Wikipedia generally follows a list format for international reactions to events of global magnitude to ensure easy and specific verifiability of the quoted reactions.

Unless the editor [[Ohconfucius]] specifically lists his objections to this standard practice followed on Wikipedia, the edits may be reverted.

:::Oh puleez! If only you could have bothered to read the [[#WP:QUOTEFARM, WP:NOT#NEWS and WP:NOT#MEMORIAL|preceding section]], where I laid out my rationale. Just because &quot;standard format&quot; exists and someone has toiled to make it so, doesn't mean it's worth keeping. I see you've kept my version of 'domestic reactions, but insist on your 'international' one. I don't know who bothers reading such crap rhetoric anyway, repeated umpteen times, one for each country or leader who has a soundbyte. Only on getting to the last line does the reader feel short-changed by the sheer lack of substance. No, I probably would have stopped half way, and skipped to what Obama had to say.  I guess that's why the call such comments &quot;empty rhetoric&quot;. I just call them &quot;sweet nothings&quot;. --[[User:Ohconfucius|&lt;span style=&quot;color:Black;font:bold 8pt 'kristen itc';text-shadow:cyan 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;Ohconfucius&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Ohconfucius|&lt;sup&gt;¡digame!&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:34, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::: I agree that most readers might not bother reading all reactions or soundbytes, as you call them, listed in there. On the other hand, we as editors of an encyclopedic page have to ensure that we present all the facts related to the matter without any kind of POV. You, for example, might have skipped to [[Barack Obama]]'s reaction, I might be more interested in knowing the Sri Lankan President's take on the matter, hence we've to list both quotes. We've retained your edit on the domestic reactions because that is how most of the domestic reactions section in other such pages look like, and we appreciate your work regarding the same. 'Lack of Substance' is not our fault, its that person who's giving the soundbyte. All that being said, we do have to maintain a standard format conforming with that followed on other similar articles, should we ever change them to prose format as well, we do it here too. Assume good faith [[User:Batram|Batram]] ([[User talk:Batram|talk]]) 09:13, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
::::: Don't you get a sense of déjà vu as you are working down those comments, and then fail to remember precisely who said what, because they are all so darn similar? Actually, I feel the best solution to this 'lack of substance' is to summarise. Then we give all the information, without boring the reader, and without needing to consider which country'e views needs to be given greater weight. You may have noticed that I had left a sentence dedicated to the Pakistani response, which is quite notable due to the historical tensions. The others are marginally so, and could easily be grouped. --[[User:Ohconfucius|&lt;span style=&quot;color:Black;font:bold 8pt 'kristen itc';text-shadow:cyan 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;Ohconfucius&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Ohconfucius|&lt;sup&gt;¡digame!&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:16, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::::: LOL. Agree as I do with all of your sentiments (including the feeling of a resigned déjà vu in reading these useless reactions), there is a greater chance that when we decide to summarize a certain section as neutral as a list of international reactions, there is a very frightful chance that an inadvertent POV might creep in deciding which reactions to highlight and which not to (a point, again, demonstrated by the fact that you would have preferred to keep the Pakistani and US reactions in greater highlight). I think the best thing to do right now would be to keep this section (at least the international) as it is and add the reactions as and when they become available. Later, once sufficient information becomes available on other sections of this item other than this section and the article becomes prohibitively large, we may decide to move this section to a separate article titled [[Reactions to the 13 July 2011 Mumbai Bombings]] [[User:Batram|Batram]] ([[User talk:Batram|talk]]) 10:45, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

i am the anonymous from below. i agree that representing some points of view over others is not npov.&lt;br/&gt;
in this article the 'reactions' section is by eye the biggest so far, though it doesn't directly belong to the topic of the article, but is rather related to the topic. i dont support the idea of moving reactions into a different article - i am not so much knowledgeable in the rules of wikipedia, but common sense suggests me that the idea of having a set of uniform articles, whose content may be fit entirely into the template, wont live here for long.&lt;br/&gt;
i think that compactly summarizing reactions, as ohconfucius proposed, is a good solution -- [[Special:Contributions/178.123.215.82|178.123.215.82]] ([[User talk:178.123.215.82|talk]]) 14:55, 16 July 2011 (UTC)

==Categories==
Murder in India category be removed. -[[User:Animeshkulkarni|Animeshkulkarni]] ([[User talk:Animeshkulkarni|talk]]) 07:32, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:Why? This article is about a [[mass murder]] in India. [[User:Jim Michael|Jim Michael]] ([[User talk:Jim Michael|talk]]) 16:51, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
::Check [[Ignoratio elenchi]]. Although Jim's argument is valid, ''Murder in India'' is not a relevant category. Murder is committed against a known foe..the victim is known. Terrorism is committed against a state and has entirely different objectives and methods than a murder. [[User:Veryhuman|Veryhuman]] ([[User talk:Veryhuman|talk]]) 20:55, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::This is not a case of ignoratio elenchi. [[Murder]] does not require that the perpetrator knows the victim. There are thousands of murders by strangers in the world every year. A political and / or religious motive does not mean it is not murder. Terror attacks in which victims are killed are simultaneously terrorism and murder. [[User:Jim Michael|Jim Michael]] ([[User talk:Jim Michael|talk]]) 23:22, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
::::Thats why it is [[Ignoratio elenchi]]. It is a valid argument, but Murder category is not relevant. The closest category '''Mass murder''', which itself is a sub-category of Murder. Such a structure makes categorization more relevant (See [[Wikipedia:Overcategorization]]). For example, it would be improper to categorize [[My Heart Will Go On]] in Category:Music, although it clearly is a song with music. [[User:Veryhuman|Veryhuman]] ([[User talk:Veryhuman|talk]]) 03:26, 17 July 2011 (UTC)
:::::In that case, [[:Category:Mass murder]] and [[:Category:Murder in India]] should be added. They are both relevant to this article, and are subcategories of [[:Category:Murder]]. It would be overcategorising to add the parent cat Murder, but not to add subcats of it. [[User:Jim Michael|Jim Michael]] ([[User talk:Jim Michael|talk]]) 18:17, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

==Proposed edits==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Edit semi-protected}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
In section Reactions, Domestic, second paragraph. 

{{Quote box
 |quote=... general secretary Rahul Gandhi was reported to have remarked that it was impossible to stop all the terror attacks. He said that 99 per cent of the terror attacks had been stopped in the country, thanks to various measures, including improved intelligence. {{strikethrough|He's also supposed to have further said}} He also said that &quot;We work towards defeating it, but it is  ...}}

Either the statement was made or not. If there is doubt, then the statement should be removed. The cited source, if assumed to be reliable, the statement was made by Rahul Gandhi.   --[[User:PunitRathod|PunitRathod]] ([[User talk:PunitRathod|talk]]) 14:58, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:I think we already have a lot of reactions in the article. Sonia and PM should be enough I think. '''[[User:MikeLynch|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000080&quot;&gt;Lynch&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:MikeLynch|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00BFFF&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 15:09, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::'''Support''' [[PunitRathod]]  I had used that phrasing only temporarily so long as the news piece in question was still relatively new, and hence, not verified through multiple sources. I think its safe to assume now that he actually said that [[User:Batram|Batram]] ([[User talk:Batram|talk]]) 15:11, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::'''Oppose''' [[MikeLynch]] The statement in question is not, as indicative by the wording, primarily a statement of condemnation or condolence, but includes the said person's point of view over a wider range of issues, including [[Terrorism in India]], [[Indian Police]] capabilities and US involvement in Afghanistan. Mr. Rahul Gandhi's opinion, as the General Secretary of the AICC and a MP, not to mention a Gandhi scion, especially such a diverse tone from those of the other members of the government, needs to be represented here for a balanced POV [[User:Batram|Batram]] ([[User talk:Batram|talk]]) 15:17, 14 July 2011 (UTC)
:::: I would agree with [[User:MikeLynch]]. There was no official response from PM when the edit was made. However, if there is still need to preserve Rahul Gandhi's opinion, we can compress the paragraph in one or two sentences. In the current state, there is too much importance (as compared to the rest of the section) to the view of a single person who is not even voicing the official view of the Government.  --[[User:PunitRathod|PunitRathod]] ([[User talk:PunitRathod|talk]]) 15:46, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

==i criticize the 'reactions' section==

i think it is not needed, as everyone knows their reactions. i read these reactions in every notable terrorist attack, and they are always the same. while they are all notable, are not they trivia? i think only the reactions with controversial  points of view should be presented, as if, say, some organisation or state praised the attack, or maybe, if such reactions are present, only then to present all other reactions, therefore in the article where no controversial points of view are among reactions, no reactions section in needed at all -- [[Special:Contributions/178.123.215.82|178.123.215.82]] ([[User talk:178.123.215.82|talk]]) 14:25, 15 July 2011 (UTC)

in all truth, i just don't like to read all the leaders being very 'disturbed' about attacks, as those people are ignorant and obviously not concerned about any attacks, maybe only in their countries. they release their 'reaction' and the second later they forget about it. it is hypocrisy, that's why i hate these sections. it is only the template, and who knows? maybe they got such a template in the government with only a country place to fill in. i only wanted to raise the awareness of the situation, maybe there is some lawful wikipedia way to forbid them -- [[Special:Contributions/178.123.215.82|178.123.215.82]] ([[User talk:178.123.215.82|talk]]) 14:32, 15 July 2011 (UTC)
:I agree with your statement, but am unsure what to do; those people are important nevertheless. '''[[User:MikeLynch|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000080&quot;&gt;Lynch&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:MikeLynch|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00BFFF&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 15:23, 15 July 2011 (UTC)
:: I think the unregistered user above has more or less echoed the same arguments presented in the preceding section by the [[User:OhConfucius]]. As I said before, I completely empathize with the resignation that a reader must endure while going through the apparently 'drab' and 'routine' reactions that follow any such attacks. Nonetheless, the fact is that wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we editors cannot be, should not be, the ones making the choice as to what information might be potentially useful and what may not to readers; our job is to decide what information is relevant to the article in question and can be verified with sources. Again, in support to my argument, I use what the unregistered user above said: &quot;i think only the reactions with controversial  points of view should be presented, as if, say, some organisation or state praised the attack, or maybe, if such reactions are present, only then to present all other reactions, therefore in the article where no controversial points of view are among reactions, no reactions section in needed at all&quot;. What we are effectively doing here is representing a negative POV bias, by saying that only negative reactions to such incidents are worthy of mention. Finally, its also about this: Wikipedia is a global website. I might be a citizen of an XYZ country with a size half that of Mumbai and might be heavily interested in knowing what my country's take on this attack was, even though India or Indian readers might not be that bothered about it. Remember the reason every such article has a reactions section, it is to ensure a globally sensitive source of information, and not to make the victims or the citizens of the country which faced the attack feel better. Like I said earlier, if any editor feels this section is getting too long, feel free to move it to a new wiki page. Hope this settles this issue once and for all.

::: With all due respect to Batram, [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]] is a [[WP:FA|Featured Article]] that has what he could consider non-standard format for 'Reactions' section. I think it works well. We really don't need all the bullshit rhetoric that's in the reactions section right now. --[[Special:Contributions/88.160.245.226|88.160.245.226]] ([[User talk:88.160.245.226|talk]]) 15:37, 17 July 2011 (UTC)
:::: Concur with the above that it is meaningless rhetoric. Any response that we cite and quote must be directly relevant to that country's actual involvement. None of the countries whose reactions are quoted had their own people as victims; none offered these statements as confirming material or other support. I have therefore removed it outright. However, if there are any statements from interested parties, I would have no objection to including these.&lt;p&gt;I think that comparisons to 'reactions' section in the Ürümqi riots article isn't a valid one. My opinion is that there is great interest in the potential human rights issue, and controversy over what the PRC stated was 'terrorism' and incitement from 'foreign forces', thus perpetuating the debate as to the definition of terrorism. That is what makes the inclusion appropriate and relevant to that article. --&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffffff;border: 1px solid;&quot;&gt;[[User:Ohconfucius|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000; background-color:#ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ohconfucius&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ohconfucius|''ping / poke'']]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:44, 5 February 2013 (UTC)
