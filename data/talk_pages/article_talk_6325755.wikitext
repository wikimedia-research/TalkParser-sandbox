== Conflicts with a book tittle ==

Opportunities is also a title of a book by Dr Edward deBono http://www.edwdebono.com/debono/oppo.htm

Is there any proof that In The Night is the basis for &quot;The Bad Touch&quot;? The songs are only vaguely similar. It more resembles an old 1980's song by Blockhouse called &quot;Disco Hit&quot;. See my discussion post on the article for [[The Bad Touch]].

: Along similar lines, surely ''In the Night'' is derived from John Carpenter's theme for ''[[Assault on Precinct 13]]''; they even have the same screeching strings noise. -
