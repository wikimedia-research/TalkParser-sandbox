==Song articles==

Hello Madchester. I've seen your song articles and find they make good stubs. For information on creating song articles and how to categorize them correctly, see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs]]. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. --[[User:Moochocoogle|Moochocoogle]] 05:20, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Category creation==
Hi, you can create category pages using the search function.  Just type in whatever category title you want, but make sure it's prefixed with Category:  Then, click the link that appears at the top of the Search Page results that has the category name you want, it has a link to the index next to it.  Then, you can edit the page like a regular page.  For example, I created the Coldplay songs by searching for: Category:Coldplay songs Then, I followed the above steps.  Have fun.  [[User:^ ^|^ ^]] 07:26, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==[[Weezer]]==
Hey, Madchester. The cover you posted on the new [[Weezer]] album ''[[Make Believe]]'', is it official? It was on the official website too. -- [[User:Mike Garcia|Mike Garcia]] 05:24, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Coldplay ==
I realize that, but Britpop bands as Radiohead, Oasis and Blur don't have them. Yet many other acts also don't have them. It will be very... how to say it.. not intersting to read countless awards of R.E.M., U2, Stones or Beatles. So, to summarize it, I think that such awards section is at least to say it redundant. But if you want to put it back - do it. You wrote this article after all. Despite my contributions on other Britpop acts, I can't have much word on the future developping of this page, except the minor restructuring I did IMHO for the best.
===Template box===
No problem on all the Coldplay work. To be honest, I've actually just been trying to follow your example. With regard to the Radiohead box, I just copied it to make the Coldplay one. To edit the box, just go to [[Template:Coldplay]] and then its like any article. Thanks for the message and I'll keep up the work. Thanks. [[User talk:Cbing01|Cbing01]] 07:41, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
===Stars===
As far as I have seen, the stars are being phased into many of the album articles. I only did the Coldplay articles after I had seen or edited myself, many of the other bigs bands, such as Radiohead, The Beatles, etc. I don't know who started the process, only the person who created the stars images, and that is just because they are all linked to the user page. Thanks for the question. [[User:Cbing01|Cbing01]] 30 June 2005 16:20 (UTC)

== suggestion ==

Please watch how you use the term &quot;nazi&quot; in any context, out of sensitivity to others.  Also, don't name call.  -- [[User:Netoholic|Netoholic]] [[User talk:Netoholic|@]] 07:28, 2005 Mar 27 (UTC)

:Last I checked, I think you were being compared to a [[Soup nazi]]... way to take things out of context. Keep it up. you're living up to a &quot;distinguished&quot; rep --[[User:Madchester|Madchester]] 19:20, 2005 Mar 27 (UTC)

==Regarding The Amazing Race 6==

You mentioned on the Amazing Race 7 article that the trivia was starting to get a bit pedestrian, then went on to edit The Amazing Race 6 article with &quot;Don and Mary Jean were chosen in an open casting call&quot;.  I haven't reverted it or anything, but I'm just curious as to how that is any less pedestrian than the example you used of Uchenna and Joyce being the 3rd black couple. [[User:Mo0|Mo0]]&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[User Talk:Mo0|talk]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 08:39, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Netoholic==
Are you sure Netoholic is a &quot;she&quot;?  Regardless, he/she and I have had LOTS of disagreements in the past, this is just more of Nethoholic's abuse of me.  [[User:RickK|Rick]][[User talk:RickK|K]] 08:10, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2/Evidence]] -- plus, drop me a line ''before'' you get banned again for reverting him.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Xiong|Xiong]][[Image:Xiong2char.png]][[User talk:Xiong|talk]] 12:36, 2005 Apr 2 (UTC)

==Three revert rule==

You have been blocked for 7 hours under the [[WP:3RR|three revert rule]]. If you wish to appeal please contact another [[Wikipedia:List_of_administrators|administrator]] or the [[Wikipedia:Mailing_lists|mailing list]].[[User:Geni|Geni]] 18:40, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== [[Speed Of Sound (single)]] ==

Hello,

Could you please stop reverting this page.  If you look at Coldplay's [http://www.coldplay.com/site.php Official Website], under News---&gt;X&amp;Y album artwork and tracklisting, you'll see that the official title of the single is &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; (with of not capitalized).  I think the [[Speed Of Sound (single)]] page should redirect to the proper title.

[[User:Acegikmo1|Acegikmo1]] 20:06, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Hi,

:Perhaps I'm being persnickety, but I consulted a few style guides [http://www.muhlenberg.edu/mgt/pubrel/style.html] [http://www.umw.edu/policies/style_guide/style_guide_by_category/titles/default.php#s] and found that prepositions less than four letters long should not be capitalized.  [http://aitech.ac.jp/~ckelly/midi/help/caps.html This page], which is listed on [http://www.reference.com/Dir/Reference/Education/Subjects/English_as_a_Second_Language/Grammar/ reference.com], gives a good outline of the rules regarding capitalization of song titles.  I do think it's important that we try to adhere to these rules on Wikipeida.  Maybe I'm being obsessively, but I think we should work to get all song titles to follow this style.

:Cheers,

== About the Link (Amazing Race 7) ==

The link you included about Meredith's foot injury doesn't seem to be working. [[User:Jendeyoung|Jendeyoung]] 27 April 2005 19:12 PST

== Coldplay - Yellow US Chart position ==

I got the Coldplay - Yellow US Chart position, from: http://www.chartfreaks.com/ [[User:secfan|sec]][[User_talk:secfan|fan]] 15:43, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)

== The Amazing Race spoiler tag ==

I can totally understand why you might want to have a spoiler tag on [[The Amazing Race]], however the main article does not warrant a tag.  I have read your comments on the talk page but they don't justify having a spoiler tag; the main article contains no details about winners and losers that might spoil the show for someone new to it.  The other articles ([[Alias (TV series)]], [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions]], etc) that you cite on the talk page are clearly justified in using the spoiler warning because they contain either detailed plot information or lists of winners. On the talk page you mention that several other people have tried removing the spoiler warning and you've re-added it. Maybe that's a sign you're being a bit of a zealot. You were the one to add it initially, so maybe you need to take a step back and take an objective look at the article.  --[[User:NormanEinstein|NormanEinstein]] 21:04, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
:Please, dude, I don't need to be patronized about being respectful of the reading audience. I could always turn that argument around and say that you're being disrespectful of a reader's intelligence by implying that they need to be warned that an article about [[The Amazing Race]] might contain information about the show, but I won't do that.  I will leave you to watch over your self-appointed domain. --[[User:NormanEinstein|NormanEinstein]] 23:26, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

== Circumnavigation in AR7 ==

Then they could have come through London then Istanbul on the way to India, and on from there. Or, not have Phil use the phrase 'race around the world' in his spiel every episode. But, to me, this was a 'race halfway around the world and back'; not the same thing. You may disagree, but I felt a bit cheated by the whole thing. [[User:Radagast|Radagast]] 17:02, May 11, 2005 (UTC)
:Yes, you have a point. And it's a small complaint in a mostly exemplary season; I guess I'm just a stickler for the semantics of it all! [[User:Radagast|Radagast]] 17:51, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

== About all AR ==

Madchester, forget about all the roadblocks on seasons 2 &amp; 5. The current use is (various teams, [[The Amazing Race 5|Season 5]]). [[User:ApprenticeFan|ApprenticeFan]] 23:54, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== X&amp;Y ==

The album has not been leaked, this is true. But,  the track lengths have been released. Check BN.com

== Mysterious Roadblock in leg 8 on TAR5 ==

Hey Madchester, The roadblock on leg 8 in TAR5 is it before or after detour in Dubai?

== Location a roadblock on leg 8 in TAR5 ==

Madchester, what part and location in Dubai did the roadblock? I saw the pictures at [[CBS]] website. Brandon, Chip, Colin, Karli &amp; Linda did these task.

== Brothers &amp; Sisters ==
I think you will find that I am right. Check the official site. It says &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, not &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;. Or alternatively you could tell by looking at the cover art.

Also, if you look here: http://www.hotandcoldplay.com/discography/brotherssistersukep-back.jpg , you will find that Crash produced the album and Mike Beaver engineered and mixed the tracks. 
I don't want to be rude, but I resent you accusing me of not checking my facts when you haven't checked yours.

Leaving your opinions about Hot and Coldplay aside, you can see from that image that I am correct, or you could check the official site as I suggested.
Also, isn't it a bit superfluous to have a page (both incorrectly named) for the EP and the single? Surely an entry in the single category would suffice, especially seeing as though the official site lists it as a single.

I'm not going to go around changing what you have done, because I have better things to do, but that image I sent you should settle our little dispute about names and producers in my favour on its own.
If you want to make the entries more accurate, then that's up to you.
As to the EP and single entries, do what you will.

== A secret message from SYSS Mouse ==

So. It is Kenny here. Just dropping a message to confirm that I got your message.

BTW, you planning to go to Live 8 thing? [[User:SYSS Mouse|SYSS Mouse]] 02:17, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Sweden Pit Stop ==

The [[Sunset|sunset]] in [[Stockholm]] last [[August 19]], [[2004]] at 8:26 pm CDT (6:26 pm GMT), They have a celebration in the AF Chapman ship on the following morning, and there is a 36 hour pitstop in this leg.

== Coldplay's Muse influence ==

From [[Fix You]]. Do you have a source for this?

== Epilog v. Epilogue ==

please explain why you've changed, without explanation, a heading in the [[Bonnie and Clyde]] article to another variant of the same word. i added the word, and it was fine. why the change? thanks. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 05:07, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Kasabian ==

Well, okay, I'll put up a notice at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] and see what other people think.  Generally, Wikipedia article names are meant to be simple (see [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)]]), and needless disambiguation should be avoided.  There are 764,000 Google hist for [http://www.google.com/search?q=kasabian kasabian], 188,000 hits for [http://www.google.com/search?q=kasabian+album kasabian album], and 27,000 for [http://www.google.com/search?q=linda+kasabian linda kasabian]. &amp;mdash;[[User:Mulad|Mulad]] [[User talk:Mulad|(talk)]] June 30, 2005 06:12 (UTC)
:Also, when you move a page, you should use the move button, rather than cut and paste text from one article to another. &amp;mdash;[[User:Mulad|Mulad]] [[User talk:Mulad|(talk)]] June 30, 2005 06:32 (UTC)

== Deleting other people's work ==

When deleting other people's edits or writings from articles please say '''why''' in the edit/revert description box. It's polite, it explains what you're doing and it's what the damn box is there for in the first place. Namely, the [[Stereophonics]] article you continue to revert. — [[User:Cuahl|Cuahl]] 3 July 2005 18:42 (UTC)
:''(in reply to [[User talk:Cuahl#stereophonics|my talk page]]...)''
:That's a fair point - I hadn't realised that it was the same thing on a load of articles, but I thought it might have been a good idea to mention their appearance, and it's not that half-bad a line to put in until someone can provide more information don't you agree? — [[User:Cuahl|Cuahl]] 4 July 2005 07:14 (UTC)

== [[Live 8]] ==

my bad i didnt see they already had links. thanks for correcting me. [[User:Jobe6|Jobe6]] July 4, 2005 17:47 (UTC)

It thoughtit looked more tidywith all of them linked, is there any wikipedia policyon this as if you miss one on a long list it makes it easier to find i'd have thought. --[[User:Ashl|Ashl]] 6 July 2005 16:49 (UTC)

== Oswald &amp; Danny ==

I read from somewhere that they are partners, used in the context of Same-Sex couples. Can't find the source now, seems the link to it is dead.

== Park Place ==

Madchester do you mind not deleting the concert listing I have for Park Place, I am trying to make a year by year concert listing for the park if that is possible--[[User:Jbfraser|JB]] 07:06, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

== read more closely ==

&quot;''How is the mention of the end of the NHL lockout considered vandalism?''&quot;

Exactly my point... it '''isn't vandalism''', so admins should not being using &quot;rollback&quot;. -- [[User:Netoholic|Netoholic]] [[User talk:Netoholic|@]] 20:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

==In the news==

&quot;It should ideally be a story of an international importance, or at least interest.&quot; The NHL story is of no interest (let alone importance) outside North America. [[User:Proteus|Proteus]] [[User_talk:Proteus|(Talk)]] 20:34, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
