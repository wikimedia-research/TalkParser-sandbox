[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:117Avenue|117Avenue]]. An edit that you recently made to [[:Gemini Awards]] seemed to be a test and has been removed. If you want more practice editing, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:117Avenue|my talk page]]. Thanks!&lt;!-- Template:uw-test1 --&gt; [[User:117Avenue|117Avenue]] ([[User talk:117Avenue|talk]]) 04:09, 13 August 2014 (UTC)


can I leave a message here? I went to your talk page but couldn't find how to leave a message. The formatting of my changes to the Gemini page was incorrect but the content was not intended to be a test - I was trying to indicate that the links were all dead because the Geminis have changed to a another name and website. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/174.7.60.178|174.7.60.178]] ([[User talk:174.7.60.178|talk]]) 22:59, 14 August 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;
:Yes, which is why there is an article on the [[Canadian Screen Awards]], but the [[Gemini Awards]] were still a thing, and has an article. [[User:117Avenue|117Avenue]] ([[User talk:117Avenue|talk]]) 04:18, 15 August 2014 (UTC)
