{{{icon|[[Image:Information.svg|25px|]]}}} Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia, and thanks for working to improve the site with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hoboken,_New_Jersey&amp;curid=125235&amp;diff=532796279&amp;oldid=532661492 your edit to Hoboken, New Jersey], as we really appreciate your participation. However, the edit had to be reverted, because Wikipedia cannot accept [[WP:V|unsourced material]] or [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. This includes material lacking cited sources, or obtained through personal knowledge or unpublished [[WP:SYNTH|synthesis]] of previously published material. Wikipedia requires that the material in its articles be accompanied by [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable]], [[WP:V|verifiable]] (usually [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary]]) sources explicitly cited in the text in the form of an [[WP:Inline citation|inline citation]], which you can learn to make [[WP:CS|here]]. If you ever have any other questions about editing, or need help regarding the site's policies, just let me know by leaving a message for me in a new section at the bottom of [[User talk:Nightscream|my talk page]]. Thanks. :-) [[User:Nightscream|Nightscream]] ([[User talk:Nightscream|talk]]) 04:49, 13 January 2013 (UTC)
