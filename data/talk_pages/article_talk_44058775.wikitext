Hi Marta,

Our Lowell History edit-a-thon is coming up on Dec 7 and wanted to know if you would spread the word through your Boston city networks. Here is the link to our page:

Thank you

Hope you are keeping warm.

Thank you for hosting us at the Archives. It was my first official edit-a-thon and was a lot less intimidating than I expected. It was great to learn how to upload photos and to help educate about a city that I love. I will keep you posted about the edit-a-thon for Lowell on Dec 7.
