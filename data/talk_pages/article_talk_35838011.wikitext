This is an automated message from [[User:MadmanBot|MadmanBot]].  I have performed a web search with the contents of [[:Dakabin Station Action Group]], and it appears to be a substantial copy of http://www.dakabinstationactiongroup.com. 

It is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists. If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article. The article will be reviewed to determine if there are any copyright issues.
