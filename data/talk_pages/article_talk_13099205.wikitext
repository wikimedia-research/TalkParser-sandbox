Hi, Jeremyschw, and [[WP:WELCOME|welcome to Wikipedia!]] I see that you recently created a page, [[Bjy]]. I'm glad that you're excited about contributing to the encyclopedia! A preferable way to make a page before uploading to the Mainspace (which is the space on which articles are hosted, where [[Bjy]] is now) is to create the page within your user space in order to make it how you want it to be before putting it up on the main space. [[Bjy]] as it stands now is a candidate for [[WP:CSD|speedy deletion]] (in my opinion) because it doesn't provide any context for what it's about. It would be a great idea for you to create that page at [[User:Jeremyschw/Bjy]] (your userspace) and work on it there. Once you have the complete information and article, feel free to add it to the mainspace! I hope what I'm saying makes sense, and I'm sorry if it doesn't. Go ahead and place &lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on this page if you still need a hand and someone will be along to help you soon. You might also want to check out the [[WP:INTRO|introduction]] for a crash course in Wikipedia. Thanks again and, again, welcome!

A tag has been placed on [[:BJY]] requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on [[Talk:BJY|the article's talk page]] explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  [[User:Pilotboi|Pilotboi]] &lt;small&gt;/ [[User_talk:Pilotboi|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Pilotboi|contribs]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:55, 5 September 2007 (UTC)
==License tagging for Image:Beth Jacob Youth.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Beth Jacob Youth.jpg]]. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
* [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
* [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]]. If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 02:06, 5 September 2007 (UTC)
