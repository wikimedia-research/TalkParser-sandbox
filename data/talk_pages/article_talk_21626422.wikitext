==Push / Precious ==
Thanks for the updates on [[Push: Based on a Novel by Sapphire]]... let's discuss it [[Talk:Push: Based on a Novel by Sapphire|on the talk page of the article]], though.--[[User:Larrybob|Larrybob]] ([[User talk:Larrybob|talk]]) 21:42, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
*We should try to have verifiable information in Wikipedia articles, not based on Original Research. [[WP:OR]] For instance, if I went out and saw Tyler Perry's new film this weekend and saw the trailer for Precious, and saw what was being used as the title of the film, then edited Wikipedia based on that information, that would be original research.--[[User:Larrybob|Larrybob]] ([[User talk:Larrybob|talk]]) 19:47, 21 February 2009 (UTC)
