Hey there! Nice to see you around Wikipedia. However, may I just point one thing out: Wikipedia isn't a strategy guide! While people do often come here looking for information on how to complete games this is not what Wikipedia is for. I suggest you try www.gamefaqs.com , that should contain all the information you need for getting to the first cannon. Thanks for visiting! :D [[User:Smomo|Smomo]] 21:14, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
