[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Please do not add inappropriate external links to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Huawei]]. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]], nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites with which you are affiliated, and links that attract visitors to a web site or promote a product.  See [[Wikipedia:External links|the external links guideline]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam guideline]] for further explanations. Because Wikipedia uses the [[nofollow]] attribute value, its external links are disregarded by most search engines. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it.

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please stop adding inappropriate external links to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Huawei]]. It is considered [[Wikipedia:Spam|spamming]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#ADVERTISING|Wikipedia is not]] a vehicle for advertising or promotion. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, additions of links to Wikipedia will not alter search engine rankings.

Lets limit the inclusion of that link to the [[Huawei E220]] article. It's appropriate there. We have an internal link to the [[Huawei E220]] article from the [[Huawei]] article. That is more preferable than linking to the external link.

You are very welcome to bring the idea of adding that external link to ''any'' Wikipedia article by presenting the idea on an article's talk page.

Please do not re-introduce the link to an article without discussing it first. If discussion does not take place before the introduction of that link to any article we'll assume it's just a spam effort.

:On closer look, I see that you removed the manufacturers link to their own product page and replaced it with that other link. I don't think that's acceptable even on the [[Huawei E220]] article.
