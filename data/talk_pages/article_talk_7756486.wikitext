==Orphaned non-free media (Image:Lilian-Gish-1928.jpg)==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Lilian-Gish-1928.jpg]]'''. The media description page currently specifies that it is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, it is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the media was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that media for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that all non-free media not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

==Fair use rationale for Image:SR-Good-Night.jpg==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|70px|left]]
Thanks for uploading or contributing to [[:Image:SR-Good-Night.jpg]]. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  [[WP:FURG|here]].

Please go to [[:Image:SR-Good-Night.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you. &lt;small&gt;Do you want to [[Template:Bots#Message notification opt out|opt out]] of receiving this notice?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale --&gt; -[[:User:Nard the Bard|Nard]] 15:27, 7 June 2008 (UTC)

==Speedy deletion of [[:Image:Grand-Anse-Bay.jpg]]==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Image:Grand-Anse-Bay.jpg]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done for the following reason:

&lt;center&gt;''''No evidence of free license seen at source website; no evidence of permission to free license''''&lt;/center&gt;

Under the [[WP:CSD#General_criteria|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not meet  basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article]], and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Image:Grand-Anse-Bay.jpg|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]].

A tag has been placed on [[:File:Schneider-Trophy-cover.jpg]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#F9|section F9 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the image appears to be a blatant [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted images or text borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:File:Schneider-Trophy-cover.jpg|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[File talk:Schneider-Trophy-cover.jpg|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-dbimgcopyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Eeekster|Eeekster]] ([[User talk:Eeekster|talk]]) 23:15, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:The-Devon-Belle-.jpg]]'''. I noticed that while you provided a valid copyright licensing tag, there is no proof that the creator of the file agreed to license it under the given license. 

If you created this media entirely yourself but have previously published it elsewhere (especially online), please either 
* make a note permitting reuse under the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] or another acceptable free license (see [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags/Free licenses|this list]]) '''at the site of the original publication'''; or
* Send an email from an address associated with the original publication to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}''', stating your ownership of the material and your intention to publish it under a free license. You can find a sample permission letter [[WP:CONSENT|here]]. If you take this step, add {{tl|OTRS pending}} to the file description page to prevent premature deletion.

If you did not create it entirely yourself, please ask the person who created the file to take one of the two steps listed above, or if the owner of the file has already given their permission to you via email, please forward that email to '''{{NoSpamEmail|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}}'''. 

If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], use a tag such as {{tlp|non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags#Fair use]], and add a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|rationale]] justifying the file's use on the article or articles where it is included. See [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied, too.

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, please add a link to the page from which it was taken, together with a brief restatement of the website's terms of use of its content. If the original copyright holder is a party unaffiliated with the website, that author should also be credited. Please add this information by editing the [[:File:Cheret-Aperitif-Mugnier-.jpg|image description page]].

If the necessary information is not added within the next days, the image will be deleted. If the file is already gone, you can still make a [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request for undeletion]] and ask for a chance to fix the problem.&lt;!-- Template:You can request undeletion --&gt;

Please refer to the '''[[WP:IUP#Adding images|image use policy]]''' to learn what images you can or cannot upload on Wikipedia. Please also check any other files you have uploaded to make sure they are correctly tagged. Here is a [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Lordprice}} list of your uploads]. If you have any questions or are in need of assistance please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-no source-notice --&gt; [[User:Sfan00 IMG|Sfan00 IMG]] ([[User talk:Sfan00 IMG|talk]]) 20:09, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
==File permission problem with File:OC-Club-Sketch-.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:OC-Club-Sketch-.jpg]]''', which you've attributed to {{NoOTRS60}}. I noticed that while you provided a valid copyright licensing tag, there is no proof that the creator of the file has agreed to release it under the given license. 

If you are the copyright holder for this media entirely yourself but have previously published it elsewhere (especially online), please either 
* make a note permitting reuse under the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] or another acceptable free license (see [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags/Free licenses|this list]]) '''at the site of the original publication'''; or
* Send an email from an address associated with the original publication to '''permissions-en@wikimedia.org''', stating your ownership of the material and your intention to publish it under a free license. You can find a sample permission letter [[WP:CONSENT|here]]. If you take this step, add {{tl|OTRS pending}} to the file description page to prevent premature deletion.

If you did not create it entirely yourself, please ask the person who created the file to take one of the two steps listed above, or if the owner of the file has already given their permission to you via email, please forward that email to '''permissions-en@wikimedia.org'''. 

If you believe the media meets the criteria at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], use a tag such as {{tl|non-free fair use}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags#Fair use]], and add a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|rationale]] justifying the file's use on the article or articles where it is included. See [[Wikipedia:File copyright tags]] for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have provided evidence that their copyright owners have agreed to license their works under the tags you supplied, too. You can find a list of files you have created in [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Lordprice}} your upload log]. '''Files lacking evidence of permission may be deleted one week after they have been tagged''', as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Files|criteria for speedy deletion]]. You may wish to read the Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:image use policy|image use policy]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Di-no permission-notice --&gt; '''[[User:Ronhjones|&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid;color:#dfdfdf; padding:1px;background:#ffffdf&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ron&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;h&lt;/font&gt;jones&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]'''&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ronhjones|&amp;nbsp;(Talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:06, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
