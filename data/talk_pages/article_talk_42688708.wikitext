Hello Xgenmedia. It has been over six months since you last edited your [[WP:AFC]] draft article submission, entitled &quot;[[User:Xgenmedia/sandbox|sandbox]]&quot;. 

The page will shortly be deleted. If you plan on editing the page to address the issues raised when it was declined and resubmit it, simply {{edit|User:Xgenmedia/sandbox|edit the submission}} and remove the {{tlc|db-afc}} or {{tlc|db-g13}} code. Please note that Articles for Creation is not for indefinite hosting of material deemed unsuitable for the encyclopedia [[WP:mainspace|mainspace]].

If your submission has already been deleted by the time you get there, and you want to retrieve it, copy this code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Refund/G13|&lt;/nowiki&gt;User:Xgenmedia/sandbox&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, paste it in the edit box at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_undeletion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new this link]&lt;/span&gt;, click &quot;Save page&quot;, and an administrator will in most cases undelete the submission.

Thanks for your submission to Wikipedia, and happy editing. &lt;!-- Template:Db-afc-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:JMHamo|JMHamo]] ([[User talk:JMHamo|talk]]) 15:54, 12 November 2014 (UTC)
