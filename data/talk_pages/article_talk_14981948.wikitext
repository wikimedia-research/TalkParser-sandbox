==Needs complete rewrite==

1) First sentence in present tense as if subject is still alive. Mentions &quot;70 years ago&quot; when it is actually by now 80 years ago.

2) Overall tone is eulogistic, with strong praise but little detail or substance. Need more neutral, objective, encyclopedic point of view.

3) Final sentence is advertising copy for Pioneer Investments, does not belong in this biography.
