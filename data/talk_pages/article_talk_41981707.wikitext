Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/99.188.94.36|your contributions]], such as the one you made on [[:Special Olympics]]. Although I appreciate your attempt to fight vandalism here, I reverted your article back its most recently unvandalized version, to make sure we caught all the inappropriate changes. Generally, when you see an article that has been obviously vandalized, it's better to revert it than to try to correct all the changes by hand. Let me know if you would like to know more about how to do this.

I greatly appreciate your efforts to make constructive edits on Wikipedia.  I hope you like the place and decide to stay.  Here are some pages you might like to see:

You are welcome to continue editing without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but many editors recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup&amp;campaign=anonwelcometemplate}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles. For a full outline and explanation of the benefits that come with creating an account, please see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|this page]]. If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] (99.188.94.36) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your comments]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your IP address (or username if you're logged in) and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:Ubiquity|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page. Again, welcome! [[User:Ubiquity|ubiquity]] ([[User talk:Ubiquity|talk]]) 20:15, 18 February 2014 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;
