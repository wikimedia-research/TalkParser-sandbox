==Rationale for deletion of disambiguation page==
Per the [[WP:Disambig]] page, &quot;If only a primary topic and one other topic require disambiguation, then disambiguation links are sufficient, and a disambiguation page is unnecessary.&quot; Since the radio station call letters are the primary identification and the acronym for an astronomical observatory is a secondary identification, a hat note is sufficient and requires no more steps than would a disambiguation page for people seeking the observatory. - [[User:Dravecky|Dravecky]] ([[User talk:Dravecky|talk]]) 05:03, 9 September 2008 (UTC)
