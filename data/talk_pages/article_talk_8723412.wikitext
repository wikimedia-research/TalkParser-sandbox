&lt;div style=&quot;padding:5px; background-color:#E1F1DE;&quot;&gt;'''Dear uploader:''' The media file you uploaded as [[:Image:Bubbles.gif]] has been listed for [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] because you selected a copyright license type implying some type of restricted use, such as '''''for non-commercial use only''''', or '''''for educational use only''''' or  '''''for use on Wikipedia by permission.'''''

==Proposed deletion of Susan Van Horn==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|48px|]]
A [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] template has been added to the article [[Susan Van Horn]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:&lt;b&gt;Declined speedy because there's a claim of importance (known for originating an art style), but gsearch and gnews searches aren't turning up [[WP:N|notability]]. [[WP:COI]] issues don't help.&lt;/b&gt;

All contributions are appreciated, but this article may not satisfy Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion|criteria for inclusion]], and the deletion notice should explain why (see also &quot;[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]&quot; and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]).  You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the &lt;code&gt;{{tl|dated prod}}&lt;/code&gt; notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on [[Talk:Susan Van Horn|its talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised because, even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion process]], the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]] or it can be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to delete is reached.&lt;!-- Template:PRODWarning --&gt; [[User:Fabrictramp|&lt;font color=&quot;#228b22&quot; face=&quot;comic sans ms&quot;&gt;Fabrictramp&lt;/font&gt;]] | [[User talk:Fabrictramp|&lt;font color=&quot;#960018&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;talk to me&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:11, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
