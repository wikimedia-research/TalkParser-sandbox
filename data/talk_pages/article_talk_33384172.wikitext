[[Occupational Privilege Tax]] → {{no redirect|1=Occupational privilege tax}} –

Several (US) states and local authorities have one: it's generic. Per [[WP:CAPS]] and [[WP:TITLE]]: this is a generic, common term, not a propriety or commercial term, so the article title should be downcased. In addition, [[WP:MOS]] says that a compound item should not be upper-cased just because it is abbreviated with caps. Matches the formatting of related article titles.
