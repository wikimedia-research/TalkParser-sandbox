==Compared To==
I have noticed that in many explanations of the viola and how to play it that consistently it is compared to the violin instead of just explaining what it is... We may need to work on that and just explain the viola for what it is and not what it is compared to the violin, if that makes any sense? :)Abby C. 17:46, 12 March 2010 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aquamarine678|Aquamarine678]] ([[User talk:Aquamarine678|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aquamarine678|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I supose that explaining the viola for what it is would be alright... but I think that, as a lot of people know what a violin is like that it is kind of better to compare. :)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Violawow|Violawow]] ([[User talk:Violawow|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Violawow|contribs]]) 09:35, 15 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Viola the whole article==
**Perhaps we should incorporate many of the features as seen in our family instruments (violin, cello).  They seem to be well written.  They do not include violin or cello jokes.  The bass article refers to &quot;notable classical players of historical importance.&quot;  Perhaps that is what should be the criteria for listing the violist, is some significant importance.  The genres that the viola is found should be grouped together and perhaps outlined more (orchestral, chamber music, solo music, modern music, folk music, future avenues-electronic violas?).  debcallico/ut  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.10.219.39|12.10.219.39]] ([[User talk:12.10.219.39|talk]]) 19:29, 15 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Also, maybe the bit about how the observer may mistake a viola and a violin might be taken out of the introduction. This isn't really something to put into the intro. of a viola article. Maybe instead a bit more about the clef should be added? -peacelovehappinesss  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Peacelovehappinesss|Peacelovehappinesss]] ([[User talk:Peacelovehappinesss|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peacelovehappinesss|contribs]]) 23:56, 9 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Violists==

I've added Lillian Fuchs and Rebecca Clarke; I'm not sure if Clarke should be in the list of composers who played viola or, like Hindemith, be listed in the 'violists' paragraph.  I still think the paragraph about jokes is incongruent in this context.  [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 09:19, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

In light of the recent flurry of changes to the list of violists, I request that anyone who makes changes to that list put the names they are adding or deleting in the summary along with a brief description of why they are adding or deleting.  Thanks [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 00:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

After more careful scrutiny of the history of this page, I have come to the conclusion that User 65.88.88.148 is intent on removing people from the list of well-known violists without specific reason (all three of the most frequently removed names are sufficiently well-known violists.  None of these names is going to have the recognizability of, say, [[Yo-Yo Ma]], but that's not a reason to remove them.) [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 06:22, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for giving voice to that. I don't know who's who, but I've been watching the flipping and flopping with silent puzzled amusement. [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 15:03, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

I was amused too....  However if it continues (I hope not!), I may get annoyed.  I believe this is what's commonly referred to as an 'edit war'..... It would be a shame to have to ask an administrator to step in and do something about stopping it. [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 23:21, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

I put a &quot;citation needed&quot; template in the sentence &quot;among the great composers, several preferred the viola to the violin when playing in ensembles&quot;, as it seems like a claim that could easily be more motivated by enthusiasm than actual history. [[User:Hjijch|Hjijch]] 22:26, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

I've added Rivka Golani and Nobuko Imai to the list. Especially Golani, who has a huge international reputation and is one of the few violists who has made her living as a full time soloist. For 25 years she has toured and recorded. Someone keeps removing Golani and Imai from the list. Thats weird. Golani has had more than 50 concertos written for her and more than 200 works in total. I heard her concerts at the Glenn Gould studio and Wigmore Hall and was stunned by her genius. I suspect the individual removing Golani from the list (and Imai, who is an extremely eminent viola soloist, based in Holland but originally Japanese) may not have enough international knowledge of their importance. I havent added Yuri Bashmet as obviously its going to be a challenge to keep Golani and Imai on the list but I hope someone will come forward to stubbornly push for him too. The list as it stood was like a smile with three missing teeth, I have replaced two - please will someone push for Bashmet too. &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Cshelley|Cshelley]] ([[User talk:Cshelley|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cshelley|contribs]]) 4:47, 14 July 2007&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:First of all, you added this comment out of order in the discussion. But more to the point, the reason those names you've added have been removed is simply because the '''sentence''' in which the '''short list of names''' appears is not the place for the definitive, end-all, be-all list of violists in the world. By &quot;consensus&quot; (see the comment in the article text), it's to be limited to a small number (5) of representative players. The &quot;list of violists&quot; article is the place to add any and all names of notable players, not this short list. Please don't push for more list-bloat, which is an endemic problem all across this project (Wikipedia). +[[User:ILike2BeAnonymous|ILike2BeAnonymous]] 17:31, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

Thanks, I have corrected the order for the discussion. I really appreciate your tenacity at policing this entry. It is certainly important to protect against bloat and I can see that this issue emerged before. You (ILike2BeAnonymous) seem to very much dislike additions to the violists/viola player category. You strongly suggested that two entries be removed if I insist upon the Golani and Imai additions. I have reluctantly removed two therefore (and I hope someone else will come along and restore them). You seem to like making the rules here, but anyone can refine a Wikipedia entry. That is what I have done - by adding these two Great violists here. No one, incidentally, has established absolute &quot;objective&quot; criteria for additions to the violists entries. I am confident, however, that if it really came down to it, arbitrators who do the research on Golani and Imai will see that I have made no transgression here whatsoever but have provided the names of two very famous and unusually gifted players who have made extraordinary contributions over decades as viola virtuosi through their recordings and on the international, solist circuit. &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Cshelley|Cshelley]] ([[User talk:Cshelley|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cshelley|contribs]]) 04:32, 15 July 2007&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I must correct you on a few points. I have myself reverted several attempts to re-grow this sentence into a list, so there is not just one editor acting as &quot;policeman&quot;. Neither is there one person who is attempting to make up rules: as you've noticed - rather late in the day - the issue has been discussed before. It would have been nice if you had taken the trouble to re-open that discussion on this page in the first place, rather than attempting to get your own way by conducting an edit war. The consensus reached, reinforced by plain common sense, was that the sentence can't be allowed to carry on growing every time someone sees that their personal favourite is not included. Once that starts, people think that there's no good reason not to add the name of that really great teacher they had in third grade. The fact that no objective criterion for inclusion exists doesn't mean that choices don't have to be made, even if they have to be done by something as crude as a Google search. 

:Just to close with a personal anecdote, a few years ago I persuaded a friend to go with me to a recital by one of the two players you've just added. I had never heard the player, but her reviews and reputation had encouraged me to suggest it. The performance was painful enough for me to have suppressed most of my recollection; when it was over, my friend looked at me in silence for a few seconds and then said &quot;I hadn't realised that the viola was such a difficult instrument&quot;. Odd thing, celebrity. --[[User:Stephen Burnett|Stephen Burnett]] 09:03, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

::Regarding your anecdote: sheesh, that's almost as bad as telling a musician after a performance, &quot;Wow, you certainly have a beautiful instrument there&quot;. +[[User:ILike2BeAnonymous|ILike2BeAnonymous]] 11:14, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks for the above. Whether the performance was liked or not, it acknowledges the arguments that I made, that both are well known and belong on this list. The &quot;common sense&quot; of limiting the list is sensible and the policing factor important as the list could grow to be too large. Its not an issue of one's favourite player, but an issue of accuracy and logic. The existing list of players that had been constructed under the sentence &quot;More recent well-known&quot; had no logic to it and was arbitrary, it was my aim to maintain the established logic in the paragraph by consistency, not one's favourite principal player but international solists of note (whether liked or not). &quot;Rather late in the game&quot; suggests that Wikipedia is a static entity in which no one can come along and make corrections, this is not the case. Finally, the individual referred to above was indeed policing my additions since they were replying to each one of the attempts to add the two players under my Watchlist and giving (actually ordering) instructions to place those names elsewhere. I stand by these additions and am prepared to go to arbitration with them if necessary. Thanks for caring so much about this entry regardless, I think it an important category. I have never engaged in an edit war before, I dont like the term &quot;war&quot;, I prefer the struggle for accuracy and the search for consensus (an ideal that is often never reached or maintained).

:::Well, I'm not going to remove those names, at least not now; my stated intention was to keep the short list short, which you've done. But more to the point, I don't intend to take part in this musical pissing match&amp;mdash;&quot;My violist is more notable than your violist&quot;. Try as you might, at the end of the day, you really cannot make a good argument that violist X is more worthy of inclusion than violist Y (in this short list, remember, not the definitive and all-inclusive scroll of great violists of all time), assuming, of course, that both X and Y are top-level performers. There just aren't any kind of qualitative, objective metrics that would make this possible. (And don't '''even''' mention Google ...)

::::I just added [[Yuri Bashmet]] to the &quot;more recently&quot; group. From [http://www.sonyclassical.com/artists/bashmet/bio.html his bio at the Sony site,] it appears that he is stellar enough to be on the short list. Disclaimer: I am truly clueless as to who's who in the upper reaches of viola players. But, beside his solo appearances, that bio says he has shared the stage with a few names that are pretty widely recognized:

 In a number of major concert halls, including La Scala
 in Milan and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Bashmet
 has been the first violist ever to give a solo recital.
 He has appeared on many occasions with Sviatoslav Richter
 and has performed chamber music with many other leading
 artists, including Natalia Gutman, the Borodin Quartet,
 Gidon Kremer, Viktoria Mullova, Mstislav Rostropovich
 and Maxim Vengerov.

==Brahms Sonatas (op. 120)==
the most recent revision states that brahms transcribed the op. 120 clarinet sonatas himself.  I have heard some debate about this -- regarding whether he actually did it himself or merely approved of it when the publisher presented it to him.  Does anyone have a source for this information?  If not, I'd like to change it back to the previous version, which states that the pieces were originally for clarinet but doesn't make any claim as to who did the transcribing.

:From the Wiener Urtext edition of the E-flat sonata: &quot;In the spring of 1895 the Sonatas were published by N. Simrock, Berlin, together with an arrangement of the clarinet part for viola ... The engraver's copies of the original version (score and solo part) and of the viola part arranged by Brahms still exist. They are located in th Staats- und Universitatsbibliothek, Hamburg ... They were written by a copyist, with numerous corrections and several important alterations in Brahms' hand.&quot; (Hans Christian Muller) The rest of the preface does not seem to doubt that Brahms was the original arranger. --[[User:Quadalpha|Quadalpha]] 00:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::Excellent, thanks.  BTW, we should start citing sources, perhaps this is a good place to start.  [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 23:04, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

:::As documented in my article, http://www.solisti.de/brahms/sonatas120_eng.html which was published in German by the Viola Society, there is evidence that Brahms transcribed the Sonatas Op. 120 himself, although this manuscript is lost.  The published version was based on a manuscript by the copyist Wilhelm Kupfer for the publisher Simrock, which shows evidence of only some hurried corrections by Brahms.  It is not incorrect to state that Brahms made a transcription of these Sonatas for the viola, but nobody alive today has seen this version. - Prof. James Creitz

== Viola jokes == 
I have a psychology book somewhere (a quite serious one) that has something like half a chapter on the viola joke (mainly musing on why the viola and not some other useless instrument like the flute). And I see even Google is getting in on the act of slating violists now: if you search for &quot;virtuoso violist&quot; it mocks &quot;Did you mean:virtuoso violinist&quot;... --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

Viola jokes were the one source of amusement during the long hours I spend  languishing in 2nd violins. http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/jokes/viola.html -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

Methinks we should have some kind of gentle, viola player-friendly reference to those jokes, because orchestra culture wouldn't be the same without them. [[User:Weasel|Weasel]]

:True, orchestra culture wouldn't be the same without them.  But I've always thought of viola jokes as akin to blonde jokes or lawyer jokes or ethnic jokes.  Does an encyclopedia article on lawyers have a reference to lawyer jokes?  Does an article on ethnicity have a reference to ethnic jokes?  It may be a separate category, we can add to [[jokes]] the &quot;musician&quot; joke.  [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 10:13, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
:Whatever the case, I don't believe the viola joke should be the first thing a person sees when they go to the section on &quot;Violists&quot;.  I've re-arranged the paragraphs so that the list of violists appears first, then the list of famous composers who were also violists, and put the reference to viola jokes last.

== Viola vs. Voila ==
About this bit:

''Viola is a common misspelling of the French word voila, often used as a demonstrative exclamation (e.g. ... you mix the ingredients, bake for 40 minutes, take out of the oven, and voila!) ''

- I can't make up my mind - is it appropriate for this article? Does an encylopedia usually bother to define near-miss misspellings?? [[User:Nevilley|Nevilley]] 08:51 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)

If you're so keen on anagrams, I suggest you hustle your alias up, say as 'Vile Neyl', but do your homework: there is NO French word &quot;voila&quot;, just &quot;voilà&quot;, a contraction of &quot;vois là&quot; ('see there'). 
There! Now back to the play pen: Wikipedia is serious business, and all the grimmer as pseudo-contributors confuse it with a mindless passtime, unfortunatelt wasting every one else's time- surely there are chat rooms if you're desperate for oocpatinal therapy- or maybe you might just have a go at an actual contribution?.

== Vertical Viola ==
I am convinced that it is a mistake to give such prominence to upright violas. In an article about the viola you would expect to read about what 99.9% of violas are like. The upright bit is an interesting aside but should be where it has been moved several times, at or near the bottom of the article. There could be all sorts of other wacky violas too but none of them shoudl be right up near the top - that's just misleading. Nevilley

:Hi Nevilley--I respectfully disagree with you on the issue of whether the [[vertical viola]] is &quot;wacky&quot;.  So would Yo-Yo Ma, who called his encounter with the instrument &quot;an amazing experience&quot;.  But I do agree with you that the vertical viola should not be so prominent in the viola article.  It's particularly annoying that the current version, created by an anonymous editor, isn't even correct; Hutchins invented the vertical viola for purposes of tonal quality, not ease of playing.  I'll fix this soon when it looks like the coast is clear.  [[User:Opus33|Opus33]] 04:01, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Sorry, &quot;wacky&quot; was uncalled-for. I have no doubt it's a lovely instrument and I have the greatest respect for Yo-Yo Ma although I'm not sure what viola players generally would think about cellists poaching their way into the already sorely limited repertoire! But thanks, and yes it does need fixing to give this non-wacky, but rare, atypical and minority-flavoured instrument rather less prominence in the article than it currently enjoys. [[User:Nevilley|Nevilley]] 08:50, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I play the viola (the everyday type that falls under &quot;99.9%). Now no matter how much I stick to the things I know and don't think much of musical varity, &quot;Wacky&quot; was '''not''' OK here.
And I have the greatest respect for Yo-Yo Ma, who is the best cellist the world has ever seen.

== in play the viola ==
and I think that violins suck because they are all so whiney and they look down on us when, more often than not, they are the ones that have the greatest amount of problems with their parts. is it just me, or do the violas seem to be more talented. people always say that it is because our music is easier, but when both instruments get the same part, it is the violin that seems to have more problems.

:Alright, calm down!  Don't take yourself seriously - all us viola players know that we are better than violinists and we just humour them with their little jokes...

== String instrument history ==
What does modern scholarship have to say about Forsyth's ''Orchestration'' claim, that the viola was the first to appear of the modern strings? Is it worth having a section on this anywhere? (There's a section on violin history in [[Violin]] but it makes no connections to the Gamba family or to the Viola d'amore, etc. ...) [[User:Schissel|Schissel]] 13:25, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I think it's more of a folkloric claim than one that has been documented with actual evidence.  Grove specifically refutes it (I'm at work now so can't look it up, I can later).  As far as I know the instruments in the violin family developed concurrently; some early Renaissance paintings show three-string and four-string instruments which are about violin-size, but no instruments survive from before about 1560.  [[User:Antandrus|Antandrus]] 00:26, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Thanks - good to know (''sotto voce'' - *g* sometimes, not the first time, it occurs to me I should check a more recent reference work than his, anyway!) [[User:Schissel|Schissel]] 01:16, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::Here's a bit more.  Probably Forsyth's claim (in an otherwise excellent book) is based on a misunderstanding about the word &quot;viola&quot;.  Before about 1535, &quot;viola&quot; referred generally to ''any'' bowed stringed instrument.  It was modified variously to describe instruments of different families (''viola da braccio'', ''soprano di viola da braccio'', ''viola da gamba'', ''viola d'amore'', etc.)  It did not mean ''specifically'' what we modernly call a viola until about the 18th century.  At any rate all the members of the violin family (now this is from Grove) developed at about the same time, in the first few decades of the 16th century.  (Should this go in the article somewhere?)  Fun stuff.  [[User:Antandrus|Antandrus]] 03:59, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Noren 24

However you slice it and dice it, it does not look, based on that count, like Noren belongs in the same list as the other three, not yet anyway. I would not be happy to see Noren reinstated to the list, in its present form, without some very solid evidence as to why this should be so.

This criteria got me interested.  It seems I have 17,100 Google entries, more than Tabea Zimmermann, which is somehow ridiculous, if this is the primary criterium.  As I am not one of the most-known violists, I would have my doubts about this methodology.  Why is Bruno Giuranna, arguably the most infuential and important violist after Primrose (987,000), not included? Google turns up over 58,000 listings for his name. - James Creitz

I just had a question about violas. I was wondering they can be tuned to violin tuning gdea?
If so is it something commonly done?

:Viola strings are calibrated for a certain tension level.  To try and tune them up a full fifth would be an extraordinary amount of surplus pressure.  I can't see how you would do it without breaking the strings.  I have never heard of any situation where a viola is not tuned to the standard ADGC [[User:Evanbro|Evanbro]] 04:42, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)

:I have. The strings are not generally tuned up (too much tension will break the strings) but there are several compositions, especially music for viola ensembles, that call for the C string to be tuned down, for example, to a G. I suppose other strings could be tuned down as well. But not up. Unless you like broken strings. [[User:Bobhobbit|Bobhobbit]] 22:46, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::That is true, Bobhobbit. Pieces sometimes also call for tuning the G string down a half step, or something like that.

Agreed. I once tried to tune my viola myself. I'm 10. It was a ''big'' mistake. It's hard to play with a broken A string.

I bought some violin strings for my viola, shaved down the bridge to relieve tension on the strings and it sounds fine to me.Although I miss the mellow mood the viola makes. Make sure your strings are long enough or lengthen your tail piece

**The bigger question is why would anyone ever want to spoil the wonderful sound of a viola by tuning it like a violin.  Probably a &quot;converted&quot; violist (one who switched from violin to viola) who misses the violin.  If you are an &quot;original&quot; violist (one who started on the viola) you wouldn't desicrate such a fine instrument.  (lol)  In all seriousness, wouldn't a 5 string viola viola meet your needs better?

Back in the dark ages, when I was 10 (ok not that far), I must have went through about 50 A strings.  Don't give up on trying to tune your viola yourself.  Be sure to have a reliable source for your tuning pitch and always come from below.  Practice matching pitch on the next string down.  The hardest part about tuning once you can here where you need to go, is manipulating the pegs and tuners....debcallico from Utah**  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.10.219.39|12.10.219.39]] ([[User talk:12.10.219.39|talk]]) 00:57, 10 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Section on &quot;Playing the viola&quot; ==

I've [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viola&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12867550 blanked] and [[Viola#Playing the viola|partially rewritten]] the section on '''Playing the viola'''.

This struck me as fairly useless, so I decided to [[WP:Be bold|be bold]] and get rid of the whole section after merging any significant differences to the violin article.

The second paragraph in the introduction seems to be too biased.  It is true that violas are very underrated compared to practically all other string instruments and can have a beautiful sound that is vital for a group's overall sound.  However, calling it the most versatile of string instruments is too easily contended with to be put in a wikipedia article.  Could I get some feedback (no pun intended) on this?  I am primarily a violinist, secondly a violist, so I am biased.  I would appreciate any comments on the second paragraph. [[User:Omnijohn|omnijohn]] 21:32, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

I am primarily a violist and violinist! I am not biast and find extreme pleasure in playing both instruments. I think that as to whether the viola sounds better than the violin is really quite debateable. The viola has a beautiful, mellow sound and full-arm vibrato comes out really well in it. On the other hand, there is a limited supply of viola music and it is primarily a &quot;background&quot; sort of instrument.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Violawow|Violawow]] ([[User talk:Violawow|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Violawow|contribs]]) 08:55, 24 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Differences in bowing: violin &amp; viola ==

02:01, 2 April 2006 Quadalpha ''(revert POV/inaccuracy - a change like this would be better discussed on the talk page first)''

part of the paragraph in question:

: ... right handed technique is quite different. For example, violinists tend to play in the middle-to-upper half of the bow. A violists strongest point in the bow is the lower half, and to create such a somber sound, violists are required to play in this part of the bow. It is a common mistake for violinists who also play viola to not note the differences in bow technique and produce a poorer tone that tends to be light and weak.

The article does mention the extra bow weight needed, and the fact that viola strings speak more slowly than violin strings. It will be useful to mention differences in bow distribution, if they are systematically taught or practiced. Any experts watching this? [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 15:20, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

:Personally, I've never seen a violinist who systematically plays higher in the bow than I would on a viola for similar passages. &quot;A violists strongest point in the bow is the lower half, and to create such a somber sound, ''violists are required to play in this part of the bow.''&quot; - that seems too much of a generalisation, even if it has any basis in fact. --[[User:Quadalpha|Quadalpha]] 01:24, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

Righto.  That part about bow location is bumpkus.  The difference in technics lies in the weight and manipulation of the bow arm.

Since both of these forms of jokes have their own wikipedia pages, and I'm not advocating the creation of a separate &quot;viola joke&quot; page, we can compromise and leave the section here, perhaps changing the redirect on [[viola jokes]] to point to this section instead of to the page on [[joke]]s in general.[[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 23:50, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

===pertinent info for &quot;Jokes&quot; section==

I've just added back two bits of info which were removed from the Jokes section.  While I agree that, if we have it at all, it ought to be as as short as possible, I also hold that, once granted the section, it needs to refer to viola jokes as being more prominent than other instrument jokes (after all, that is the only reason we have this section: otherwise it appears to be a random reference to &quot;instrument jokes&quot; stating that there are instrument jokes -- and that there are viola jokes -- which is redundant and very not-useful information.  If the section itself is unencyclopedic, removing any reference to why it's there in the first place makes it doubly so).

I also put back the reference to &quot;jokes about viola jokes&quot;, which serves to highlight further how prominent/prolific the viola joke is.
[[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 05:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)



Then I say that we remove it; the reason for the &quot;Jokes&quot; section is not to say that there are more viola jokes than other instrument jokes, nor for it &quot;to be a random reference to &quot;instrument jokes&quot; stating that there are instrument jokes -- and that there are viola jokes&quot;, but rather investigating the premise for viola jokes (i.e. the main premise is &quot;that violists are not very good technical musicians&quot;)in the context of the instrument jokes. However, it is most certainly not up to us to say that violas (or indeed any other instrument) are any better or worse than any other instrument/musician, as was the case before there were anyone else editing it (nor is it an option say that one side of any issue is better or worse than another. We must leave the reader to make up their own mind). I must ask the obvious question, and please forgive me for doing so, but in what way was it encyclopedic before? It was not a balanced article.

By saying that violists are the object of fun any more than any other instrument (which they are not- they simply are not well known enough to be the laughing stock*) we are destroying the neutrality of the section, and thus the article. Any biased article is one too many, and this is one section which appears to want to lean to the negitive. If it cannot be neutral, which it certainly was not before the editing, then I say it ought to be deleted, and left at that. 

*(Plus I can give copious amounts of examples of jokes about almost all other mainstream instruments, all individually equalling the number and &quot;bite&quot; of viola jokes.)


:1) please sign your posts, it helps when people want to follow a discussion if they can see when a new person is chiming into a debate.

:2) In response to your post:

:-I meant by &quot;more prominent&quot; that viola jokes are told ''more often'' than other jokes ''within the orchestral or chamber music world'', and '''not''' that they are more numerous, nor that violists are &quot;the laughing stock&quot; of the entire world; for '''you are right''' in saying that they are not well known enough for that.

:-I don't believe the section had a '''particularly''' negative POV before; rather, I thought that removing the reference to the prominence of viola jokes made it ''less truthful'' by leaving out the underlying reason for mentioning the subject.  

:-I hold that the section should not exist at all, OR that it should give the reason why there is a need to mention viola jokes on the viola page '''when there is no need to reference jokes about other instruments on their respective pages'''. 

:3) Given the earlier discussion and consensus about keeping the section, I propose adding the following sentence: 
::&quot;In the music world, particularly in music schools or youth orchestras, the viola joke is often told with more frequency than other instrumental jokes.&quot;

:This would of course be better if I could find some research to back it up, which I recall seeing somewhere, so I will go looking for it before I add it.
:[[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 09:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)


Good luck with looking for it as I do not believe you'll find it, but researching is good. Can never do too much research. Also, your comment &quot;I don't believe the section had a '''particularly''' negative POV&quot; implies that even you believe there '''''was''''' '''some''' bias in the article. 

However, these jokes are not told anymore commonly than any other types of instrument jokes- I have played in many various youth and chamber orchestras for many, many years and I have never even heard an instrument joke told once, let alone a barrage of viola jokes that is suggested both by you (Plural), and in the article, seem to suggest. I have also played in full orchestras, jazz combos, rock mixes and have been in proffesional fierce competition with our rival ensembles and never have we heard a single viola joke. I have asked all of my peers and my former teachers and my conductor. None of them have ever heard of a many of instrument jokes, much less an insurmountable majority of viola jokes. 

While it may not have been the ''intention'' to suggest that violas are the laughing stock of the musical world and they are inferior, it was certainly the implication and as such I maintain that the article is a freely biased form of prejudice, and as such should be removed. The idea that simply because the whole viola article has a “viola jokes section”, the viola must be inferior is deeply flawed; it takes one person to add such a section, and as such doesn’t mean that it is the “truth”.  Also, since the viola joke is not any more prominent than any other instrument joke, saying (or rather, Speculating, perhaps?) that they are adding to the lessening the truth/ making the article “less truthful”, as you put it.

Also, the fact that there ''are'' '''so many''' jokes (and I don't mean viola jokes) implies that they would be told equally, if at all. 

My very, very strong recommendation is that we remove the article, and I don’t think that anyone else will add it back again; the viola article did just fine without it before about May this year. Sunday, July 30

:Me again.  I found that bit of &quot;research&quot; I referred to.  [http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/jcb/viola-presentation.html] After re-reading it, it seems less methodical of a 'study' than I remembered it being.  However it does provide a basis for the claim that viola jokes were more prominent than other types of jokes in the recent past, and it does cite evidence for their prominence from various major and international newspaper articles &amp; columns, at least one well-known humorist's book, as well as from the authors' own original research. Having found this I now propose an ammendment to my previously proposed statment: 

:&quot;In the recent past, there is evidence (mostly anecdotal) that the viola joke rose in popularity above other instrumental jokes, and although it may have since declined, the &quot;infamy&quot; gained from this joke cycle by the viola and by violists can still be felt in some situations (Rahkonen, Carl, 1994).&quot; [[User:J Lorraine|J Lorraine]] 08:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

I maintain that we remove the section. You are right in that it is not really a study, but after researching it, it is clear that this a poorly studied and written, heavily personalized and biased text that is not well constructed. The author takes the quotes the people meant to be “proving” his point out of context, and misuses information when there is simply not really much evidence in the generalizations with which he provides the reader. Plus, it is not really right to have an “encyclopaedic” article based on only a single resource, much less one which is as poorly edited as this one. Therefore, this article simply is not a suitable for the basis of a Wikipedia article or section. This article is based on Rahkonen’s pov, rather than well-researched work. We can’t in good faith base the section on only one source. 

And, a collection of 50 viola jokes is actually '''''less''''' than the number of any of the jokes that I have found about '''''any''''' of the instruments. 

Also, having 1 article in a newspaper with viola jokes proves nothing- I have seen numerous articles on other instruments, and jokes just about people because they play '''''an''''' instrument- any instrument.

Even if we take his points as true, he states that the peak was in 1993,and then was &quot;greatly diminished&quot; by 1994-12 years ago!! They should be well and truely dead by now. It seems a bit pointless to me having a section about a brief flare-up. 

I could also launch into a 12 page analysis of the weaknesses of the practice of using only one resource and using his article for this article, but I'm sure you see the weaknessess too.
 
I say that we remove the jokes section.

:regarding the discussion here, I don't think the jokes section was actually based on that article.  Rather, I got the impression that whoever created the section was basing it on what they thought was &quot;common knowledge&quot; in the viola-related music world.  Most of the viola article seems to be full of such &quot;common knowledge&quot; information.  I'm not saying we shouldn't find sources for certain things, especially if they are disputed, but that most people (except you) seemed to accept the idea that there is something notable about viola jokes which makes people consider placing a section on them in this article (see previous &quot;joke&quot; related discussions here).  I only brought up the article because I recalled reading a paper about the prominence of viola jokes, so I thought I'd go look it up.  My own experience as a musician and a violist, along with the experiences of other musicians I have spoken to, who hail from places all over the globe, leads me to believe that viola jokes are told more frequently than other kinds of musican jokes -- and that they are told more frequently in almost every music school, conservatory, orchestra (be it youth, community, or professional), and classical music festival or institute the world over.  Therefore, I assumed that, since I saw no other notable feature in viola jokes, this prominence was the very thing which caused people to want to place a section on viola jokes in this article, when no such jokes section has been brought up in connection to other orchestral string instrument's articles.  I maintain that merely stating that viola jokes are told with more frequency than other musician jokes is not in itself a negative point of view (it is merely a description of what happens).  I maintain that if the section is kept (which  is a position I have never wholeheartedly supported), it must refer to this prominence -- otherwise, by leaving out the only possible reason for mentioning the jokes, it becomes at best a very silly section which may leave readers wondering why it is there, and at worst a rather biased section which gives readers the impression that some Wikipedia editor thinks viola jokes themselves are somehow worthy of being described because of their great wit, charm, originality, and intellectual appeal.

I'm sorry but your last sentence makes no sense and should be broken up into 2 pieces. However, as I have previously stated I have '''never''' heard a viola joke be told, and it would be ridiculous to say that the people that I have met and asked, both in the musical and general community, have all been &quot;mysteriously isolated from viola jokes&quot;.


This (at the very least) equals and cancels out your assertion that you have met so many &quot;viola joke specialists&quot;, and I have worked and/or studied in all of the institutions that you have mentioned and never one instrument joke has been uttered, much less a viola joke. 

Also, I am clearly not the only person to be aware of the weaknessess of this wikipedia article. There were at least 2 others that saw the bias of the section, and clearly voiced their own outrage(this does not imply that my reaction is ooutrage, but that they were very angry about it), and as we know, not a great number of people can either actually A)Know how to edit an article B) Know how to leave a &quot;talk&quot; message, so your claim (which is verging on rude, so be careful to keep civil &quot;: P&quot;) that &quot;people, except [me]&quot; &quot;have no problem with it&quot;, is downright wrong. I daresay that the people that left those messages are also likely represent a large number of people that see the bias. 

As few people are likely to research their own instrument, the violists are unlikely to read the article, so the people that would best to edit and write about the viola (i.e. violists) would not actually be the ones to write the article, so we are left with people that, by majority are most likely not primarily violists.

The entire (according to your argument) basis of the article is &quot;common knowledge&quot;. However, as we have established, those which you have (apparently) heard are, at a minimum, negated by mine, and my experiences (you can only compare individual experiences with one another- you can't have 2 or more compared to only one person) it is not common knowledge. How can it be &quot;common knowledge&quot; if, forgive me, the &quot;knowledge&quot; is not &quot;common&quot;. This section is based not fact but rather a misconception at best. 

Also if we take that man's 1994 article as true, they were (perhaps)popular in c. 1992-3. this is certainly no reason for having an article on it 12+ years later.  

You previously said that the article that you referred to from the mit site &quot;does provide a basis for the claim that viola jokes were more prominent than other types of jokes in the recent past, and it does cite evidence for their prominence from various major and international newspaper articles &amp; columns, at least one well-known humorist's book, as well as from the authors' own original research&quot;.You also said that there was &quot;mostly anecdotal&quot; evidence. However, after I &quot;poked holes&quot; in this poorly written article, you now say that it is &quot;common knowledge&quot;. I'm sorry, but one '''''cannot''''' go from saying that there is merely &quot;mostly anecdotal&quot; evidence to the suppossed prominence of viola jokes being some thing that &quot;everyone knows&quot; and that is &quot;common knowledge&quot;, as you said. I have managed to debunk most of the pro viola-joke arguments so far and, as it is, it looks like I will be able to continue to do so. It seems, with due dignity, that the relavence for the jokes section of this article is fading and the supposed reasons for the section are holding on for dear life.

If, as you suggest, the viola joke section is based on the idea that they are more prominant than other jokes, and that this was the reason for the section, then it should most certainly be deleted. Thursday, August 3, 2006.

== POV II ==

''In fact, if someone says that a violist is less competent than any other musician, they are only repeating a centuries old '''myth'''. In fact, one could tell them to &quot;get with the times&quot;, rather than just telling each other old instument jokes.''

This paragraph looked awfully defensive to violists, so I removed it.

== Bow length ==

Because the sounding point is further from the body, less bow length is useful to a viola player of average build. In other words, any given player will use less length of bow on a viola than a violin, so bows are built accordingly. All the full-size bows I can get my hands on at the moment confirm this, as well as Strobel's ''Useful Measurements for Violin Makers.'' __ [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 16:18, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

* Viola bows have the same size as violin bows...
::The Strobel reference hasn't changed, but I was just holding two &quot;full-sized&quot; bows, and the viola bow is a solid cm longer than the violin bow. The viola frog is a bit more massive than the violin one, about 0,6 mm wider at it's widest face, by the shell slide. Not sure what to do with this info...  [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 16:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

Better to leave length out of it. More variable than violin bows, some viola bows are longer, some shorter. Cello bows and French style bass bows are ''shorter'' than viola bows.

I'm coming into this discussion late, but I believe I wrote the first version of the now-deleted jokes section, last year sometime (it was very short when I wrote it) and I think its loss is a real one.  I play and love the viola, and certainly wouldn't want to give the jokes too much emphasis.  The section should be short and down towards the bottom of the article.  But lore is a category of knowledge, and viola jokes are a real phenomenon, which people interested in the viola might well be want to know about.  Deleting the section seems like insecurity, not a way to improve knowledge.  I won't add it back in again, because that would an &quot;edit war,&quot; but I strongly think that Wikipedia should be about giving people more, not less, information. [[User:Mschlanger|Mschlanger]] 18:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

**Perhaps the jokes could be their own article.  My viola teacher has shared many a viola joke with me.  I can surely relate to the one:  How do you get a violist to play down bow spiccato?  Write &quot;solo&quot; above a whole note.  That was me to a &quot;T&quot; (and sometimes it still is).  I also like the musician joke: definition of a string quartet:  a good violinist, a bad violinist, an ex-violinist, and someone who hates violins.

== Sound of Viola Ambiguity ==

In the second paragraph, the sentence &quot;However, the viola's timbre sets it apart: its rich sonority is more full-bodied than the violin's, dark-toned and earthy.&quot; is a little unclear. It's a little confusing whether the Violin's sound is dark-toned and earthy or if it continues describing the Viola. I'm editing it so that it says &quot;than the violin's dark-toned, earthy sound&quot; for better readability.

It's rather a nitpick, I won't be offended if it's changed back or made into something better. It may be a minor edit, but I'm afraid that the sentence does mean 'viola's dark-toned and earthy'. I just want it to be reviewed to make sure it's correct. [[User:FrankieVA|FrankieVA]] 22:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
:Yup, it's supposed to mean that. The viola sound is darker-toned and earthier than a violin's, at least the way I hear it. __[[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 04:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:P.S. It's not just a matter of range or ''[[tessitura]].'' The same phrase on the G, D and A strings of either instrument will sound more full-bodied (talking about &quot;body&quot; in the sense of a singer's instrument here) on the viola, yes? [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]]

== List of &quot;well-known&quot; players. ==

I have pruned this list. Many of the names appeared to be there either because they were someone's favourite player, or the editor thought that if they deserved a page in Wikipedia, then they must deserve a mention in the list too. As a result it was becoming ludicrously long, as such lists have a tendency to do.

The important words here are &quot;well-known&quot;. This does have the advantage of being amenable to the objective test of a simple google search of &quot;+&lt;name&gt; +viola&quot;. Sorry if anyone thinks that's too crude and unmusical, but it's relative notability that is at issue here, not musicianship.

== Electric viola section: [[WP:CB]]? ==

No way to put this gently, but the first paragraph of the electric viola section as it now stands is a load of [[WP:CB|um, nonsense]]. While electric violas do exist, they are rare, usually custom built, and '''not''' the same size as a violin. John Jordan, Ned Steinberger, Jensen, or someone like that will build you an e-viola, either to &quot;standard&quot; dimensions, a 16.5&quot; viola for example, or to your own specification. Instruments exist with the scale length of a violin, with strings going down to C, F, or B flat, and they are called &quot;violins,&quot; &quot;e-violins,&quot; or &quot;electric violins.&quot;

I'm thinking of deleting this section entirely. __[[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] 15:36, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

:I agree - the stuff about violin-sized so-called electric violas is just plain wrong. To quote from www.zetamusic.com ....

== Fractional violin strung as viola ==

I notice there is a fact tag from Feb '08 on this sentence: &quot;Often, a fractional-sized violin will be strung with the strings of a viola (C, G, D and A) for those children who need even smaller sizes.&quot;

I don't think we should be too hasty to lose this sentence. It is an indisputable fact. When I was helping maintain a rental fleet, that's exactly how we &quot;created&quot; violas in smaller sizes. The smallest true viola I've seen has a 12&quot; body. In some cases, I've seen a similar job done with a half-size violin strung as a viola. I have no clue where to find a reference to cite for this; who bothers to write this kind of stuff down, anyway? __[[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] ([[User talk:Just plain Bill|talk]]) 03:31, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

---Hi, I'm not sure if editing the last post is how you add your opinion (I'm new, so feel free to correct my mistake), but I agree 100% with this statement.

I apologize profusely for resurrecting a dead issue, but I do believe a mention somewhere within the article about viola jokes and their nature based on my personal experience.

There is, for lack of a better description, a comical pretend quasi-stigma against violists.

== In Popular Music ==

The section about the viola in popular music seems a little amateurish. Firstly the mention of the 'avant garde' as commensurate with pop music. Pop music is, by definition, not avant garde. In fact the 'avant garde' article that it links to makes no mention of popular music in the 'music' section. This could easily be rectified.

The other thing that jars is this statement: &quot;It is quite unusual though, to use individual string instruments in contemporary popular music.&quot; This seems to fly in the face of the fact that the guitar is by far the most popular instrument in pop music, followed, probably, by the piano. Both string instruments. This could very easily be improved, but when I tried to make an edit I was told it was corrected automatically. &quot;ClueBot NG makes very few mistakes&quot;, it says.

:Thanks for that. And I think of the piano as a percussion instrument, too. There are other querulous parts such as &quot;It is usually the flute or rather the full orchestra appearing to be the favoured choice&quot;. Since when was the flute 'usually' the 'favoured choice' of pop music? Seems spurious. And upper strings being 'drowned out' must surely have been solved since the advent of amplification. I seem to recall string sections constantly hanging around Top of the Pops, particularly with balladeers. But I think I'll just walk away. All ze best.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mr Big Eichelhäher|Mr Big Eichelhäher]] ([[User talk:Mr Big Eichelhäher|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mr Big Eichelhäher|contribs]]) 11:55, 23 October 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::I just clear-cut the last sentence with the &quot;favoured choice&quot; and &quot;drowned out&quot; malarkey in it. Not sure what to do with the ''avant-garde'' bit. __ [[User:Just plain Bill|Just plain Bill]] ([[User talk:Just plain Bill|talk]]) 15:24, 23 October 2014 (UTC)
