== POV ==
This article is written from a purely English perspective, even though it describes someone whose career was largely in Ireland. The opening sentence, that he was &quot;an English statesman&quot; is highly partisan; &quot;statesman&quot; is not a term that would be applied by an Irish person to someone responsible for what the article later euphemistically labels as &quot;pursued aggressive policies&quot;. His massacre of the survivors of the Armada gives a hint of what those &quot;aggressive policies&quot; might have amounted to.

The process of military colonisation which he oversaw should be described in less euphemistic terms. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996600&quot;&gt;Brown&lt;/span&gt;HairedGirl]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] â€¢ ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:32, 9 April 2008 (UTC)
