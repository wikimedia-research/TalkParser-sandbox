== Ammendment re Deptuty Chief Constables ==

The article as it relates to the number of Deputy Chief Constables is now incorrect and would benefit from being amended.  As part of the move to a single Police Service of Scotland 1 Chief Constable, 4 x Deputy Chief Constables and 6 x Assistant Chief Constables - see http://www.strathclyde.police.uk/whats_happening/news/2012/november/deputy-chief-constables-appointed-police-scotland/  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/72.27.120.126|72.27.120.126]] ([[User talk:72.27.120.126|talk]]) 14:29, 1 February 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
