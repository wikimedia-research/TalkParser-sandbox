Links to Mulhorandi gods incorrect.

The Lady of Pain's status is uncertain (at least for Planescape canon) but she(it?) should not be considered a power (that is, goddess)

Should this page mention that some of the FR gods are pulled from Real World mythology?  [[User:FrozenPurpleCube|FrozenPurpleCube]] 20:53, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

There is also mentioned in the AD&amp;D 2nd edition book On Hallowed Ground(on page 182), another figure like the Lord Ao named Aoskar. He was destoryed by the Lady of Pain, and had dominion over portals.

Also, on page 30 of Faiths &amp; Avatars Ao is listed to have a superior who is A Luminous Being.

== Lurue ==

I dont know if i am doing this correct, but this article lists lurue as a demideity, while her own article lists her as lesser OR minor, which is hard to understand... which one is now correct?[[User:84.160.74.159|84.160.74.159]] 19:10, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Preparation for major revamp ==

I'm getting ready to take a pause from more serious topics and systematically improve the Forgotten Realms content, most of which is entirely based on 2e material at this time.

Can anyone confirm, in either 2e or 3e content, a source that confirms any of the following as actually being ''Forgotten Realms'' deities (rather than Greyhawk or &quot;generic&quot;)?

Bargrivyek - &lt;strike&gt;Cult of the Singing Skull&lt;/strike&gt; - &lt;s&gt;Eadro&lt;/s&gt; - Gaknulak - &lt;s&gt;Gorellik&lt;/s&gt; - Grankhul - Gzemnid - &lt;s&gt;Jazirian&lt;/s&gt; - Koriel - Maanzecorian - Meriadar - Nomog-Gaeya - Persana - Psilofyr - Quorlinn - Ramenos - Remnis - Skiggaret - Stalker - Surminare - Syranita - &lt;strike&gt;The Bright Sword&lt;/strike&gt; - The Dark God - &lt;strike&gt;The Great Wise Worm&lt;/strike&gt;

Or any of the deities listed as Faerie deities or &quot;The Dark Deities&quot;? [[User:Serpent's Choice|Serpent&amp;#39;s Choice]] 09:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

: Cult of the Singing Skull, The Bright Sword and Elrem the Wise Great Worm are all in the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' for AD&amp;D2ed, under &quot;Beast Cults&quot;, page 60. -- [[User:Trixt|Trixt]] 23:55, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Thanks Trixt!  Totally missed those references.  The Beast Cults in general will need to be added.  In addition to those, there are more from The Horde, and a couple to squeeze in from Malatra.  I'm torn about where to present them, however.  Technically, a beast cult isn't a deity, nor a totem of a deity (like the Uthgardt totems and the Ulutiu ones that I still can't find a cite for...).  I'm leaning towards putting the Beast Cults under nondeity powers.  Thoughts?  [[User:Serpent's Choice|Serpent&amp;#39;s Choice]] 04:39, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

::: IMHO it is correct put them in a sub-section under Quasi-deities powers, because (from FRCS AD&amp;D2ed): &quot;Also included '''in the ranks of the quasi-powers''' are the various powerful creatures, monsters, and godly beings revered by the Beast Cults.&quot; -- [[User:Trixt|Trixt]] 03:04, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Kudos to [[User:Serpent's Choice|Serpent&amp;#39;s Choice]] ==
It's awe-inspiring to see a rewrite on this scale, especially since copious references were added to support the whole thing. Ergo, kudos! --[[User:Agamemnon2|Agamemnon2]] 14:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks!  I'm working to track down documentation of the various things I cut, to make sure they really don't belong in Realmspace.  Right now I'm trying to find a copy of ''Jungles of Chult'' since the Khurgorbaeyag article seems to imply there is content there that ties that deity to the Realms.  If I can cull through all the Realms sources to my satisfaction, I'll be adding in some explanatory text and pushing for FL status.

== Lolth back to into the abyss were she belongs!! ==

I noticed that some fool put Lolth as a greater god. which is completely wrong, she doesnt have nearly as many followers to be  greater... According to D&amp;D 3.5 she is an intermediate god and as far as i believe, she's been that from the beginning.

There are though many gods that are still not mentioned that are not FR specific. only D&amp;D in general. But perhaps those are not worth mentioned on this article.
I really don't know.

Also, as for the Dead Unther gods. as i wrote [[Inanna]] is the original name of the Babylonian Goddess Ishtar, that often is associated with the egyptian goddess Isis, although they are two completetely different gods from two completely different cultures. We Northern barbarians really mix things up once in a while ;P

== Significant Updates Needed, Concerning 4th Edition ==

As of the launch of the Forgotten Realms 4E campain setting, a lot of significant changes have occurred concerning the deities and faiths. A lot of species-specific deities have been retconned as manifestations of other deities, e.g. Yondalla was actually Chauntea all along, Talos was actually Gruumsh, etc. Other powers have been reduced to &quot;Exarch&quot; status, which is basically a demigod who generally serves a greater or lesser deity. Some gods are dead (Tyr, Mystra, Azuth, Helm, pretty much the whole drow pantheon other than Lolth). Asmodeus is also now a Greater Power, in addition to Archduke of the Nine Hells.[[User:ChipEverwood|ChipEverwood]] ([[User talk:ChipEverwood|talk]]) 16:58, 17 November 2008 (UTC)

== A proposal ==
As an effort has been launched to systematically delete articles linked from this list and turned into redirects, I propose this policy be taken to its logical conclusion. The systematic deletion of every single D&amp;D deity article linked to from this list and every single list like it. After that, delete the lists, for the exact same reason. Deities from the D&amp;D game do not, in fact, possess any real-world notability. After this has been accomplished, start mass deletions of D&amp;D content, there must be hundreds of undeserving pages on Wikipedia, detailing non-notable books, creatures, people and characters linked in some way to the D&amp;D game. If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing right. --[[User:Agamemnon2|Agamemnon2]] ([[User talk:Agamemnon2|talk]]) 17:48, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

:::The [[WP:Notability (fiction)|rules]] seem to indicate just what [[User:Agamemnon2|Agamemnon2]] wrote in the first paragraph. Possible reactions in my opinion:
:::1) Ignore the rules. I think this has been done in the past an no longer works, as more wikipedians have taken an interest in applying them to D&amp;D articles.
:::2) Trying to keep articles in accordance with the rules. This would mainly mean finding [[WP:Reliable Sources|third-party sources]]. For most articles I have only faint hope here - except on published books, where we might be able to find reviews in gaming magazines.
:::3) Change the rules of [[WP:Notability]] and [[WP:Notability (fiction)]] - at least with regard to role-playing games. I would like that, because I agree with [[Special:Contributions/83.253.157.100|83.253.157.100]], but I only have faint hope here as well.
:::4) Move articles to the appropriate wikia (e. g. [http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Forgotten Realms Wiki] or [http://dnd.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page D&amp;D Wiki]). If we do this, I think we should ask, if e. g. this list can be kept in accordance with the rules and then do what [[User:Craw-daddy]] did - but only after discussing if the article is really non-notable.

== Merge with [[Agathos Daimon (Forgotten Realms)]] ==

The [[Agathos Daimon (Forgotten Realms)]] article does not present sufficient information to stand on its own, nor is it notable enough to have its own article.  It should be merged into this list. [[User:Neelix|Neelix]] ([[User talk:Neelix|talk]]) 11:41, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Additionally, Eilistraee was never killed. Per cannon layed out in the Avatar series, A God must be killed in their own plane (AO casts the Gods to the prime material plane so they can die there). Eilistraee was slew in the realms, not in her plane. Secondly, when Mystra, Bane, and Torm each died they produced massive explosions, which didn't occur when Eilistaee died. Lastly, I have contacted the author of the book (I own eilistraee.org, so she replied) and she stated that she didn't want to kill Eilistraee. I submit that Eilistraee was gravely wounded but is not protected by her father until she may rise again.--[[User:Lotus253|Lotus253]] ([[User talk:Lotus253|talk]]) 01:22, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;Bane&quot; deserves own page (again) ==

If the newcomer/late deity Cyric has his own page; the quintessential dark god Bane, who is the archetype and typifies supernatural villain god in rpg setting and has for years; likely has all sorts of popular culture influences that are hard to spot or source but if could be collected and sourced would be gold for a wikipedia article. Bane, of all the D&amp;D gods here which have their own article, is the most surprising not to have one. Someone set out on this venture of making a notable page for Bane that won't get axed. Thanks!

***Now the key question is why.  Again, I'm largely going to have to bag on any meaningful discussion as I'm not a Realms guy, but I am seeing a lot of sources, mostly primary, in the handful of articles I've looked at.  I think it might be worthwhile A) posting something at the D&amp;D wikiproject and B) proposing one or two for merger at a time and give people a few days (maybe a week) to work on them.  We're in no real rush (these articles have been here forever) so may as well work to improve them first.  Also, this list article will likely need to break into at least 2 articles, and maybe 3 or 4 if a real merge (rather than a redirect) is going to happen. That probably could use some discussion too.

*I've not looked at all the articles in question, but enough to say I'm okay with the revised merge list.  [[User:Hobit|Hobit]] ([[User talk:Hobit|talk]]) 14:10, 8 October 2010 (UTC)
::I think that, at minimum, Bane, Bhaal, and Cyric have played pretty important roles in other media (novels, computer games, etc) that they should be considered to be possibly removed from the merge list. I'm less sure about the others. [[Special:Contributions/204.153.84.10|204.153.84.10]] ([[User talk:204.153.84.10|talk]]) 15:11, 8 October 2010 (UTC)
:::I have completed the merge for all the individual deity articles that have not been contested. I have also taken a second look for reliable secondary sources for Bane, Bhaal, and Cyric, but I haven't come up with enough for either of them to demonstrate their individual notability. Unless someone else can find sufficient secondary sourcing for these three deities, their articles should be merged here as well.

::::I'm sure a case could be made for an exception for those three - they are the main villains for notable other media, for which independent sources undoubtedly exist. The places you are looking for sources may be limited in scope, and may not include offline sources.

:::::Google Books, Google News, and Google Scholar searches are fairly comprehensive in their scope and are normally the searches used to determine if a subject meets Wikipedia's notability criteria. I do not see that there are grounds for stating that sources undoubtedly exist for these three characters. These articles have been around for six years and no one seems to have been able to turn up sufficient reliable secondary sources in all that time.

::::::You don't seem to have support on redirecting the last three. I see some people saying that they are fine with merging some, but not all. If you can get some support on redirecting the last three, then that may be OK. [[Special:Contributions/64.134.164.64|64.134.164.64]] ([[User talk:64.134.164.64|talk]]) 19:18, 24 October 2010 (UTC)
