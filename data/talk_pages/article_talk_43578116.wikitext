== WikiProject Good Articles Recruitment Centre ==

{|{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/Shell|introduction=Hello! Now, some of you might have already received a similar message a little while ago regarding the Recruitment Centre, so if you have, there is no need to read the rest of this. This message is directed to users who have reviewed between 12-14 Good article nominations and '''are not''' part of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles|WikiProject Good articles]] (the initial messages I sent out went to only WikiProject members and users that had over 15 reviews).

So for those who haven't heard about the Recruitment Centre yet, you may be wondering why there is a Good article icon with a bunch of stars around it (to the right). The answer? WikiProject Good articles will be launching a Recruitment Centre very soon! The centre will allow all users to be taught how to review Good article nominations by experts just like you! However, in order for the Recruitment Centre to open in the first place, we need some volunteers:

*'''Recruiters:''' The main task of a recruiter is to teach users that have never reviewed a Good article nomination how to review one. To become a recruiter, all you have to do is meet [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/Recruiter Central#Becoming a Recruiter|this criteria]]. Now, one of the most important criteria is that you have at least 15 independent reviews. If you are reading this, you are likely 3 (or less) reviews short, so if you review another couple nominations, you can become a recruiter! If interested, make sure you meet the criteria, read [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/Recruiter Central#The Process|the process]] and add your name to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/List of Recruiters|list of recruiters]]. (One of the great things about being a recruiter is that there is no set requirement of what must be taught and when. Instead, all the content found in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/Recruiter Central#The Process|process section]] is a guideline of the main points that should be addressed during a recruitment session...you can also take an entire different approach if you wish!) If you think you will not have the time to recruit any users at this time but are still interested in becoming a recruiter, you can still add your name to the list of recruiters but just fill in the &quot;Status&quot; parameter with &quot;Not Available&quot;.

''NOTE:'' If you are interested in becoming a recruiter but do not meet the 15 review requirement, you can still add your name to the list of recruiters and put your status as &quot;Not Available&quot; until you have reviewed enough nominations.

*'' '''Nominators, please read this:''' '' If you are not interested in becoming a recruiter, you can still help. In some cases a nominator may have an issue with an &quot;inexperienced&quot; editor (the recruitee) reviewing one of their nominations. To minimize the chances of this happening, if you are fine with a recruitee reviewing one of your nominations under the supervision of the recruiter, please add your name to the list at the bottom of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Recruitment Centre/Recruiter Central#Nominators That Are OK With A Recruitee Reviewing|this page]]. By adding your name to this list, chances are that your nomination will be reviewed more quickly as the recruitee will be asked to choose a nomination from the list of nominators that are OK with them reviewing the article.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to [[User talk:Dom497|contact me]]. I look forward to seeing this program bring new reviewers to the Good article community and all the positive things it will bring along.

''A message will be sent out to all recruiters regarding the date when the Recruitment Centre will open when it is determined. The message will also contain some further details to clarify things that may be a bit confusing.''--[[User:Dom497|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#1F75FE&quot;&gt;'''Dom497'''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Dom497|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00308F&quot;&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/span&gt;)]]

== Metalloid ==

I noticed all your recent edits to the article on [[Metalloid]]. Because I know they were all done in a sincere effort to improve the article, and because you have been editing in Wikipedia for a while, I will not undo them all in one wholesale revert. However, in the future, your fellow editors would appreciate it if you would make just a few edits at a time, then save them before proceeding to the next section. This way, if another editor feels that one or two edits need to be undone, this can be done without undoing all the rest. I'm not going to change any of your edits; I'm leaving the reviewing to another editor. Best regards, [[User:CorinneSD|CorinneSD]] ([[User talk:CorinneSD|talk]]) 23:58, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

==Disambiguation link notification for May 4==

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited [[Fluorine]], you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page [[Paraffin]] ([[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dablinks.py/Fluorine|check to confirm]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py/Fluorine|fix with Dab solver]]). Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of &quot;Did you mean...&quot; article titles. &lt;small&gt;Read the [[User:DPL bot/Dablink notification FAQ|FAQ]]{{*}} Join us at the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|DPL WikiProject]].&lt;/small&gt;

It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these [[User:DPL bot|opt-out instructions]]. Thanks, [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] ([[User talk:DPL bot|talk]]) 08:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Elements&amp;diff=618339475&amp;oldid=618329660 This] edit re editor Double sharp may be crossing a line. &quot;I know where you're coming from&quot; can be read as a threat, and as a non-constructive attitude. Of course I could misunderstand you (recently I wrote about the angle of your writing, re me), but maybe that's another reason to change the tone of your music. On a minor level, but just a bit minor and still seriously, I note that you are talking for another editor (Nergaal). AFAIK, that editor is fully able to talk &amp; sign themselves. -[[User:DePiep|DePiep]] ([[User talk:DePiep|talk]]) 23:44, 24 July 2014 (UTC)

== Come on, don't hurry, FAC is not a very fast procedure ==

But an FAC is also not a process which will be forgotten for too long (now you certainly know FAC coordinators exist). We should be able to make it.--[[User:R8R Gtrs|R8R]] ([[User talk:R8R Gtrs#top|talk]]) 01:06, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|R8R Gtrs}} there have been no promotions or archivals in the last 3 days. An empirical observation from me – are they having a break or what? [[User:Parcly Taxel|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#230F38;&quot;&gt;Parcly&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Parcly Taxel|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5C2594;&quot;&gt;Taxel&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:13, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
::No worries. Three days isn't a too long period. A week, yes, that would be different. But there are only three coordinators, and Wikipedia is not their full-time job they get money for, and they may be having issues IRL, or they may want to make a short rest for a few days, or anything. Be slightly more patient. Three days more, three days less. That's not too bad. Again, a week, yes, that's when you should be conspicuous. But I'll tell you what, a FAC lasting a month is okay. I am slightly surprised we possibly can finish earlier.--[[User:R8R Gtrs|R8R]] ([[User talk:R8R Gtrs#top|talk]]) 01:27, 26 July 2014 (UTC)

== When you get a chance... ==

I've been intermittently following some of the discussions at WPELEM, and was glad to see that you returned. Formalities aside, whenever you get a chance, would you be willing to perform a GA review for [[Serpens]], which has now been stuck at GAN for over a month? I would greatly appreciate it, but if you don't want to, that's fine too.
