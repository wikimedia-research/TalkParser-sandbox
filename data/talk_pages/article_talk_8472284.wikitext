== nuts ==

I hear nuts are actually healthy. Yet in this book Rabbit is not allowed to eat nuts because of their cholesterol content. Was that a misguided belief at the time of publication, or is it actually true? [[User:Zigzig20s|Zigzig20s]] 12:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;MI&quot; ==

Does anyone know why the final chapter of this series is titled &quot;MI&quot;?  

After some more searching I found the answer; it stands for &quot;Myocardial Infarction&quot;. This is clever as the three chapters are titled &quot;FL&quot; which takes place in Florida, &quot;PA&quot; which takes place in Pennsylvania, and &quot;MI&quot; which does not take place in Michigan.

:Ah, that's clever if it's right! The only rationale I could come up with was that, after losing the Toyota franchise, the state of Michigan (home of Detroit) would figure to play a much larger role in the future of Springer Motors.
