== Line Diagram ==

Hey Sushiya, first off, thanks for putting the proper infobox up. However I also noticed that you deleted the line diagram because it didn't &quot;add much information to station list&quot;. It's true that it's a pretty boring and simplistic line diagram (a straight shot from beginning to end), but the whole point of those boxes are to give an easy-to-understand overview of the makeup of the line. And in this case, not having much information is exactly the information it's supposed to convey.

Anyway, I added the diagram back but used the 'hide' tag so it doesn't get in the way. Hopefully you'll find that a suitable compromise.

I've been planning to start writing English-language articles for the many abandoned rail lines in Hokkaido, but as I haven't gotten around to it yet, I'm happy to see someone else doing so. :)   [[User:Purplepumpkins|purplepumpkins]] ([[User talk:Purplepumpkins|talk]]) 13:32, 18 September 2011 (UTC)
