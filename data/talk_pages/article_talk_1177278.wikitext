== Unable to disambiguate Westbury ==

The article contains the statement:

:The quarrel appears to date from [[1288]] when the monks considered that the rights of the church of Worcester had been infringed by the bishop's refusal to allow their precentor to summon those who were to be ordained at an ordination at [[Westbury]].

Unfortunately there are at least three places in England called Westbury, and no context to determine which one is being referred to here. So the link remains pointing at the dab page. If you know which one is being referred to here, please correct. -- [[User:Chris j wood|Chris j wood]] 22:13, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)
