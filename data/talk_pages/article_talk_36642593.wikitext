[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Theopolisme|Theopolisme]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/220.233.46.108|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made to [[:Hallgr√≠mskirkja]], because it didn't appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Theopolisme|my talk page]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-cluebotwarning1 --&gt;   '''[[User:Theopolisme|&lt;font color=#00B74A&gt;Theopolisme]] '''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_Talk:Theopolisme|&lt;font color=#37DB79&gt; TALK]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 21:52, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
