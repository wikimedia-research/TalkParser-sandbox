[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the encyclopedia, but when you add or change content, as you did to the article [[:Godzilla (2012 film)]], ''please cite a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable source]]'' for the content of your edit. This helps maintain our policy of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability]]. Take a look at [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] for information about how to cite sources and the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced1 --&gt; &lt;b&gt;[[User:RaseaC|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Eras Demi ITC; color:DarkBlue;cursor:help&quot;&gt;raseaC]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:RaseaC|talk to me]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 21:52, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
:''If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''

[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Please do not add [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|unsourced]] or [[Wikipedia:No original research|original content]]. Doing so violates Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability policy]]. If you continue to do so, you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. &lt;!-- Template:uw-unsourced3 --&gt; &lt;b&gt;[[User:RaseaC|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Eras Demi ITC; color:DarkBlue;cursor:help&quot;&gt;raseaC]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:RaseaC|talk to me]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:22, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px]] This is the '''final warning''' you will receive regarding your [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive edits]].  The next time you disrupt Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Godzilla (2012 film)]], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]] without further notice'''. &lt;!-- Template:uw-generic4 --&gt; ''You must provide sources when adding information to WP. The article in question is already poorly sourced and the information you are trying to add is neither sourced nor, in my opinion or that of other editors, relevant to the article. You must refrain from readding the content in question and instead take your concerns to the article's talk page where interested editors will be more than happy to discuss any issues. You are disrupting Wikipedia and must stop.'' &lt;b&gt;[[User:RaseaC|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Eras Demi ITC; color:DarkBlue;cursor:help&quot;&gt;raseaC]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:RaseaC|talk to me]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 21:57, 19 August 2010 (UTC)
