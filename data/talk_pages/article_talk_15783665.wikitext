RE: the Title:'''History of Irish.'''

Is this the history of Irish people, animals, languages or what?
Better a '''History of the Irish Gaelic''' or '''History of the native Irish Language'''.

:It was originally called [[History of the Irish language]] and was only recently moved. I wouldn't object to its being moved back to that name. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 17:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

==Irish version?==
Doesn't this article deserve an Irish language version? Only in Finnish?![[Special:Contributions/86.46.203.59|86.46.203.59]] ([[User talk:86.46.203.59|talk]]) 13:06, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:Of course it deserves one. You just have to write it. +[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 17:36, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
::Well I'm looking at the links to articles in other languages and Irish is there with Finnish, I see a long article on &quot;Stair na Gaeilge&quot;? [[Special:Contributions/109.79.7.59|109.79.7.59]] ([[User talk:109.79.7.59|talk]]) 23:15, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:::The Irish article is brand new. It wasn't there yet when this thread was started. +[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 23:47, 4 February 2010 (UTC)

==Link to LFM==
I've included the short-lived [[Language Freedom Movement]] but it might be placed elsewhere in the article. Compulsion in a republic never made sense, but there were no jobs in opposing it.[[User:Red Hurley|Red Hurley]] ([[User talk:Red Hurley|talk]]) 13:00, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

== Northern Ireland/Six Counties ==

The article could do with more on Irish in this part of the world, rather than just the 26 counties. It has taken a very different trajectory there.--[[User:MacRusgail|MacRusgail]] ([[User talk:MacRusgail|talk]]) 13:42, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

== Early modern history ==

I don't want to go all nationalist here, but this article totally downplays the fact that the Tudor's conquest of Ireland had as one of its main aims the displacement of the Irish language by English. It even states that Elizabeth I encouraged the use of Irish in the Pale, when in fact its use there was something English authorities were pulling their hair out over all through the 16th century! 

Elizabeth's primer, cited here as a sign of her enthusiasm for the language, was no more than a few phrases like, &quot;hello, how are you&quot; to greet Irish visitors to court. And, while the article lists all the books printed to try to spread the  reformation it doesn't mention that the actual Irish-language scholars were busy becoming counter-reformation priests and writing Catholic histories of Ireland like the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], [[Foras Feasa ar Eireann]] and the &quot;Life of Red Hugh O'Donnell&quot;, or that Catholicism became so identified with the Gaelic population that until the 19th century, the word for &quot;Protestant&quot; in Irish was the same as the word for &quot;Englishman&quot;! I'm all for getting away from nationalist over-simplification, but this is just ridiculous. [[User:Jdorney|Jdorney]] ([[User talk:Jdorney|talk]]) 12:34, 28 January 2011 (UTC)
==Title of this article==
Given that the history outlined in this article pertains to Ireland only, would it not be more accurate to give it another title such as '''History of the Irish Language in Ireland'''?[[Special:Contributions/86.158.66.156|86.158.66.156]] ([[User talk:86.158.66.156|talk]]) 18:54, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== Shaw,  Wilde, Yeats ==

Did Shaw, Wilde and Yeats really write in Hiberno-English, as claimed in the article? I find it difficult to believe without a proper citation, especially regarding the first two. [[User:Bazuz|Bazuz]] ([[User talk:Bazuz|talk]]) 22:12, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

== &quot;Primitive&quot; ==

I sincerely suggest to obstain from the rather arrogant term &quot;primitive&quot; for old languages, alleging that modern forms represent a cultural &quot;higher&quot; level. [[User:HJJHolm|HJJHolm]] ([[User talk:HJJHolm|talk]]) 09:48, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
:Like it or not, that's the most common name for the language; see [http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&amp;q=%22primitive+irish%22+language&amp;btnG=&amp;lr= the hits at Google Scholar] and [http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=pgl the SIL documentation for the code &quot;pgl&quot;]. There's no other name in widespread use, nor is it obvious what other adjective to use that could indicate a language older than Old Irish (&quot;Very Old Irish&quot;? &quot;Even Older Irish&quot;?).
