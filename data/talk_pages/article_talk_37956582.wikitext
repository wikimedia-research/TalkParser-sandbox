[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:ESkog|ESkog]]. I wanted to let you know that I removed an external link you added&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Mazda]], because to me it seemed inappropriate for an encyclopedia. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:ESkog|my talk page]], or take a look at our [[Wikipedia:External links|guidelines]] about links. Thanks, [[Category:User talk pages with Uw-spam1 notices|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-spam-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spam1 --&gt;([[User:ESkog|ESkog]])&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:ESkog|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:29, 17 December 2012 (UTC)

&lt;div style=clear: both&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not add inappropriate [[Wikipedia:External links|external links]] to Wikipedia, as you did to [[:Nissan Livina Geniss]] with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Livina_Geniss?diff=528495414 this edit]&lt;/span&gt;. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#LINK|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]], nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate may links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites with which you are affiliated, and links that attract visitors to a web site or promote a product.  See [[Wikipedia:External links|the external links guideline]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam guideline]] for further explanations. Because Wikipedia uses the [[nofollow]] attribute value, its external links are disregarded by most search engines. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it. Thank you.[[Category:User talk pages with Uw-spam2 notices|{{PAGENAME}}]] &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-spam-2 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-spam2 --&gt;([[User:ESkog|ESkog]])&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:ESkog|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:30, 17 December 2012 (UTC)

It is considered [[Wikipedia:Spam|spamming]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#ADVERTISING|Wikipedia is not a vehicle for advertising or promotion]]. Because Wikipedia uses [[nofollow]] tags, additions of links to Wikipedia will not alter search engine rankings.
