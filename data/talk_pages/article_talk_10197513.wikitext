== Weapons ==

I suggest that the weapons be sorted in a list to simplify looking if a certain weapon is used ----([[user:Hardtofindausername|Hardtofindausername}})  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 14:56, 6 April 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Is there much point? Special forces units generally use a wide variety of weapons and generally do not publish a list, so how could we know our list was anywhere close to comprehensive? I would be inclined to go reduce it to a list of types A, B, C &quot;and a variety of other types&quot;[[User:Djapa84|    Djapa Owen]] ([[User talk:Djapa84|talk]]) 15:03, 6 April 2013 (UTC)
