==Recent edit to Chicago Bulls==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Hello. I noticed that you recently made a contribution to the [[Chicago Bulls]] article that seemed to be a test. Your test worked! However, test edits on live articles disrupt Wikipedia and may confuse readers. If you want more practice editing, the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] is the best place to do so. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you!
