Hi, thanks for your message on my talk page. Apologies for the confusion regarding your edit to Land Banking. While you were fixing the comma use, it appears you inadvertently removed a letter from a word. That's what made me undo your edit. Many times, people &quot;playing around&quot; on Wikipedia will do subtle things like that, so when I saw the letter drop, I assumed it was one more of those. Of course, you fixing grammar and punctuation is absolutely welcomed! [[User:Electric Wombat|Electric Wombat]] ([[User talk:Electric Wombat|talk]]) 15:53, 4 October 2013 (UTC)
