==Speedy deletion of [[:Sarah pickett]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Sarah pickett]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about about a person, organization (band, club, company, ''etc.'') or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]] 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Sarah pickett|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:Sarah pickett|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the article or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;b&gt;''' [[User:FlyingToaster|&lt;font color=#0036ff&gt;Flying]]'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User_Talk:FlyingToaster|&lt;font color=#e41a1a&gt;Toaster]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 23:57, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
