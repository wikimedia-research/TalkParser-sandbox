== Rename ==

Assuming the four '''Grade n''' articles don't get merged into [[para-equestrian classification]], they need a better disambiguator. &quot;'''(classification)'''&quot; is totally inadequate, since anything with a numbered grade is a classification, whether it's school years, music exams, horse races, quality of meat, or anything else.
