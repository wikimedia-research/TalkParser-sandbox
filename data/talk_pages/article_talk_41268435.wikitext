===Your edits to [[September 16]]===

Some of your [{{fullurl:September 16|diff=584531636&amp;oldid=578628977}} edits] on the page 
[[September 16]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: The person you added doesn't seem to have a Wikipedia page.
If the page exists, check that you've spelled and capitalized the name the same way as the article, and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you '''''[[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally'''''.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved. '''Please see [[User:Pseudomonas/Guidelines on adding births and deaths|this page]] for help'''. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-PseudoBot1 --&gt; [[User:PseudoBot|PseudoBot]] ([[User talk:PseudoBot|talk]]) 15:21, 4 December 2013 (UTC)
:''If this is a [[Network address translation|shared IP address]], and you did not make the edits, consider [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|creating an account]] for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices.''&lt;!-- Template:Shared IP advice --&gt;
