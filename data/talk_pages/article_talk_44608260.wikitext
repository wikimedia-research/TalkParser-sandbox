==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:HSC Chemistry]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:HSC Chemistry]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Organizations]] for more information. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:HSC Chemistry|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator, or if you have already done so, you can place a request [[WP:RFUD|here]]. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Dewritech|&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:blue; text-shadow:grey 0.4em 0.4em 0.5em; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 1px 3px;&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dewritech&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Dewritech#top|talk]])  15:23, 5 December 2014 (UTC)

Hi, thanks for message. I deleted your article because 
*it did not provide '''[[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|independent verifiable sources]]''' to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the [[Wikipedia:Notability (software)|notability guidelines]]. Nearly all your references were to Wikipedia, not a reliable source, or the company that owns the software, not an independent source. I can't see any claim for notability, such as verifiable sales figures, numbers of purchases or reviews in good third-party sources as defined in the link above.
*it was written in a [[WP:NOTADVERTISING|promotional]] tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. The language is full of weasel words and unverifiable claims. Taking one section, HSC Database Module, unsourced claims presented as fact include: '''''versatile'''... one '''powerful''' search dialog... The module has an '''attractive''' visual apprearance {{sic}}... The data of 1300 species have been updated...'' You also have 11 supposed references to this one short paragraph, which seem intended to jam in as many spam links to the company website as possible.
*You have an obvious [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] when it comes to editing articles about this subject. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that your software is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at [[Wikipedia:Requested articles]] for the article to be created. See also [[Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest]].


If you recreate, please note the following style guides
*Only link to a Wikipedia article at the first occurrence. It's unnecessary to have multiple links, and looks spammy when there are so many links to the company.
*Heading should follow normal capitalisation, not capping every word
*You do not need a new heading for every paragraph. It's poor style and seems intended to highlight the claimed benefits of the software
*The table of versions seems unnecessary detail in a general encyclopaedia. Anyone who really wants to know can go to the company website. If you need to say something about the versions, use prose
