== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Venezuelan nationality law]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Venezuelan nationality law]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''This is not an encyclopaedic article.  Legislation is currently hosted from the original source  at [[s:Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]].  Links to this page should be appropriately be redirected to Wikisource.'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Venezuelan nationality law|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; — [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]&lt;/span&gt;'' 00:36, 3 July 2011 (UTC)
