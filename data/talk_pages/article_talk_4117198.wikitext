This article smells like a copyvio; however, I can find nothing that matches the text on a Google search.  Nevertheless, several entries have been returned for this term.  I figure if we are going to keep [[Catholic Guilt]] (as crappy as it is) we should keep this article (as crappy as it is).  Perhaps somebody can fix it, clean it up, and make it worthwhile.

It's linked to on the main atheism article...although, literally, the word Christian means a follower of/one who is like Christ (assuming there was a Jesus) so if I did everything Jesus said, but did not believe in God (maybe I thought he was misquoted there) perhaps I am a Christian Atheist.
