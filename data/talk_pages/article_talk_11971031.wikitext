==Note==
I can't help but feel that this misses the whole point. Hoss is not a musician in the slightest. This references one battle with Crow set to music, but being a Marker is not about music. I'd appreciate if someone who's a bit better at writing articles and is a Shepard fan cleans this up.

I've made some additions, and might add a section for analysis soon. It's generated a substantial amount of criticism for such a recent play. Also, if anyone can think of a better word than &quot;newfangled&quot; to describe Crow's speech, please do change it. As for the above comment, while I agree the original version under emphasized the violent aspect of the dual, I think music is still meant to be a major part of it, as the characters are constantly referring to the Game in terms of musicians like Jagger, Dylan, Ginger Baker, etc. What does need to be emphasized, and I'll try to do this in the Analysis, is that at bottom its about style and self-image rather than ability.
