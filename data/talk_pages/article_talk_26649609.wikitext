[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to make constructive contributions to Wikipedia, but at least one of your recent edits, such as the one you made to [[:Phi Kappa Phi]], did not appear to be constructive and has been '''automatically [[Help:Reverting|reverted]]''' by [[User:ClueBot|ClueBot]]. 
* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* Cluebot produces very few [[false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot/FalsePositives|report it here]], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.
