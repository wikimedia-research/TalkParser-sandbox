#:: &lt;s&gt;''As of 2010, the church is closed (and has been since 2004) because of structural problems'' This statement will soon be dated.  better you just say that it has been closed since 2004.&lt;/s&gt; {{OK}}

#::&lt;s&gt;''The parish priest is Father Michael Ryan...'' How come, if the church is closed?&lt;/s&gt; {{OK}}
#::: Why shouldn't it have a parish priest?  The parish remains, even if the church is temporarily closed until repairs are carried out. [[User:Bencherlite|Bencherlite]][[User talk:Bencherlite|&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Talk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;]] 14:23, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

#:: &lt;s&gt;''The architect was Giuseppe Rinvolucri, an Italian engineer from Piedmont. He had been a prisoner of war held in Wales, '' Italy was allied to Britain and France in WWI.  Needs explanation of why he was a prisoner of war?&lt;/s&gt; {{OK}}
#::References appear OK, several repeat the information that Rinvolucri was a prisoner of war, but without explanation. I found one oblique reference in a Google search[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Giuseppe+Rinvolucri%22&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;ei=tjW7TMLHKoyOjAfWuuWpDg&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N] to his having been interned or subjected to restrictions in '''WWII''', as many Italians were.  Perhaps this is the source of the confusion?
#::: Well, as [[CADW]] (a high-quality source) [http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=24455 says] he came to Wales as a POW before later settling down, we may be in a &quot;verifiability not truth&quot; issue here.  I can't find anything about why he was a POW, but obviously he can't have been a WWII POW who later settled in Wales, as this is a 1930s design. I'd be surprised if &quot;interned&quot; had been muddled up with &quot;POW&quot;, since the two concepts are very different.

#:::I think it would be better to omit this statement as it is clearly incorrect.

#:::::OK, well, the easiest thing to do is to remove it and see if anything better comes up in the future.  Perhaps if I make it to Amlwch from my end of Anglesey I might find out more.
