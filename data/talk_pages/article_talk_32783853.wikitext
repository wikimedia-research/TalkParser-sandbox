I hope you like the place and decide to stay.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Ayos (Book)]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Ayos (Book)]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Ayos (Book)|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 02:12, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
==Removing Speedy at [[Ayos (Book)]]==
{{#ifeq: no | yes | Hi Sagaciousman11, you recently removed a deletion tag from [[Ayos (Book)]]. Because Wikipedia policy [[WP:CSD|does not allow]] the creator of the page to remove speedy deletion tags, an [[WP:BOT|automated program]] has replaced the tag. Although the deletion proposal may be incorrect, removing the tag is not the correct way for you to contest the deletion, even if you are more experienced than the nominator. Instead, please use the talk page to explain why the page should not be deleted. Remember to be patient, there is no harm in waiting for another experienced user to review the deletion and judge what the right course of action is. As you are involved, and therefore potentially biased, you should refrain from doing this yourself. Thank you,| [[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia, thank you for taking the time to create a page here. It might not have been your intention, but you recently removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from a page you created yourself. Because Wikipedia policy [[WP:CSD|does not allow]] the creator of the page to remove deletion tags, an [[WP:BOT|automated program]] has replaced the deletion tag you removed from [[Ayos (Book)]]. Please do not continue to remove the deletion tag, instead, if you disagree with the deletion, you can follow these steps:
#Go to the page by clicking [[Ayos (Book)|this link]]. Once there, select the button that says &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:{{TALKPAGENAME:Ayos (Book)}}|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Hangon_preload&amp;preloadtitle=This+{{pagetype|subjectspace=yes}}+should+not+be+speedy+deleted+because...+}} &lt;b style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.
#This will take you to the talk page, where you can make your case by explaining why the page does not meet Wikipedia's [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]].
Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do. For further help about the deletion, you could contact the user who first placed the tag or a [[Wikipedia:Highly Active Users|highly active user]] who is willingly to help with deletion. This message was left by a bot, so please do not contact the bot about the deletion. Thank you,}} - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 02:29, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please do not remove [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] notices from pages you have created yourself, as you did with [[:Ayos (Book)]]. If you do not believe the page should be deleted, then you may contest the deletion by clicking on the button that says: '''Click here to contest this speedy deletion''' and appears inside the speedy deletion notice. This will allow you to make your case '''''on the article's {{#if:Ayos (Book)| [[Talk:Ayos (Book){{!}}talk page]]|talk page}}'''''. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the article. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy2 --&gt; - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 02:37, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is your '''last warning'''. The next time you remove a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] notice from a page you have created yourself, as you did at [[:Ayos (Book)]], you may be '''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing without further notice'''. &lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy4 --&gt; - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 02:40, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

==Reported to AIV==
Hi Sagaciousman11, this is a notice to let you know that I have reported the issue of you removing speedy deletion templates to administrators. An administrator should assess the report in a short while, and they will take any appropriate actions. Please wait for an administrator before taking any further actions yourself. Thank you, - [[User:SDPatrolBot|SDPatrolBot]] ([[User talk:SDPatrolBot|talk]]) 02:41, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
