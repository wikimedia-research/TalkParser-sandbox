==Why this page was started==
Miko Peled is someone who is trying to decrease the gap between people in Israel. He has been working on this issue for many years, i wonder how come he has not have a page identifing his efforts on Wikipedia. His voice deserves to be heard. His words can be desribed as a '''neutral point of view''' which is one of the aims of the Wikipedia project. Ithink this page need a lot of work in the neutral point of view not by one side only.--[[User:Ashashyou|Ashashyou]] ([[User talk:Ashashyou|talk]]) 13:24, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

==The General's Son book==
I wonder if anyone who has read the book could write a review about it.--[[User:Ashashyou|Ashashyou]] ([[User talk:Ashashyou|talk]]) 13:52, 28 October 2012 (UTC)
==My view as an Egyptian Arabic about what i saw and heard so far==
My view is that some Israelis can talk in a neutral point of view.--[[User:Ashashyou|Ashashyou]] ([[User talk:Ashashyou|talk]]) 13:52, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

== &quot;Peace activist&quot;? ==

Why does Wikipedia permit the use of such nonsense terms?  If anything, the description of the man as a &quot;peace activist&quot; should be in quotations and preceded by &quot;self-described&quot;.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.224.41.113|99.224.41.113]] ([[User talk:99.224.41.113|talk]]) 01:11, 22 June 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
