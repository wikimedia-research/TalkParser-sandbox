[[File:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] This is the '''only warning''' you will receive. Your recent [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] will not be tolerated. Although vandalizing articles on occasions that are days or weeks apart from each other sometimes prevents editors from being [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]], your continued vandalism constitutes a long term pattern of abuse. The next time you vandalize a page, you may be '''blocked from editing Wikipedia without further notice'''. &lt;!-- Template:Uw-longterm --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Uw-vandalism4im --&gt; -[[User:WayKurat|WayKurat]] ([[User talk:WayKurat|talk]]) 08:52, 21 July 2012 (UTC)
