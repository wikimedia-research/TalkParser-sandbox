==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Getamarket.com]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Getamarket.com]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] as well as [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Getamarket.com|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Getamarket.com|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Hell in a Bucket|Hell In A Bucket]] ([[User talk:Hell in a Bucket|talk]]) 12:34, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. A page you recently created{{#if:|, [[:{{{1}}}]],}} may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]] for new pages, so it will shortly be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|removed]] (if it hasn't been already). Please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for any tests. For more information about creating articles, you may want to read [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]. You may also want to read our [[Wikipedia:Introduction|introduction page]] to learn more about contributing.

[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from {{#if: | [[:{{{1}}}]],}} a page you have created yourself.  If you do not believe the page should be deleted, you can place a {{[[Template:hangon|hangon]]}} tag on the page, under the existing speedy deletion tag (please do not remove the speedy deletion tag), and make your case on the page's {{#if:|[[{{TALKPAGENAME:{{{1}}}}}|talk page]]|talk page}}. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page. {{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}&lt;!-- Template:uw-speedy1 --&gt; [[User:Hell in a Bucket|Hell In A Bucket]] ([[User talk:Hell in a Bucket|talk]]) 12:41, 11 August 2009 (UTC)
