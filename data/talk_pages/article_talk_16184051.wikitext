[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] In a recent edit{{#if:Red Dwarf|&amp;nbsp;to the page [[:Red Dwarf]]}}, you changed one or more words from one international variety of English to another. Because  Wikipedia has readers from all over the world, our policy is to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English|respect national varieties of English]] in Wikipedia articles.

For subjects exclusively related to Britain (for example, a famous British person), use British English. For something related to the United States in the same way, use American English. If it is an international topic, use the same form of English the ''original'' author used.

In view of that, please don't change articles from one version of English to the other, even if you don't normally use the version the article is written in. Respect other people's versions of English. They in turn should respect yours. Other general guidelines on how Wikipedia articles are written can be found in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]]. If you have any queries about all this, you can ask me on my talk page or you can visit the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]]. {{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}} &lt;!-- Template:uw-lang --&gt; [[User talk:Islander|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGray&quot;&gt;'''Talk'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]][[User:Islander|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;'''Islander'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:34, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
