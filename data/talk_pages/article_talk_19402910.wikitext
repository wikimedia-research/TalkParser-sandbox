==Looking for a correct entry list==
If anybody has got an entry list that CORRECTLY lists which Reynard chassis (94D or 95D) the drivers used, with chassis numbers if possible, please post it. The lists I have found give everyone in 95Ds but Motor Racing Archive (who I believe own Reynard's records) gives only 11 95Ds produced!

==Policand in Reynard?==
The page is currently listing Policand as driving a Reynard in every race except Enna (rd 4), this is not correct. The reference at http://dizzy1000.tripod.com/1995.htm has him in a Lola in all races. I can confirm from pictures/videos that he drove the Lola in rounds 1,3,6,7,8 at least.
