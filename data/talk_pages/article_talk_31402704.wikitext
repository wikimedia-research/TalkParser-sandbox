;Welcome!
Hello and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikipedia]]. Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Cult of rina|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. The following links will help you begin editing on Wikipedia:
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]
*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Editing tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial|Picture tutorial]]
*[[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
*[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

;Please bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
* '''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Respect copyrights]]''' – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
* Maintain a '''[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]''' – this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
* Take particular care while adding biographical material about a '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|living person]]''' to any Wikipedia page to follow '''[[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons]]' policy'''. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|referenced]] with multiple [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].
* No '''[[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]]'''.
* If you are testing, please use the '''[[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]''' to &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Sandbox|action=edit}} do so]&lt;/span&gt;.
* Do not add troublesome content to any [[Wikipedia:What is an article|article]], such as: [[copyright]]ed text, [[Wikipedia:Libel|libel]], advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]]; doing so will result in your account or IP being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]].

The [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Wikipedia tutorial]] is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the [[Wikipedia:Help|help pages]], add a question to the [[Wikipedia:village pump|village pump]] or ask me on my talk page. By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!

This is an automated message from [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]].  I have performed a web search with the contents of [[:Zillya!]], and it appears to include material copied directly from http://zillya.com/en/zillya_antivirus.html.  

It is possible that the bot is confused and found similarity where none actually exists. If that is the case, you can remove the tag from the article. The article will be reviewed to determine if there are any copyright issues.

If substantial content is duplicated and it is not [[Wikipedia:Public domain|public domain]] or available under a compatible license, it will be deleted. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material. You may use such publications as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. See our [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright policy]] for further details. (If you own the copyright to the previously published content and wish to donate it, see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for the procedure.)&lt;!--This template located at Template:Csb-notice-pageincludes--&gt; [[User:CorenSearchBot|CorenSearchBot]] ([[User talk:CorenSearchBot|talk]]) 13:19, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Zillya!]]==
[[Image:Copyright-problem.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Zillya!]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. You might want to look at [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] for more details, or ask a question [[Wikipedia:Help desk|here]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Zillya!|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Zillya!|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Reaper Eternal|Reaper Eternal]] ([[User talk:Reaper Eternal|talk]]) 13:27, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

== [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|Proposed deletion]] of [[Zillya!]] ==
[[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|left|link=|48px|]]

The article [[Zillya!]] has been [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]]&amp;#32; because of the following concern:
:'''No indication that this software meets the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]].'''

While all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be [[WP:DEL#REASON|deleted for any of several reasons]].

You may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your [[Help:edit summary|edit summary]] or on [[Talk:Zillya!|the article's talk page]].

Please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{Tlc|proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion process]], but other [[Wikipedia:deletion process|deletion process]]es exist. The [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]] process can result in deletion without discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|articles for deletion]] allows discussion to reach [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for deletion.&lt;!-- Template:Proposed deletion notify --&gt; [[User:Reaper Eternal|Reaper Eternal]] ([[User talk:Reaper Eternal|talk]]) 17:03, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

== Nomination of [[Zillya!]] for deletion ==

&lt;div class=&quot;floatleft&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:0&quot;&gt;[[File:Ambox warning orange.svg|42px|alt=|link=]]&lt;/div&gt;A discussion is taking place as to whether the article '''[[Zillya!]]''' is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia according to [[Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]] or whether it should be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]].

The article will be discussed at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zillya!]] until a consensus is reached, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. The nomination will explain the policies and guidelines which are of concern. The discussion focuses on good quality evidence, and our policies and guidelines.

Users may edit the article during the discussion, including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion.  However, do not remove the article-for-deletion template from the top of the article. [[User:Reaper Eternal|Reaper Eternal]] ([[User talk:Reaper Eternal|talk]]) 01:06, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
