==hi all == 
I think this page is Useless, because this page is a copy of this page : [[List of French possessions and colonies]]

This other page is better informed that page.
I Think is better to destroy that page 

No ?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Picaballo|Picaballo]] ([[User talk:Picaballo|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Picaballo|contribs]]) 14:30, 16 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Revamp the page ==

This page could be useful if it gave a table of all French possessions ever that can be grouped by region and has the dates control was established and when control was lost by France. If no one has any objections I can do this in the near future.

I have started to reformat to make it similar to the article [[territorial evolution of the British Empire]]
