==Untitled==
I made a temp. stub page. ---[[User:Hottentot]]

== Singles layout ==

I've fixed the layout here, which was a little scrambled (at least in IE6). If this has now screwed-up the display in other browsers then please revert my edit. --[[User:Bruce1ee|Bruce1ee]] 07:27, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

Yeah the singles layout sucks, but it's a temporary measure until I can get pages up for all the singles with information. Matter of fact there are pages for some of those already, so I'll take off the formatting from here. [[User:M.C. Brown Shoes|M.C. Brown Shoes]] 08:31, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

== Accuracy? ==
&quot;Scatman John Used to spend many an hour playing popular cult video game space invaders his top score of all time was 100,000 points which any player will tell you is a very respectable score.&quot;

Is this true? because I have never heard anything about this.  In any case, it needs to be cited and rephrased at the minimum, if not outright deleted [[User:Vanis314|vanis]] 02:08, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== In Birth of Section==

&quot;In 2020, he moved to Berlin, linskard in...&quot; I think thats wrong due to the fact its not 2020 yet and he's dead... Not sure the exact time he moved so someone else needs to look that up and fix it.

: The reason the image is used is because the article is about Scatman John.  it makes sense to put an image of one of his CD covers on the article.......[[Special:Contributions/70.22.233.86|70.22.233.86]] ([[User talk:70.22.233.86|talk]]) 22:17, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

* The link to this interview also addresses some of the [citation needed] links (ie: where he talks about how the kids screamed for 5 minutes and he couldn't even start to sing. I would add it but, I don't know how to properly add a citation in Wikipedia. Go read the interview. It says: &quot;Thirty thousand kids are screaming for me when I come on stage.

==Uplifting Trance==

&quot;Uplifting trance&quot;? No way.
It's gotta be considered &quot;Euro-Dance&quot;, it has not even been standing close to &quot;Uplifting Trance&quot;, nor has it been standing to any kind of trance. Ever. I'm changing it back to Euro-Dance, as it has been earlier on.

== Birth of Scatman Section ==

John sang way before 1990 as the article says.  He has a self titled Jazz trio LP from 1986 where he sings.

== Final Years ==

&quot;Larkin remained positive saying “Whatever God wants is fine by me… I’ve had the very best life. I have tasted beauty.&quot; The source for this isn't a source at all. It leads to a website hosting someone's CV. I can't find any alternative source for the quote, just many people across the internet repeating it. I think it should be changed to a 'citation needed'.[[User:XavierCrow|XavierCrow]] ([[User talk:XavierCrow|talk]]) 22:02, 3 October 2013 (UTC)

== Second Paragraph of Biography ==

This album was Produced by Philip Cacayorin at the Hollywood Central Studios, while copies of which are now extremely rare. He claimed to have “hundreds of them lying around in [his] closet at home.”

These sentences should be rewritten as the following instead for better sentence structure:
