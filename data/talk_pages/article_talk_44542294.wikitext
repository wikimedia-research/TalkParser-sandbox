==Article name==

I was wondering how best to title the article in a way that reflects the fact that the group are not a country.  I have used the above wording for the article which (indirectly) connects to the similarly worded [[:Category:Human rights under territory controlling groups]].  In contrast [[:Category:Human rights by country]] is populated by articles with titles that start &quot;Human rights in XXX&quot;.  This is accepted presumably due to various levels of recognition of each state and with regard to stable borders.  In the case of this group all that there is an organisation that exercises control over groups of conquered people and an &quot;in the Islamic State...&quot; is not sufficient.  The wording presented seemed a fairly suitable fit in the circumstances.
