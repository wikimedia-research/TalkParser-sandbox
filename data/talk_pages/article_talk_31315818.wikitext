== Jyothika ==
I think it's odd to refer to Jyothika as Jyothika Saravanan in the text, like this text for instance &quot;He married Jyothika Saravanan...&quot;. She was not Jyothika Saravanan when he married her! She was Jyothika Sadanah when he married her and it would be much better to write just Jyothika, because that is the name she was and is known by, by the crowds.

Yeah, Jyothika should be refered as Jyothika Sadanah--[[User:Sinjanthu|Sinjanthu]] ([[User talk:Sinjanthu|talk]]) 15:15, 19 July 2013 (UTC)

==Filmography== 
Is it necessary to include all the films Surya has acted in, in the filmography section? Can't we include just notable films here? Otherwise, the list would keep getting really long. --[[User:Nmadhubala|Madhu]] 13:21, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

No, I think its best to list all of his movies, as any outsider wanting to know abt Surya will want to know all the movies he has done  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Knowledge is best|Knowledge is best]] ([[User talk:Knowledge is best|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Knowledge is best|contribs]]) 10:21, 11 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Hi
Please be advised suryas official fanclub at yahoo groups cant be added :( someone removed that link and black listed
dont you think its useful for fans to know that they can keep in touch with surya in some way and this fanclub is really a useful link?
Please white list the link and add it to this article
This is gaya his official fanclub owner, if you guys want I can ask surya himself to confirm the information, we are having online webcam chat sessions with him and soon we will be arranging a meeting with him for around two hundred members

== Role and character names ==

Re: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surya_Sivakumar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=406361612] The column title is &quot;ROLE&quot; not &quot;CHARACTER NAME&quot;. Having a generic &quot;Notes&quot; column in the tables is [[WP:BEANS|just plain bad idea inviting all sorts of non-encyclopedic fancruft to be entered]]. [[Special:Contributions/Active_Banana|''Active'']] [[User:Active Banana|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''Banana&lt;/font&gt;''']]  [[User talk:Active Banana|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;''bananaphone''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:26, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
:Concur. Each is just a word or two stating how he was part of the film. I don't see why they should be separated (doesn't aid understanding, readability, etc). And I don't see what else would go in &quot;notes&quot;, but if there were some other sort of note, why would it be lumped into the same column as the existing info? The other material in that column is awards, which is a separate issue from whether he was a lead vs cameo or whatever. Why not have an &quot;Awards&quot; column for it? [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] ([[User talk:DMacks|talk]]) 22:40, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
:On the other hand, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers#Filmography tables]] disagrees with me (it supports a &quot;Role&quot; column, and a separate &quot;Notes&quot; column with both awards and &quot;Guest appearance&quot; tags). But that guideline (which uses an example close to the genre of this article here!) also disagrees with other aspects of the table: advises against using multirow for years, doesn't have a separate &quot;Language&quot; column (assumes a standard value, with a &quot;Notes&quot; annotation if not that standard).

== Main photo==
Hi, i'd like to point out that the main photograph of the actor in the article is kind of old.. I'm sure much better photos of surya exist. Hope someone changes it..

: Don't add merge to template without any reason.
