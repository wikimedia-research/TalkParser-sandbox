{{unblock reviewed|1=What the fuck? Let's block every school in London, for a year. Only it's not just every school, it's certain libraries too - such as Croydon. And it's not just anons, but registered users too. So even though my account has thousands of edits, and has been active since 2005, I cannot edit. &lt;br/&gt; And why is that? Because some London school kid was the &quot;Avril Lavigne vandal&quot;. I don't even know what that vandal did, but unless it was the reincarnation of WoW, this is overkill. Fucking Avril Lavigne, who gives a shit? Her bio is going to be watched by hundreds of adoring fans and BLP fetishists anyway. Unblock this account, and all those listed [[Special:WhatLinksHere/London_Grid_for_Learning|here]]. Yes, you're going to get vandalism coming from this address, but just killing write access for thousands isn't the answer.|decline=If you are not willing to give us the information about your account so we can help you, then you are not going to be able to edit from school. This IP will remain blocked.

**I do not think that my account matters, and I don't want it tied to a location.  What matters is that whoever the &quot;Avril Lavigne vandal&quot; is, will no longer give a crap about Wikipedia, and that this block is unsuitable.  Block anon-editing? Maybe. Enable only auto-confirmed users? Maybe.  Killing all write access?  For a year?  No. - [[Special:Contributions/82.198.250.66|82.198.250.66]] ([[User talk:82.198.250.66#top|talk]]) 14:34, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
***IPBlockExemption won't tie your account to one location any more than editing with your account does. It merely means that you will be able to edit through hardblocks when logged-in, regardless of where you edit from. -&lt;font color=&quot;32CD32&quot;&gt;''[[User:Jéské Couriano|Jeremy]]''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;4682B4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jéské Couriano|v^_^v]] [[Wikipedia:Trading card game|Cardmaker]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 18:39, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
***I don't necessarily agree with it, and I think it's heavy-handed, but apparently it was necessary. These blocks expire in August. You don't have to tie yourself to a location if you request unblocking from your user talk page and note you've been caught up in a hard block. At that point, you can protest the LGFL blocks at [[WP:AN]] –&lt;font face=&quot;verdana&quot; color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;[[user:xeno|'''xeno''']]&lt;/font&gt;[[user talk:xeno|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot; face=&quot;verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:36, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
****If you're not going to unblock this range, can you post this at AN for me now?  I'm pretty sure other admins would see that it wasn't particularly &quot;necessary&quot;. - [[Special:Contributions/82.198.250.66|82.198.250.66]] ([[User talk:82.198.250.66#top|talk]]) 14:41, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
