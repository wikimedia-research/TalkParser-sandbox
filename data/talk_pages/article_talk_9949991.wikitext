== Authority ==

Just a note that James Reveal's current list of authorities for suprageneric names has what appears to be an update to the APG publication's statement that Robert Brown published this name in 1835. [http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/fam/allspgfileD.html The site] states that [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|Mart.]] published the name in late 1835. We probably need to watch for publications with the update. [[User:Sminthopsis84|Sminthopsis84]] ([[User talk:Sminthopsis84|talk]]) 13:46, 12 July 2013 (UTC)
:I have updated to and added APG III to the families and orders, except for the few places I know where questions exist, but my next stage is to check everything against the Reveal. Please go ahead and change this, as I don't have the time right now. Thanks. --[[User:AfadsBad|AfadsBad]] ([[User talk:AfadsBad|talk]]) 15:31, 12 July 2013 (UTC)
