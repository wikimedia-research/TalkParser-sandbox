== Mediation Case: Anti-Brahmanism ==

: You have indicated that you are willing to accept an assignment as a mediator. I have assigned [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-04-11_Anti-Brahmanism|this case]] to you. If you don't want to take the case on, just say so at the bottom of the request, delegate it to someone else and update the case list accordingly. Before you begin the mediation please read the [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Suggestions_for_mediators|suggestions for mediators]]. You can also review earlier mediation cases to get an understanding for possible procedures.

==Lentil article==

Hello there.  I saw your change on the Lentil article and it gave me an idea.  First of all, hopefully the values I entered with my edit match those contained within NDB # 16069!  The change you made did not actually make any changes to the article, but if you had used the note= parameter with the intent of annotating the source, e.g.:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{nutritionalvalue | name = Lentils, raw (dry weight)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
source_usda=1&lt;br&gt;
note=NDB No. 16069}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

then the box would have appeared like the following ( for this example, I took out the nutrient values and floated the box to the left):

{{nutritionalvalue | name = Lentils, raw (dry weight)
| water=10.4 g
| opt1n = Skipped nutrients
| opt1v = ...
| float=left
| source_usda=1 
| note=NDB No. 16069}}

I think it would be an excellent idea for the actual NDB number to be included.  Just a thought.  Anyway, the source_usda parameter in the template only accepts source_usda=yes or source_usda=1 as far as I know.  Unfortunately, the nutrient values have to be plugged in manually.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chango369w|Chango369w]] ([[User talk:Chango369w|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chango369w|contribs]]) 12:49, 27 March 2013 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:: Your change to the [[Lentil]] article eventually resulted in a link to the USDA Database Entry as a note.  I spoke with someone at the USDA that has working knowledge of their website.  Barring a real time client/server connection between Wikipedia and the USDA database, it would take a download of the Database onto a Wikipedia server along with the coding infrastructure to avoid all of the manual updating.  Fortunately they update only once a year, with updates occurring to unprocessed foods like fruits and vegetables occurring on an even more infrequent basis.
