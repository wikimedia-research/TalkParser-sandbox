I removed following from the article. Quite a many people are abandoned, so of course you're going to find them among murderes as well. As such, this remark proves nothing and only accounts to sensationalism. &amp;mdash; [[User:Timo Honkasalo|Timo Honkasalo]] 14:08, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Serial killers who were abandoned include:-


1.  [[Mary Bell]];

2.  [[Jeffery Dahmer]];

3.  [[Charles Manson]].

I believe the correct term is &quot;Reactive Attachment Disorder&quot;, not &quot;Abandoned child syndrome&quot; --[[User:Blu Aardvark|Blu Aardvark]] 8 July 2005 12:46 (UTC)

I'm not finding anything at all on &quot;Abandoned Child Syndrome&quot;- at least not by any reputable sources. I'm wondering if this article can redirect to &quot;Reactive Attachment Disorder&quot; [[User:Swilk|Swilk]] 01:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

I think that if this page remains; sexual promiscuity should be added as a symptom. Usually those who have been abandoned as a child, seek out father-figures or mother-figures to compensate for the fact that they have been without one. They tend to seek love and acceptance from others and sometimes it takes on the form or having many sexual encounters as a way to feel closeness, love or acceptance.[[User:159.53.110.141|159.53.110.141]] 17:57, 20 September 2007 (UTC)hotchina
