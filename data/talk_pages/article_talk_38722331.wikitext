[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Lugia2453|Lugia2453]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/24.15.200.193|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fremd_High_School?diff=542267978 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:William Fremd High School]], because it didnâ€™t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Lugia2453|my talk page]]. Thanks, &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Lugia2453|Lugia2453]] ([[User talk:Lugia2453|talk]]) 22:02, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
