==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Musaab Ali]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Musaab Ali]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guideline for biographies]]. You may also wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Musaab Ali|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Musaab Ali|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-bio-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Eeekster|Eeekster]] ([[User talk:Eeekster|talk]]) 23:27, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

== April 2010 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved, as you did at [[:Musaab Ali]]. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. 

Creating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|article about yourself]] is ''strongly'' discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on [[wikipedia:articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not ''start'' articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to [[Wikipedia:No original research]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. 

If you are not [[WP:notability|&quot;notable&quot;]] under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_social_networking.2C_or_memorial_site|Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider]] and would thus qualify for [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#a7|speedy deletion]].  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later. (See [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians with articles]].)  Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:uw-autobiography --&gt; [[User:Eeekster|Eeekster]] ([[User talk:Eeekster|talk]]) 23:28, 10 April 2010 (UTC)
