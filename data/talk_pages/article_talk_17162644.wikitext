===Your edits to [[June 27]]===
Dear [[User:89.100.18.32|89.100.18.32]], 
Some of your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=June_27&amp;diff=208794661&amp;oldid=208790376 edits] on the page [[June 27]] have been undone by PseudoBot, a robot built to keep the date pages tidy. The problems are:
: You don't seem to have linked to a Wikipedia page for the person you added.
If the page exists, check that you've spelled and capitalized the name the same way as the article, and try again. If it doesn't yet exist, read [[WP:BIO|this page]] carefully before creating it. In particular, you [[WP:COI|shouldn't create a page about yourself]] or anyone you know personally.
If this bot has got it wrong (as can unfortunately happen), please accept its author's apologies, and (if you would like) leave a message on [[User talk:Pseudomonas|this talk page]] with the details, so it can be improved.
