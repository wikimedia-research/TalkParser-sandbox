*Please read [[WP:EL]] before adding more external links on wikipedia articles. I have reverted your additions to [[WaveRunner]].

I am confused - YOU also deleted links posted by a wikipedia supervisor like yourself. The links placed were in accordance with the reference you made. Please change it back!
