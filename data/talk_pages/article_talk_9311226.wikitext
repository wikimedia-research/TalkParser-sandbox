This song is not noteworthy, and the article (which is a stub) consists of a description of the song's formation, uncited, and a section, which I quote;

&quot;The song starts with a synthesised part playing staccato crotchets. This riff is sequenced throughout the song. Light percussion woodblocks are added after a short while. The bass guitar joins the synthesiser and plays with it throughout the song.&quot;

Unless you know that this song will be the next single from the album, there is no reason to have a page for it until then. [[User:ErleGrey|ErleGrey]] 17:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

* Many albums have their own individual song pages, and in light of the song's history, this is one is notable.  &quot;Northern Whale&quot; also has single potential, and if my hunch is correct, will be the next GBQ single.  The article should stand.  [[User:BGC|BGC]] 18:09, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
