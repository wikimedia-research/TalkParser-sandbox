== Replaceable fair use File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg ==
[[File:Ambox warning.svg|32px|left]]
Thanks for uploading '''[[:File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg]]'''. I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|first non-free content criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could be found or created that provides substantially the same information or which could be adequately covered with text alone. If you believe this media is not replaceable, please:

# Go to [[:File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg|the media description page]] and edit it to add {{tlx|di-replaceable fair use disputed}}, '''without deleting the original replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[File talk:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Contributions|target=Syrup_won%27t_stop_em&amp;namespace=6}} this link]&lt;/span&gt;. Note that even if you follow steps 1 and 2 above, non-free media which could be replaced by freely licensed alternatives will be deleted 2 days after this notification (7 days if uploaded before 13 July 2006), per the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|non-free content policy]].  If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].

==Non-free rationale for File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg==
[[File:Copyright-problem.svg|64px|left|alt=|link=]]
Thanks for uploading or contributing to '''[[:File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg]]'''. I notice the file page specifies that the file is being used under [[WP:NFCC|non-free content criteria]], but there is not a suitable explanation or rationale as to why each specific use in Wikipedia is acceptable. Please go to [[:File:Amanda Downum by Katie Cowden.jpg|the file description page]], and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|non-free rationale]].

If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified the non-free rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'file' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/Syrup won&amp;#39;t stop em|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;File&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If the file is already gone, you can still make a [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|request for undeletion]] and ask for a chance to fix the problem.&lt;!-- Template:You can request undeletion --&gt; If you have any questions, please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].
