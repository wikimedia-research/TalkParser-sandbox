'''Welcome!'''

Hello, {{BASEPAGENAME}}, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! {{#if:||Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]].}} I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created{{#if:Parkourex| , like [[:Parkourex]],}} may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]] for page creation, and may soon be deleted (if it hasn't already). 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''&lt;code&gt;{{tl|helpme}}&lt;/code&gt;''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

==Speedy deletion of [[:Parkourex]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Parkourex]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a club, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific notability guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|people]] and for [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|organizations]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Parkourex|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or &quot;db&quot; tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[ Talk:Parkourex|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-club-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;404040&quot;&gt;[[User:Skomorokh|&lt;font face=&quot;Goudy Old Style&quot; color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Skomorokh&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 21:36, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
