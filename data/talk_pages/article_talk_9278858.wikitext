== Professional review / External link suggestion ==

As an editor at ''Crawdaddy!,'' and to comply with COI guidelines, I am not posting the link to this 1978 piece about ''Love Bites'' that we just posted to the site. However, I would like to recommend it on its merits, and hope that an editor will find the time to examine the piece and—if he or she sees fit—post it to this page's professional reviews section, or as an external link. I appreciate your time.
