== Gilbert Prousch ==

Sorry Daniel, but original research is something else... There are also lots of reliable sources for Prousch (apart from the [[documenta]] research database I referenced in the article, [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Gilbert+Prousch%22&amp;btnG=Nach+B%C3%BCchern+suchen&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=de Google Books], [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Gilbert%20Prousch%22&amp;hl=de&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ps Google Scholar]), so there is literally no justification for not citing this different spelling at all. Apart from the fact that I ''know'' that Prousch is correct, I didn't even erase the &quot;wrong&quot; form Proesch, since (you are right in this case) there are heaps of good sources for that spelling. But as I said, there are good sources for both forms, so I struggle to understand why you don't want to include Prousch. --[[User:Mai-Sachme|Mai-Sachme]] ([[User talk:Mai-Sachme|talk]]) 22:31, 16 January 2012 (UTC)

:Lets keep discussion of this on the article's talk page. That way, it is easier for other people to join in with their opinions. Anyway, I think we are getting to a version we can both live with now. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 23:13, 16 January 2012 (UTC)

==Edits==
For someone so concerned about the correct information, relevance, and referenced material you have a horrid way of going about your reversion explanations.  Using words such as &quot;crap&quot;, &quot;oy vey&quot;, &quot;nobody cares&quot; or impertinent British slang isn't useful or very constructive to the editor whose post is being reverted even if their edit was &quot;crap&quot;.  No need to reply.  [[User:DiefendorfA|DiefendorfA]] ([[User talk:DiefendorfA|talk]]) 03:58, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

:Your comment refers to edit summaries not to actual content, so I think your section heading is misleading. I never insult editors in edit summaries, or elsewhere, but I have no problem describing bad content as what it is, bad content, or to use a nice short phrase to describe content that really is entirely void of value, crap. I see no reason not to express mild exasperation when we repeatedly have to deal with the same old bad edits time and time again. If somebody posts some self-aggrandising crap then I think removing it with a comment saying that nobody cares is both accurate and appropriate. Formal language is required in articles but I don't see how an encyclopaedia that has an almost semi-official policy on [[WP:BOLLOCKS|Complete Bollocks]] can object to a a bit of British slang in edit summaries or on talk pages. I must say that I am at a loss to understand what your objection is. Could it be that I have somehow upset you in some other way? If so, I apologise but I really have no idea how. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 20:40, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

== Regarding Peter Cundill entry on Value Investing ==

In response to your Revert comment &quot;If he has no article then he doesn't belong here&quot;, I've created the article [[Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Peter_Cundill]] and it is awaiting review and approval. There is an existing article, [[Cundill_Prize|Cundill Prize]] that also references to [[Peter Cundill]]. I guess I should have waited for the article to be approved before editing [[Value_Investing| Value Investing]] to link it. --[[User:Peculiar Investor|Peculiar Investor]] ([[User talk:Peculiar Investor|talk]]) 21:37, 2 February 2012 (UTC)

:Yes, it would have been better to have waited but its nothing to worry about. If the article gets approved you can put it back. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 21:43, 2 February 2012 (UTC)

I went on [[Google]], and I typed in &quot;What is Patrick Star's Birthday?&quot; I clicked this [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090904145212AAWCtXz page], and it showed Patrick's birthday. When you look Patrick's birthday up on Google, there will be lots of results incidcating he was born on Feburary 26, 1986. --[[User:ChipsyPopz1|ChipsyPopz1]] ([[User talk:ChipsyPopz1|talk]]) 19:31, 5 February 2012 (UTC)

:That's not how we do things. You would need to check whether the sources are [[WP:RS|reliable]] and then reference them in the article. Unfortunately you can find a lot of rubbish if you just search the internet and believe the first thing you find. 
:Yahoo Answers is one to be very wary of. A lot of its answers are complete rubbish. Often it is just people who don't know the answer making up answers to the questions. There is no way to check who the people answering are and whether they really know anything at all. In this case, at least the answer is referenced back to a Spongebob wiki but the links are dead and it is not considered reliable anyway.
:Anyway, fictional characters do not have birth dates because they are not real. Even if they have an official fictional birth date, these can not be used in an article in the same way as the birth date of a real person. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 20:09, 5 February 2012 (UTC)

==Birthdates for fictional characters==
Sorry, but you could have left a more friendly warning. I was just test editing, and I didn't know you weren't supposed to put a fictional character's birthdate next to their name. Besides, on SpongePedia you can find out very cleary that Patrick's birthday is Feburary 26th, 1986. Yahoo Answers wasn't my ''only'' source.--[[User:ChipsyPopz1|ChipsyPopz1]] ([[User talk:ChipsyPopz1|talk]]) 02:34, 7 February 2012 (UTC)

:You might be right about my tone and I apologise for that. The problem is that we have had people putting those dodgy dates in before, over and over again, and they wouldn't listen to explanation of why it was wrong. As this happens quite a lot it looked like you were just the same person doing it again. If I was wrong about that I am very sorry. Normally I am pretty good at knowing the difference between people who are messing about and people who just made a mistake but may have got it wrong this time.
:Anyway, I have taken the warning off your talk page and put a much nicer welcome message on instead. That has lots of helpful links and I hope you find it useful. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 20:59, 7 February 2012 (UTC)

==Request for Comment on the Berlin page==

Hi - since you edited the [[Berlin]] page within the last couple months, I'm writing to ask if you'd like to weigh in on a current content dispute that has resulted in a [[Talk:Berlin#RfC: Buddy Bears or no Buddy Bears?|request for comment]]. The issue, simply, is whether the Berlin article should include an image of the &quot;Buddy Bears&quot; or not.

==Vintage TV spam==

I noticed that one of the pages on my watchlist had been edited to include mention of the subject's appearance on a Vintage TV show. I edited this to tone down ridiculous language and have performed a number of similar edits on other pages as the editor (an anonymous user: 212.188.172.130) is going through page after page adding the same text re. appearances on Vintage TV. However, I see that in the past you have reverted such edits as unencyclopedic trivia. I don't really want to have to go through these pages one by one removing these passages. I wondered if there was a way for you as an admin to revert a series of edits across different pages, where the same criteria apply? [[User:Dubmill|Dubmill]] ([[User talk:Dubmill|talk]]) 14:17, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== I was filing the report on 89.100.207.51 when I saw your warning ==

I was noticing the dispute on [[Katana]] and the talkpage blanking on the ip's talk, looked further and posted a report on 3rr noticeboard.

== Your advice on avoiding having edits deleted ==

Daniel, as an experienced Deletionist, could you please point me to some advice about how to learn to avoid ''edit deletion''. I can find much said about page deletion, but I work more on small updates than new pages. I'd like to learn which of my page edits got removed and why, so that I can make sure that any contributions I bother to make are worthwhile and survive. Any ideas how I can track which of my contributions were not up to scratch, or articles that discuss such things. Help gratefully appreciated. [[User:Artemgy|Artemgy]] ([[User talk:Artemgy|talk]]) 19:19, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:Presumably you have the setting which adds the articles you edit to your watchlist enabled? If not, you should probably enable that. The watchlist will give you a good idea of what edits are occurring after yours and you can see if your edits are being removed or corrected. If they are deleted then the article history will show you who removed them. They should also provide an edit summary explaining why. These summaries may be terse but they should be enough for you to have an idea what the problem was. (If not, you are perfectly within your rights to leave a note for the editor asking why they removed the edit as, apart from uncontroversial reversions of obvious vandalism, all edits should have a summary.) For example, if you see edit summaries saying that your edits are unreferenced then you know that you need to focus on referencing rather than there necessarily being a problem with the edit content itself. If you see your edits regularly getting changed in stylistic ways then that means that your edit is basically OK but that you need to adopt a style more in keeping with the [[WP:MOS|manual of style]]. If there are more substantial problems then the edit summaries should tell you. Finally, it is worth becoming familiar with the &quot;compare selected revisions&quot; facility in the article history. This shows you two versions of the article side by side with the differences highlighted. Once you get used to using this it is easy to see exactly what parts are being changed.  --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 20:22, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

== Kirkuk ==

This page was completely 'vandalised' by pro-turkish editors, claiming that kurds are a minority? with subheadings such as kurdish presence? This city is by majority Kurdish and part of Iraq so I do not understand why this Turk is claiming 3 million turkmen people live in this city. Utter nonsense and fictional. That is why i have removed these statements.

:Can you point to a previous version of the article that was more accurate?
:Can you point to independent references that support the population figures?
:Can you stop removing the notable Turkmen when you add in the notable Kurds?

:I suggest you make your case on the article's talk page. If you can show that the current content is inaccurate and that you are willing to work towards a text that is accurate and fair to all sides, including the Turkmen, then people will listen. If you just keep on reverting you will be tagged as a partisan vandal and nobody will take you seriously. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 20:28, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

Ok, Line 56: 'The city consists of Turkmens, Arabs and SOME kurds and assyrians'. You might at least agree that the word some is inappropriate. Then comes the big fictions- 'the Turkmen population in the city is estimated to have increased from 3 000,000 to 3 500,000', now according to that same page, the population of the city was 850,787 people (2009), tell me how is that possible? (also the reference does not exist). Then it gets insulting, with the subheading 'Kurdish presence', imagine somebody editing a page about Guildford with the subheading 'English presence'. The text then explains wrongly that kurds have a SHORT history, and that a family moved in to the area (any rational person would know that there must be more history than that). Line 120- My favourite: 500,000 Turkmen displaced by Saddams regime (now ignoring the fact that most Turkmen were known to be pro-Saddam regime), the original text has been distorted as it actually says '120,000 kurds have been displaced as well as other ethnic minorities'. Line 129- 'They were supriesed by Kurdish politics The Kurds began to use the politic as Saddam Hussian in the city of Kirkuk'. That line does not make sense. As for the last section I included notable people that exist and there are pages for these people on Wikipedia. I did not remove any of the other links for people that do or have existed on planet earth.

I am new to editing on wikipedia so I am not very familar with how things work just yet and I do apologise for that, but what I am familiar with is Turkish chauvinism (Still denying the armenian genocide) and some peoples denial of Kurdish existance.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Truths1234|Truths1234]] ([[User talk:Truths1234|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Truths1234|contribs]]) 21:09, 3 May 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Yes. I have looked at it a bit more and I can see that some of this was very dubious. I have reverted to a previous version. That version was a bit too pro-Kurdish but I have done my best to straighten it out to be fair to everybody. It probably isn't perfect. What we really need is better references. When there are good references it is much easier to check which claims are incorrect. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 21:18, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

== [[RINJ]] ==

Hey there, [[user:DanielRigal|Daniel]],

I've recently been editing a page called &quot;[[RINJ]],&quot; specifically the section titled, &quot;Controversy&quot; (I had originally tried inserting the relevant pieces of information into the main body of the article, but it was quickly deleted). Another user, who I suspect is aligned with the group RINJ and Wikipedia editor Micheal O'Brien, has been removing my edits and calling them vandalism. I admit I am a novice editor of Wikipedia, but I am not a novice user of encyclopedias or uneducated about the subject matter. Personally, I question the validity of the entry in the first place, as it seems very much to be a vanity page rather than an entry into an encyclopedia, but it was already challenged by someone else, I believe. Anyway, I was hoping you would take a look at [[RINJ]] and perhaps give me your input on the subject, and consider lending your support in ensuring the page is complete. Much appreciated.

== Re:Day of the Dead ==

Is the correct traslation of &quot;Dia de los muertos&quot;, [[Google]] is not everything [[User:Enemyusuar|Enemyusuar]] ([[User talk:Enemyusuar|talk]]) 00:06, 27 May 2012 (UTC).

:In English &quot;dead&quot; can be singular or plural. We talk about the &quot;war dead&quot; being all the people who die in a war, not just one of them. This is why it is important to use the official translations not rely on our own imperfect knowledge and assumptions. When I Googled I specifically looked at Google News, books and Scholar. I know a lot of rubbish gets indexed in Google but focussing on these more reliable subsets normally gives a good idea of where things really stand. 
:Anyway, thanks for the reply. I was wondering whether the change was a mistake or deliberate vandalism so I am very glad to know that it was a genuine misunderstanding of the translation. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal#top|talk]]) 11:13, 27 May 2012 (UTC)

Hi Daniel, thank you for taking a look at the article I've created for one of my clients, Steve Nguyen.

== On suggested deletion of PageRain ==

Thankyou for reviewing my article about PageRain. I am the author of the article and the owner of PageRain, I do not try to hide this.

My reason for adding this page is that every competing CDN has their own page, all referenced from this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network

Most of the pages describing CDNs referenced from this article are similar half-promotional articles, likely created by the owners of the CDNs. I believe the article about PageRain, outlining the focus and infrastructure is as relevant as any of the other articles.

I do not mind if the article needs editing and will do anyting needed to edit it to make it more objective than what I've already done. I ask that you please guide me in accomplishing this.

:Thanks for being upfront about this. I only did a quick Google on the subject but I found so little that I doubt it is going to be possible for the article to be kept. What you would need to find are independent, professional reviews, other independent press coverage and stuff like that. If you can find good coverage, and it doesn't have to be in English, then maybe the article can be saved. I must say that I think it is unlikely though.

Hi, Daniel! [[Bethel Christian School (Ruston, Louisiana)]] is actually a K-12 so it is counted as a high school.

::Hey, it's fine! I checked your profile; it says you are in the UK so I can see why you were confused. In the United States educational system a PreK-12 ''always'' includes high school. &quot;PreK-12&quot; indicates a range of school years or grades. High school typically occupies grades 9 through 12 though it can be more (8-12) or less (10-12) - A PreK-12 institution covers all years of primary and secondary education.
