Info duplicated in [[Myrmidones]] - moved additional info there

== Dinosaur? ==

Seems like this perfectly good disambig page had been turned into a page on some obscure dinosaur (see old version: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Myrmidon&amp;oldid=280125034). Reverted it to the last disamb page, since it belongs on its own page ([[Myrmidon (dinosaur)]]?), and lacked any references except something on Discoverychannels websites that i completely failed to find.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.16.208.120|62.16.208.120]] ([[User talk:62.16.208.120|talk]]) 06:20, 30 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
