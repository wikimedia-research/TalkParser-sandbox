Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/49.199.168.44|your contributions]]&amp;#32;so far. I hope you like the place and decide to stay.

You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but if you wish to acquire [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|additional privileges]], you can simply create an account.  It's free, requires no personal information, and lets you:
* '''[[Help:Starting a new page|Create new pages]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:How to rename a page|rename pages]]'''
* Edit '''[[Wikipedia:Semi-protection policy|semi-protected pages]]'''
* '''[[Help:Upload|Upload images]]'''
* Have your own '''[[Wikipedia:Watchlist|watchlist]]''', which shows when articles you are interested in have changed

If you edit without an account, your [[IP address]] (49.199.168.44) is used to identify you instead.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikipedian and '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup&amp;campaign=anonwelcometemplate}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''.  If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:BracketBot|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page.  We also have an [[WP:TMM|intuitive guide on editing]] if you're interested. By the way, please make sure to [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign and date]] your talk page comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;''').
