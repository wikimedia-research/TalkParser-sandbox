== Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia or South Africa ==

What's Mike Harris' nationality? I gather he was born in [[Northern Rhodesia]] and, during his Formula One races in 1962, was in fact Northern Rhodesian. This page lists him as South African, though.

:It depends on which source you believe - some say Rhodesian, some say South African. I don't know if Northern Rhodesia issued racing licences, and if not, he may have raced under a foreign licence - it's the nationality of the racing licence that should appear in the infobox. We should probably find a few sources and make a note regarding the lack of clarity - I'll do that when I get the chance, unless someone else wants to.
