==Proposed Merger==
While Ó Muraíle's edition is obviously an edition of great scholarly importance, I think the information here should be merged with the article on [[Leabhar na nGenealach]]. This page could remain as a redirect to that page, since many people refer to the text by the English title. Let me know what you think!

:A merge seems sensible.  I don't mind in which direction --[[User:Rumping|Rumping]] ([[User talk:Rumping|talk]]) 11:55, 17 March 2009 (UTC)
