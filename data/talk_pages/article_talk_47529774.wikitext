==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Wikipedia is a dictionary]]==

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Wikipedia is a dictionary]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Obviously invented|section A11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day|something invented/coined/discovered by the article's creator or someone they know personally]], and it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. 

If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Wikipedia is a dictionary|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled &quot;Click here to contest this speedy deletion&quot;. This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]]. If the page is deleted, and you wish to retrieve the deleted material for future reference or improvement, then please contact the deleting administrator. &lt;!-- Template:Db-invented-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Cahk|Cahk]] ([[User talk:Cahk|talk]]) 04:48, 15 August 2015 (UTC)
