[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Minna Sora no Shita|Minna Sora no Shita]]. I wanted to let you know that I undid one of [[Special:Contributions/206.116.206.231|your recent contributions]],&amp;nbsp;such as the one you made with &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Monteith?diff=564187048 this edit]&lt;/span&gt; to [[:Cory Monteith]], because it didn’t appear constructive to me. If you think I made a mistake, or if you have any questions, you can leave me a message on [[User_talk:Minna Sora no Shita|my talk page]]. Thanks. &lt;!-- Template:Huggle/warn-1 --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism1 --&gt;[[User:Minna Sora no Shita|みんな空の下]] ([[User talk:Minna Sora no Shita|トーク]]) 05:38, 14 July 2013 (UTC)
