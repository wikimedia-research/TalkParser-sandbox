== Alkalinity versus Acid neutralizing capacity ==

Linking to both [[Alkalinity]] and [[Acid neutralizing capacity]] in the same line does not follow the general rule &quot;do not wikilink any other words in the line&quot; from [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)]] but I'm not sure whether to remove the Alkalinity link.  Basically (no pun intended), there is overlap between those two pages but I don't know enough about the subject to say whether a merge would make sense or not.

The South African party is surely the primary meaning, this should redirect there. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 20:09, 18 August 2010 (UTC)

The result of the move request was: '''page moved'''.

[[ANC]] → {{no redirect|1=ANC (disambiguation)}} — The [[African National Congress]] is surely the primary meaning. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 12:08, 19 September 2010 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' pending convincing evidence that [[African National Congress]] is the ''clear'' primary topic.  [[Special:Contributions/69.3.72.249|69.3.72.249]] ([[User talk:69.3.72.249|talk]]) 03:46, 20 September 2010 (UTC)
**Come on!  Do we need convincing evidence as to what e.g. the primary meaning of USA is?  See [[USA (disambiguation)]]. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 22:55, 21 September 2010 (UTC)

*'''Support'''. I'm very curious to know which of the other meanings might even possibly challenge the African National Congress as primary meaning. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 04:29, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - I can't see any other meaning coming close to African National Congress.

*'''Support''', common sense and time spent in the real world tell us what the primary topic is here.--[[User:Kotniski|Kotniski]] ([[User talk:Kotniski|talk]]) 08:51, 27 September 2010 (UTC)
