[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Hello. In case you didn't know, when you add content to [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]] and Wikipedia pages that have open discussion, such as on [[User_talk:MZMcBride#When_do_you_normally_delete_.22secret_pages.22_on_Wikipedia.3F]], you should [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your posts]] by typing four [[tilde]]s  ( &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; ) at the end of your comment. You may also click on the signature button [[Image:Signature_icon.png]] located above the edit window.  This will automatically insert a signature with your username or IP address and the time you posted the comment. This information is useful because other editors will be able to tell who said what, and when. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-tilde --&gt; [[user talk:mono|&lt;font color=&quot; gold&quot;&gt;m&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot; orange&quot;&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot; red&quot;&gt;ɳ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot; purple&quot;&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:01, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
