==Slide or Slideback==
I am not disputing that the slide may be called &quot;a slideback,&quot; but can anyone point to some good examples of this use? I can't recall running into it, and I've been browsing gun magazines at least once in a while for nearly 30 years now ... just browsing, mind you, but still.

:It appears the someone is again trying to call the slide a &quot;slideback&quot;. I've never heard/read this term either. I just did a google-search, and the only hits showed thing like &quot;hold the slide back&quot;. [[User:AliveFreeHappy|AliveFreeHappy]] ([[User talk:AliveFreeHappy|talk]]) 23:06, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
