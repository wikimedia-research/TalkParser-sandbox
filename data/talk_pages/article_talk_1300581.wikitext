== Grammar, again! ==

The section FL Studio Volume 1...
...has some sub-standard grammar. Doesn't sound like an english author

&quot;FL Studio Volume 1

Regular Edition
In 1998, FL Studio beginned but was developed by Image-Line Software. They started with the standard edition and launched but created a Twitter and Facebook page.[1][2]. When it started Deckadance became a studio friend with FL Studio in 1999. The part of the first volume regular edition is when was downloaded, they need to record it while producing.
In 1994, Fruity Video Player was launched before FL Studio but was jacked to create the CBS, Teletoon, UPN Kids, Kids' WB, Sega Channel, Disney Channel and TeenNick animated 3D series JumpStart Superheroes.
[edit]XXL (without Producer Edition)
In 1998, FL Studio began and was launched but started with the XXL edition without the Producer Edition. Until late-2000, The XXL edition was renamed &quot;FL Studio 8: The Producer Edition XXL&quot;.

I'd fix this but i don't understand what he's talking about. This is probably the worst wikipedia page I have ever seen. It reminds me of how the site can be portrayed in comedy. I've searched around online, but unfortunately I can't find anything written about the history of FL Studio, so I can't fix this myself.

==READ: Criteria for Including Notable FL Users==
While I'm sure many edits in this regard are well-meaning, the artists section over the years has a history of being glutted with users of dubious or unestablished notability. As such, to keep the list under control and immediately relevant, here are the criteria for including an artist/producer ('''both criteria must be met''' to avoid deletion):
# '''The user must have a Wikipedia entry'''; if you want to add an artist onto this page who doesn't have an entry, consider it impetus to do some research and create the artist page yourself.
# The artist's '''use of FL Studio must be mentioned''' in an independent source verifying the use of the product by the artist. A reference on the artist's Wikipedia entry is not enough. Sources could include the artist's official website, a music magazine, or a third-party interview. An entry on the FL Studio Power Users page does not count. If the Wikipedia entry doesn't reference their use of FL Studio but you do have a source, take the time to add the source to the artist's personal Wikipedia article as well as to the FL Studio page.

Thanks for following these guidelines, and if your addition is deleted for not meeting the criteria, please don't take it personally. Instead, take it as encouragement to prove the artist's notability in their own entry. This criteria also applies to the intro; please keep that list short.

===FL Studio User Editing Tips===
If you know the User uses FL, then you hopefully read it somewhere online. If possible, find the source and fill the following code in with the information. Then simply paste the code after the relevant info, both on the FL Studio entry and the artist's entry.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| title       =          &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| first       =          &lt;!-- this line for author name--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| last        =          &lt;!-- this line for author name--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| url         =&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| publisher   =&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| date        =          &lt;!-- this line for article date--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| accessdate  =          &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Musicians who use FL Studio==

We shouldn't have everyone and their grandmother placing links to their myspace pages, especially when the editors are the artists themselves. Violates the editorial neutrality policy. 

From now on, try to only link artists who have DOCUMENTED experience with FL Studio through their .com, 3rd party interview, or from the official FL studio power users site. --[[User:Djdimitrious|Djdimitrious]] ([[User talk:Djdimitrious|talk]]) 16:36, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

I've capitalized the Aphex Twin addition to this list even though I - a huge Aphex Twin fan - have  never heard of him using his programme.

All notable musicians have been marked as ''&quot;Citation Needed&quot;''. Only one artist has been confirmed using FL Studio which is noted within the Wikipedia article. Anyone attempting to change this without proving an artist is using FL Studio will see their changes reverted back.

====Update====
After the major update today, the list contains FL Users where their use is referenced in a third party interview, on the FL Studio Power Users Site, or on their English Wikipedia entry. Any additions after this date where one of these three criteria aren't met, will be deleted. Thanks, [[User:MusicLover650|MusicLover650]] ([[User talk:MusicLover650|talk]]) 06:12, 17 June 2011 (UTC)

:As of my last edit, this is again the case. This article is on my watchlist, and any additions that do not meet the consensus for criteria of inclusion WILL be reverted.

:Several artists are listed because their use of FL Studio is mentioned on their English Wikipedia article, however not all of those mentions are properly cited. Additionally, it may be useful to make a distinction between whether the criteria for inclusion on the list is simply that a ''notable artist'' uses or has used FL Studio, or if it is required that there be a ''notable use'' '''of''' FL Studio '''by''' a ''notable artist''. For example, [[mario (entertainer)|Mario]] is a notable artist. But his use of FL Studio is only (AFAIK) noted in a [[Break_Up_(song)#Song_Composition|single song]] of his. Does this make his use of FL Studio notable enough to include on the notable users list? He is a notable artist, but his use of FL Studio is apparently not notable enough to be included on his main article page. Should he be included for a single use in one notable song? —[[User:Danhash|danhash]] ([[User talk:Danhash|talk]]) 15:11, 27 September 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks danhash. As far as I'm concerned, the criterion for inclusion is an independent source verifying the use of the product by a notable musician (that is, with a wiki article). Music magazines report these sorts of things, and those count--the company website does not count. That's endorsement, and we all know that endorsement does not necessarily entail actual (notable) use. An example that I'm keeping an eye on is [[Echoplex]]. Thanks again, also for your notes on my talk page. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 14:30, 30 September 2011 (UTC)

::::Hey, I think both your take on it sounds great - I have no problem shortening the list and letting it grow back over time with solid references. And I think when possible, I agree with [[User:Danhash|danhash]] that we should try and prioritize heavy users.

== Switch from &quot;FruityLoops&quot; to &quot;FL Studio&quot; and reasoning ==

It needs to be made clear that from launch to version 3.56, the program was called FruityLoops, and from Version 4.01 to present the program is called FL Studio. The name change was because of references to &quot;Fruit Loops&quot; (cereal) and &quot;Fruity&quot; (gay), and the product was becoming more complex and serious and needed a less silly name. This needs to be mentioned in the article.

== Mac OS X version ==

We need a [[wp:cite|source]] for information about a Mac OS X version. Does anybody have one?
I just removed this unsourced sentence added yesterday: &quot;''A close-to-native Mac version of FL Studio is currently in beta testing, in response to continued customer requests and increased usage of the platform.''&quot;

I also removed the following unsourced paragraph from the [[FL Studio#Editions|editions]] section:
: ''The FL Studio team announced in early September 2011 that they are seeking experienced FL Studio users with a registered copy of FL Studio to test a beta version that runs natively on [[Mac OS X]]. According to the thread on the Image-Line forum in which they announced this information, the Mac version will run in a customized [[CrossOver]] wrapper, which doesn't require the user to install CrossOver or [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]]. Beta testing will start in late September or early October of 2011.''
It's good information, but it's unsourced. The main FL Studio [http://www.image-line.com/documents/flstudio.html webpage] still lists a Mac OS X version as unavailable, with a link to further details [http://support.image-line.com/knowledgebase/base.php?id=55&amp;ans=114 here].
Does anyone have a citable source with information about a Mac version? —[[User:Danhash|danhash]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Danhash|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:26, 28 September 2011 (UTC)
