== evolution ==

I think we need a section discussing human evolution, and the creation stories of various prominent religions. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 23:48, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

:I made one. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 00:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Well done sam.  Unfortunately, you have a section of [[science]] and followed by a bit of [[mythology|myth]]ology, followed by a bit more science.  Now, whilst respecting your religious point of view, a section on science isn't the place for mythology.  The beliefs section is.  But even then for some reason the page ''starts'' with beliefs when more realistically it ought to start with basic anatomy and physical features and population data. It's bad, and it's POV pushing. [[User:Duncharris|Dunc]]|[[User talk:duncharris|&amp;#9786;]] 17:34, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::: No, Sam, this should not reflect your religious POVs, or be factually incorrect, such as this gem: &quot;While the general idea of [[natural selection]] may fit into various particular views, the evolutionary concept of [[common descent]] &amp;mdash;that humans are &quot;descended from lesser creatures&quot; &amp;mdash; is a point of great debate&quot;.  That is quite frankly [[patent nonsense]].  There is no controversy over common descent, and particularly not common descent of humans and other apes.  The evidence from genetics and palaeontology and comparative anatomy is overwhelming.  Creationism *might* get a mention in the evolution section that some people disagree with it for religious reasons.

::: Now, having said that I do now think that the structure of the beliefs section and the culture section and the consciousness section need fixing, somehow, but Sam isn't the man to do it. [[User:Duncharris|Dunc]]|[[User talk:duncharris|&amp;#9786;]] 18:39, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
::::Having watched for a bit, I'm in agreement with Dunc. - [[User:UtherSRG|UtherSRG]] [[User_talk:UtherSRG|(talk)]] 19:04, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

The evolution section can be made separate from the section on creationism if need be. Your abrasive comments are wildly unhelpful however, and I have done you the favor of disregarding them. Now, onto why I reverted. There has been long standing consensus that this article would balance religious and scientific views. [[Human#Human_beliefs_and_conceptions]] was made into the first section so as not to have religion dominate, nor be excluded from, the intro. Review the archives. Some of your thoughts (if not your words) regarding the evolution section might well be correct, and I agree it can use some work and shortening (I for one think it has too much detail regarding anthropology). But the net results of your edits were a rather intensive enforcement of a materialist POV, which not only won't work (see the archives for a history of such discussions), but will also ensure a failed FAC, something some of us have been working on for some time here. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 19:36, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:-trying to be as npov as possible, why not divided the sections into &quot;Darwinian Evolution,&quot; &quot;Biblical Creationism,&quot; etc and have an intro to the different sections as to these are a few of the current theories of origin? Im sort of new to this whole Wikipedia thing, so I dont know exactly how you all deal with opposing points of view like this--I would have thought that to be neutral, each theory should get at least a summary of its main points(?) [[User:Ego Eime|Ego Eime]] 9/26/05

::Sounds like a good idea. To be even yet more fair, we should mention the creation stories of some of the other major religions as well, not only abrahamic. A mention of their similarities might also be fascinating, such as [[Manu (Hinduism)]] and [[Noah]]. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 20:49, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== Layout, images, etc ==

It took a considerable amount of effort to get all the pics in high-resolution as requested by the peer review. It also took considerable effort to lay the page out so that all images can coexist nicely in the article, adjusting sizes to befit each image. So I object to the recent changes, deletions and additions of images. If any of you want to make changes to layout and/or images, '''please discuss beforehand''' out of respect for the hard work we have put into responding to the peer review. Thanks. I am reverting all changes. [[User:Jossifresco|&amp;asymp; jossi &amp;asymp;]] 20:20, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

==Strange locations for some information==

I find it strange that in anatomy and physiology there is a large section on tanning and then in the body image section there is a section on nutrition.  Would it be more appropriate if they were switched since they seem strange to see them under their respective sub headings? Likewise, what does sleep have to do with body image?  In this section I would expect to read about eating disorders (not from the starvation dehydration perspective)  Possibly a bit about steroids and body building and plastic surgery.  Or am I missing the point of the body image section?

There seems to be quite a bit of redundancy between the genetics and life cycle sections.  

The evolution section seems bloated compared to the other sections.  Especially since it points to two other main articles.  I find it quite strange that the creationism section is in, first, with evolution and second under the biology section.   Most people would not consider it biology.  Very few, if any practicing biologist consider it to be biology. Wouldn't this be more appropriate under the 'consciousness' heading? Or even the culture heading.

The absense of a religious section is striking.  There is a breif mention of beliefs in the culture section and that is it?  Yet there is a massive section devoted to humanism.

I am willing to make some edits but I don't want to tread of peoples feet.  [[User:Daycd|David D.]] [[User talk:Daycd|(Talk)]] 22:04, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:Scratch that last comment about religion.  Somehow I overlooked the first section on beliefs. [[User:Daycd|David D.]] [[User talk:Daycd|(Talk)]] 22:18, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

I like the sound of what your proposing, one of the most valid complaints about the article are excess and redundancy, and I favor sorting of stray and misplaced informnation. Anyone else? [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 22:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

The problem we have been having all along is between people who think materialism should dominate (humans are a chimp who thinks he's special, but isn't ''really''), and everybody else. I don't think we've had too many religious zealots come and insist apon an extremist religious POV, rather the clear consensus has been for balance, w occaisional raids from agro atheists. How that balance works out isn't a problem for me, so long as it is preserved. I for one find my body to be the least essential component of my humanity, and my soul the most important. As some people are fond of saying &quot;animals are people too!&quot; ;) [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 16:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

==Lets discuss formatting==

How should the sections be formatted? What do '''you''' think? ;) [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 16:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

Okay, tear this one apart.  Take the five main sections, rename two, and put them in this order:

# Terminology
# Biology
# Culture
# Mind
# Spirit

[[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:25, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

What I notice upon looking at the article is the overwhelming predominance of Biology. I don't know if thats ever going to change, but I wish it wasn't so. Anyways, as far as your list, why does spirit come last? I can understand terminology and biology coming 1st, but how about:

# Terminology
# Biology
# Spirit
# Mind
# Culture

[[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 11:08, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

:I'll assume you like the number of main sections and titles.  As far as the order goes, I see it as a general progression from the &quot;concrete&quot; to the &quot;subtle.&quot; :-) [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:29, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

I for one would like more summary and less specific data (esp regarding biology! ;), but I think that will be an eternal, and overall losing, battle, on this page. As per your proposed section titles and the number of them, I have no strong feelings, but they seem succinct, which is good. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 12:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

::I like the way that RDF has broken up the sections.  With regard to order is does not really bother me.  I do like the logic of starting with the more concrete and progressing to the more subtle, although, my first thought was that it was alphabetical ;).  I also agree that the article is top heavy on biology, especially given the links to other more detailed articles being prominent throughout the article.  My background is biology so I'll be happy to try and prune it when i have time.  i would not freel so confident in the other sections. Again can someone clarify the point of the body image section.  i'm still not sure of the goal/aim for that section [[User:Daycd|David D.]] [[User talk:Daycd|(Talk)]] 15:56, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

Before that.... I would propose to move the sub-section &quot;Emotion and sexuality&quot; to &quot;Culture&quot; as I think it fits much better there. (If it was only on reproduction, it would fit in &quot;Body&quot;. But that is not the case. [[User:Jossifresco|&amp;asymp; jossi &amp;asymp;]] 19:21, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

:I'd also like to see some pruning in the biology section first, if I saw this I might object to it as unbalanced, w that section being so much larger and more comprehensive than the rest. Also, if the content isn't redundant, some of it should be moved as being too specific, like some of the genetic material, hardly any readers are going to be interested in that level of detail, and if they are, it can be just a click away.

Theres nothing necesarilly wrong w any of this, but I think it should find a new home elsewhere, unless its redundant:

Partial genome sequencing resulted in these conclusions: &quot;[C]himps, gorillas, and humans form a [[clade]] of closely related species; orangutans are slightly less close phylogenetically, and gibbons are a more distant branch.&quot; [http://www.primates.com/primate/hominidae.html] &quot;To study the genomic divergences among hominoids [we] sequenced [DNA] in a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and an orangutan. The average sequence divergence was only '''1.24%''' ± 0.07% for the human-chimpanzee pair, '''1.62%''' ± 0.08% for the human-gorilla pair, and 1.63% ± 0.08% for the chimpanzee-gorilla pair. [...] The average sequence divergences between orangutans and humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were '''3.08%''' ± 0.11%, 3.12% ± 0.11%, and 3.09% ± 0.11%, respectively.&quot; [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/318206&amp;erFrom=4282301866785473000Guest]

DNA evidence supports an African origin for the maternal and paternal lineages of contemporary humans. An unintuitive complication for this debate is that the evolutionary lineage of an individual may differ from the evolutionary history of each of an individual's genes. An emerging synthesis theory proposes that the genes of contemporary humans are predominantly descendent from a recent African origin, but that interbreeding and assimilation with other hominids may have contributed genes to local populations (Templeton, 2002). Eswaran et al. (2005) speculate that &quot;as much as 80% of the nuclear genome is significantly affected by assimilation from archaic humans (i.e., 80% of loci may have some archaic admixture, not that the human genome is 80% archaic).&quot;


During the [[1990s]], variations in human [[mitochondrial DNA]] were recognised as a valuable source for reconstructing the human [[race|&quot;family tree&quot;]] and for tracing early human migrations. As a result, the ancestors of all modern humans are thought to have evolved in Africa over 150,000 years ago; modern humans began to move [[Single-origin hypothesis|out of Africa]] less than 100,000 years ago. Australia was colonised 70,000 years ago; Europe 40,000 years ago with later waves 22,000 and 9,000 years ago, according to Ornello Semino of the [[University of Pavia]] and Peter Underhill of [[Stanford University]] [http://www.duerinck.com/migrate.html]; and the Americas 30,000 years ago, with a second colonisation from across the [[Pacific Ocean]] 15,000 years ago. (See [[Human migration]].)

Since the [[Embryogenesis|human embryo]] normally takes its [[mitochondrial DNA]] from its mother's [[Ovum|egg]] and not from the [[sperm]], variations in human mitochondrial DNA provide a means of identifying those individuals who share a common [[Matrilineality|matrilineal ancestor]]. A mathematical analysis of mitochondrial DNA from thousands of living individuals suggests that the matrilineal lines for the people analysed converges on one ancestor called [[Mitochondrial Eve]] (ME) who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. That is, ME is claimed to be the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all humans alive today with respect to matrilineal descent (Boyd and Silk 2003:389&amp;ndash;99). &lt;!-- please enter the full citation in the References section--&gt;

==Creationism bit deleted, discuss==

I have removed this text from the evolution creation section:
;There is also the [[intellegent design]] movement, which intends to prove creationism by scientific means.

;While the general idea of [[natural selection]] may fit into various particular views, the evolutionary concept of [[common descent]] &amp;mdash;that humans are &quot;descended from lesser creatures&quot; &amp;mdash; is a point of great debate. Some creationists may also dispute scientific accounts of the [[origin of life]], and of the [[Age of the Earth|geological history of Earth]], [[solar nebula|the formation of the solar system]], [[Big Bang|the origin of the physical universe]], and a few even support such ideas as [[modern geocentrism|geocentrism]]. [[Argument from evolution]] and [[creation (theology)]] discuss this debate in more detail.

My reasoning is several. Firstly, I'm not sure the ID movement is about proving creationism by scientific means.  This is close to a POV. As far as I can tell even the Discovery Institute, one of the original champions of ID do not endorse it anymore. Their approach now is teach the controversy from a perspection of bringing down the so called 'icons of evolution' such as the peppered moths and Haekaels embryo's. 

Secondly, evolution does not propose that ancestors are lesser creatures. In the sentence above i cannot tell if the great debate is about the 'existance of common ancestors' or the 'descended from lesser creatures'. With reagrd to this there is really no deabte at all in the scientific community so where is the great debate? From the perspective of the US there is a debate in the high schools with regard to curriculum but i'm not sure that that debate should be in this article.  certainly not in the biology section.  

Thirdly, the other things mentioned have no bearing on this article, origin of life is not even addressed by the theory of evolution and the others are not even biology, i.e. the formation of the solar system.  This is much too broad for this article and detracts from the good points that are made.

You will note that I have not cut creationism completely. I don't want this to be a revert war.  I think what i have left will get through a FAC.  i think what I have cut will cause problems in FAC which is why I cut them now before it goes forward.  I'd be interested to here what you all think?

:I restored the images. You are welcome to go and find more suitable ones, and if you do, please make sure that are at least 1,000 pixels wide and that are not copyvios. Also removed the social infobot. (Do we really need it? ) [[User:Jossifresco|&amp;asymp; jossi &amp;asymp;]] 06:33, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

If you can find images equal or better to what is there, I am open to discuss them. I don't agree that the the pensioner or the 11 days baby image are an improvement to the article. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 10:56, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:I am looking for a better image for the foetus, to replace the baby pic. As for the pensioner, I thought it worked because we can see progression from baby or pre-born, childood and then elderly. If you pefer a photo of a man, pl;ease find one that is high-res. Thanks.[[User:Jossifresco|&amp;asymp; jossi &amp;asymp;]] 15:24, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

I'll be frank. I find the pensioner unattractive, and find the baby image less than &quot;Featured image&quot; material. I kinda liked having a wikipedian in the article, but I guess I can understand hi-res concerns. Ergo, in sum, I am willing to compromise, despite liking my way better. (I'm pretty sure there isn't a hi-res requirement for FAC's). [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 17:35, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
