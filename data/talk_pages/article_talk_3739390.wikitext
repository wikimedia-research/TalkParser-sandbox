== User page ==

I've moved your article to [[User:Mfmoran]].  As you'll see from [[Wikipedia:Vanity guidelines]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I hope that you'll stay and contribute to Wikipedia, using the knowledge that you evidently have.  To that end:

&lt;div style=&quot;align: center; padding: 1em; border: solid 2px yellow; background-color: darkblue;&quot;&gt;
&lt;center &gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot; color=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;'''Hello, {{PAGENAME}}, &lt;font color=&quot;lightblue&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome]]&lt;/font&gt; to Wikipedia!&lt;/font &gt;&lt;/center &gt;&lt;/div &gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;align: center; padding: 1em; border: solid 2px black; background-color: white;&quot;&gt;		 
&lt;center &gt;'''I hope you like working here and want to [[Wikipedia:wikipedians|continue]]. If you need help on how to name new articles, look at the [[Wikipedia:Guide to layout|Guide to Layout]], and for help on formatting the pages visit the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]. If you need general help, look at [[Wikipedia:Help|Help]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ|the FAQ]], and if you can't find your answer there, check the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village Pump]] (for Wikipedia related questions) or the [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|Reference Desk]] (for general questions).  There's still more help at the [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]] and the [[Wikipedia:Policy Library|Policy Library]].  Also, don't forget to visit the [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]] &amp;mdash; and if you have any more questions after that, feel free to post them on [[User talk:Mel Etitis/New users|my New-Users' Talk Page]].'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Additional tips:'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:Here are some extra tips to help you get around Wikipedia:
:*If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills, try the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]].
:*Click on the Edit button on a page, and look at how other editors did what they did.
:*You can sign your name using three tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;. If you use four, you can add a datestamp too.  Always sign comments on Talk pages, never sign Articles.
:*You might want to add yourself to the [[Wikipedia:New user log|New User Log]]
:*If your first language isn't English, try [[Wikipedia:Contributing to articles outside your native language]]
:*Full details on Wikipedia style can be found in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]].

&lt;center&gt;There's also a regular [[Wikipedia:Bootcamp|group introduction to Wikipedia for new users]] on IRC.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center &gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;'''Happy editing!'''&lt;/font &gt;&lt;/center &gt;
