==Malbec Argente?==
Is it also sometimes called &quot;Malbec Argente,&quot; as mentioned in the [[Malbec]] article?  [[User:Badagnani|Badagnani]] 20:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

According to Jancis Robinson it is. I added it as a redirect but just didn't add it to the article. [[User:Agne27|Agne]] 06:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
