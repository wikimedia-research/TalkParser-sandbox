The following is a highly and confused paragraph that was extracted from the article. It is hinting at a correct observation, but needs to be re-written to explain the facts properly (it is wrong at the moment). --[[User:dmb000006|Dan]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Dmb000006|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

''The physical interactions holding protein complexes together are, in general, weaker and more polar than those holding the tertiary structure together.  Hence, it is sometimes possible to cause a complex to dissociate into folded protein monomers, e.g., by high pressure or high salt concentrations.''
