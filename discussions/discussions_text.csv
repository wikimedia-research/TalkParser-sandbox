This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but I've never been more frustrated with Wikipedia. I am most adamantly not wrong, no matter what the current Strauss family desires, it is impossible to go back in time and alter reality. Johann Strau√ü did not live nowadays, so what is done now has nothing to do with what happened in the mid-19th century. If the Strauss family wants their name spelled that way now, that's their choice, but it's not possible to change the past. I have seen his autograph with an &quot;√ü&quot; in his own handwritin

On the other hand, Johann Strauss' own signature [http://www.maurice-abravanel.com/a_handt_Strauss_Johann_Junior_gif_gif.gif] clearly shows an '''√ü'''.

I have been asked to give here my statement: I have an originally signed autograph by Johann Strau√ü. It is signed by Strau√ü with an √ü-letter at the End. My parents live in the house in the 2nd district of Vienna, where Johann Strau√ü II (son) has been born and where Johann Strau√ü (vather) lived. On the top of the entrance is also a sign where &quot;Strau√ü&quot; is written on it. Greetings from Vienna,
81	74	78	71	0	30667611	22793412	74	-1	-1	-1	0	-1	0	-1	In Austria, the name ist mostly spelled &quot;Strau√ü&quot;, even though in the 19th century both spellings were common (partly depending on which founts were used in printing). Nevertheless, a friend of mine who is a descendant of Johann Strau√ü Snr and Eduard Strau√ü also spelled his name &quot;Strau√ü&quot; until he officially had it changed to &quot;Strauss&quot; because of his many contacts to England since &quot;√ü&quot; is unknown in English. For the very same reason the Johann-Strauss-Society of Vienna spells the name this  way. On the other hand, in English language literature the spelling &quot;Strauss&quot; is indeed in use (e.g. ''Peter Kemp: The Strauss Family. Portrait of a Musical Dynasty.'' ISBN 0-8593-6265-5). Whether an English language encyclopaedia should use the one spelling or the other I cannot decide, but I do think that the sort of spelling common in the country of origin should at least be mentioned. --[[User:80.109.27.92|80.109.27.92]] 22:24, 24 October 2005 (UTC) ([[:de:Benutzer:Wolfgang glock|Wolfgang Glock]])   <LF>

The text beneath the 1883 caricature translates:   <LF>   : ''Strucz J√°nos is nobody else than Johann Strauss, Schani, translated into Hungarian, the prototypical Viennese Waltz composer, hardly conceivable without Vienna, and owes all his artistic successes to the genuine, authentic Viennicism, which lives and weaves in his fibers.  He has requested for his dismissal from the Austrian state federation, and intends to ''magyarise'' himself. Now it's your turn, &quot;old Steffel&quot;: replace the organ sound at your feet by clinking spurs, put a red feather into your hat instead of the empirial eagle and let yourself grow a long mustache, ''ker√©m al√°san''! But stop, dear Steffel, why do injustice to you? You belong to the most dignified clergy and have sworn celibate, you are an old, unmarried bachelor for centuries and you remain one, otherwise the old spinsters would not rub against you. Strauss however is not an old bachelor. He already left two life companions behind himself; the one took the dear God, and the other one? - well, you know the strange story! Now his large artist's heart longs for a third, and since he is already in changing things, who cares if he changes faith and affiliation at the same time!''   <LF>   : If I got that right, &quot;Steffel&quot; here refers to [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]].

Anyway, the Nazis knew about the Jewish great-grandfather and, because of Strauss' popularity, faked some documents and suppressed the fact so their music could continue to be played; see [[:de:Johann Strauss (Sohn)#Nationalsozialismus]].

Did he compose his works on an instrument, or was an instrument was required at all?
